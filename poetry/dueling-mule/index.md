# Dueling a Mule

A Money and Mule had met for a duel. The Monkey sat high in a tree. The Mule said "Come down. Let's duel on the ground." The Monkey just cried out with glee!

Then proceeded with cool to ventilate Mule. And to his shock and surprise, Mule's final endeavor was wondering whether Dueling a Monkey was wise.
