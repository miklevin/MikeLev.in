# The Llama and Yak

A llama and yak were bought by a hack On behalf of a much better man. "You'll get them...", he said, but what happened instead Is they arrived and he took them and ran!

The hack said he ran, 'cause he had a plan To make better use of the stock. What he missed at first glance, was he hadn't a chance And justice came as a great shock!

The moral, you see, if you steal and you flee You had better consider your plan. If you !@%$#%@ -up instead, then you loose all your cred And are seen as much less of a man!
