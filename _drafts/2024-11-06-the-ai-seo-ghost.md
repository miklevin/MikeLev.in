FastHTML is aptly named. It is soooo fast. Everything feels sped up, but it's
because you're using HTML the way it was meant to be; lightweight and no
overhead. Think how weak of mid-90s machines the Web revolution was born on.
It's only the JavaScript bloat of modern frameworks that give things that
stuck-in-molasses feeling where things happen slower than you can click.

FastHTML is so friggn fast because the HTMX protocol it's built on is
beautifully paired with the HTTP and HTML proptocols it sits on. It's as if the
whole Web were just thought out better from the start, and JavaScript didn't
take us down these winding paths of nested frameworks and virtual DOMs. 

And what's better, with fast code comes less code. And with less code comes an
LLM's ability to know the code better. And if that code were the LLM's "body",
such as it were, then the LLM can know the details of its body. And because LLMs
can code and their body is code, they can be good at self-improvement.
