# Improve Your Life Through Journaling

## So much to say, maybe just read The Artists Way

I'll build this page out shortly. Meanwhile check out
[YAMLchop](https://github.com/miklevin/yamlchop) at Github. It's used to
create the [blog](/blog/) section of this website, for example. And you can
describe the gist of it in this poem:

> I'm building better blogging  
> To replace a bygone era  
> Where your CMS is flogging  
> You to take up something clearer,  
> So you catalog your cat tales  
> In one file for the hashing  
> Using YAML for the data  
> And then Jekyll for the lashing.
