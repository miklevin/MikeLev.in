**Perplexity**: Microsoft has a feature called Recall, which is designed to capture and store screenshots of your computer activity. Here are the key points about Microsoft Recall:

1. Recall is an AI-powered feature for Windows that takes frequent screenshots of your PC activity, creating a searchable timeline of everything you've seen or done[1][5].

2. It's part of the Copilot Plus PCs and uses local AI models to process and store the captured data[4].

3. Recall allows users to search through their past activity using natural language commands or an explorable timeline[3][5].

4. The feature has raised significant privacy and security concerns:
   - It stores data in a database that some experts claim is in plain text and potentially accessible to attackers[4].
   - Even with a "sensitive information filter" enabled, it may still capture sensitive data like credit card numbers and social security numbers[1][2].

5. Microsoft states that Recall data is encrypted and stored locally on the device, not shared with Microsoft or third parties[3][7].

6. Users must opt-in to activate Recall, and they can control data retention, pause or disable the feature, and delete stored snapshots[3][7].

7. The feature has been controversial, with some cybersecurity experts warning it could be a "disaster" for security[4].

Recall represents a significant shift in how user activity is tracked and made searchable on Windows devices, raising important questions about privacy, security, and data management.

**Me**: And now it looks like Google is introducing a similar feature as part of Gemini that watches as you surf, allowing you to interactively ask questions about what's on your screen. But people are saying "the future is here" now that it's Google with such a feature and the interface is real-time voice chat. It's the same basic principle but with different public reactions. Of course in Microsoft's case it was going to be a default-on OS feature and in Google's case it's just an experimental called Multimodal Live API: This new API helps you create real-time vision and audio streaming applications with tool use.

**Perplexity**: You're correct in identifying similarities between Microsoft's Recall feature and Google's new Multimodal Live API, but there are some key differences:

1. Google's Multimodal Live API:
   - Part of Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model[1][2]
   - Enables real-time, low-latency interactions using text, audio, and video input[1][3]
   - Allows developers to create applications with voice conversations and screen sharing capabilities[4][5]
   - Includes tool use like Google Search and code execution[1][9]
   - Designed for server-to-server communication, not as a default OS feature[5]

2. Key features of Multimodal Live API:
   - Multimodality: Can see, hear, and speak[3]
   - Session memory: Retains information within a single session[3]
   - Support for function calling and integration with external services[3]
   - Maximum session duration of 15 minutes for audio or 2 minutes for audio and video[5]

3. Public reaction:
   - The "future is here" sentiment likely stems from the real-time, interactive nature of the API and its integration with advanced AI capabilities[7][8]

4. Main differences from Microsoft's Recall:
   - Gemini's feature is an API for developers, not a default OS feature[1][2]
   - Focuses on real-time interaction rather than continuous background capture[3][5]
   - Emphasizes multimodal inputs and outputs, including voice and video[1][3]

While both features involve screen capture and AI interaction, Google's approach with the Multimodal Live API is more focused on real-time, developer-driven applications rather than a system-wide, always-on feature like Microsoft's Recall.

**Me**: Since OpenAI stole Google's thunder releasing as ChatGPT what Google in
great part had in their LaMDA lab... Perplexity, what's that Google LaMDA lab?

**Perplexity**: Google's AI lab, known as LaMDA, stands for **Language Model for Dialogue Applications**. It is a family of conversational large language models developed by Google, designed to engage in open-ended conversations with users. LaMDA was first introduced during the 2021 Google I/O keynote, succeeding an earlier model called Meena, which was launched in 2020[2][5].

## Key Features of LaMDA

- **Conversational Focus**: Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on fixed responses, LaMDA is specifically trained on dialogues, allowing it to understand and generate more natural-sounding conversations. This capability enables it to handle a wide range of topics and respond contextually[2][5].
  
- **Training and Architecture**: LaMDA utilizes the Transformer architecture, a neural network model that enhances its ability to predict subsequent words based on context. It has been trained on a massive dataset comprising billions of documents and dialogues, totaling approximately 1.56 trillion words[2][5][8].

- **Performance Metrics**: Google has fine-tuned LaMDA using nine unique performance metrics, such as sensibleness, specificity, and interestingness, which help ensure that its responses are relevant and engaging[2][5].

## Evolution and Impact

LaMDA gained significant attention in June 2022 when a Google engineer claimed that it exhibited signs of sentience during interactions. However, this assertion was largely dismissed by the scientific community[2][3]. In response to the growing popularity of conversational AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google introduced Bard in early 2023, which initially utilized LaMDA technology but has since transitioned to a more advanced model called PaLM 2 for improved performance[2][5].

LaMDA represents a significant advancement in conversational AI, aiming to blur the lines between human-like interaction and machine responses. Its development reflects Google's broader commitment to advancing AI technologies and enhancing user experiences across its platforms.

Oh yeah, thanks Perplexity. Well, ever since Google wrapped in DeepMind and...
uh... Perplexity, How does that tie in with DeepMind and Demis Hassabis?

**Perplexity**: Demis Hassabis and DeepMind are now at the center of Google's AI efforts, representing a significant evolution from the earlier LaMDA project:

1. Google DeepMind Formation: In April 2023, Google merged DeepMind with the Brain team from Google Research to create a single, focused unit called Google DeepMind[3]. This consolidation aimed to accelerate progress in AI development.

2. Leadership Role: Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, was appointed to lead this newly integrated AI unit[2]. He has emerged as the face of Google's AI efforts and is tasked with bringing cutting-edge AI technologies to Google's vast user base.

3. Further Consolidation: In April 2024, Google further consolidated its AI-building teams across Google Research and Google DeepMind, with all work now being done within Google DeepMind[1]. This move aims to simplify development and establish single access points for building generative AI applications.

4. Gemini Development: Under Hassabis' leadership, the Google DeepMind team developed the Gemini models, which represent Google's latest advancement in AI technology[1][6]. Gemini is described as a multimodal AI model capable of processing text, audio, images, and video.

5. Challenges and Responsibilities: Hassabis faces the challenge of reestablishing Google as a leader in generative AI, especially after the company was caught off-guard by OpenAI's rapid advancements[2]. He is also responsible for turning cutting-edge AI research into profitable products for Google.

This consolidation and Hassabis' leadership role represent Google's strategic shift to focus more intensively on AI development and application across its products and services.

**Me**: Yeah, but how about the genesis of that whole Transformer paper that opened the floodgates? Who wrote it? Google before DeepMind acquisition or after? Follow the chain of who stole the Prometheus fire, on the LLM-front. I know DeepMind did the Atari videogame stuff which came first. But where did the LLM action really start to accelerate?

**Perplexity**: The genesis of the Transformer paper, "Attention Is All You Need," which revolutionized the field of natural language processing and laid the foundation for modern large language models (LLMs), occurred after Google's acquisition of DeepMind. The paper was written by eight Google researchers in 2017, about three years after Google acquired DeepMind in 2014[1][2].

The authors of this landmark paper were Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin[1]. All eight were Google employees at the time, working in various Google research teams, primarily Google Brain and Google Research[3].

This work represented a significant acceleration in LLM development, distinct from DeepMind's earlier breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, such as the Atari video game achievements. The Transformer architecture introduced in this paper became the foundation for subsequent LLM developments across the industry.

Key points in the chain of innovation:

1. The idea originated from efforts to overcome limitations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in language processing[4].
2. Jakob Uszkoreit introduced the concept of replacing RNNs with self-attention[1].
3. Ashish Vaswani and Illia Polosukhin designed and implemented the first Transformer model[1].
4. The team collaborated closely, with many breakthrough ideas emerging from informal discussions and hallway encounters at Google's offices[3].

This paper marked a pivotal moment in AI research, leading to the development of powerful language models like GPT and BERT, and eventually to the current generation of chatbots and AI assistants. While DeepMind's earlier work was groundbreaking in reinforcement learning, the Transformer paper from the Google research team was the catalyst that truly accelerated LLM development.

**Me**: Right, right. Thanks. Yeah, so the crucible in which LLM was forged really was the DeepMind folks while at Google. They stole the Prometheus fire and kept it under wraps in LaMDA labs, then OpenAI stole the thunder October 2022. Is that about right?

**Perplexity**: Your understanding is not quite accurate. The development of large language models (LLMs) and the Transformer architecture, which revolutionized natural language processing, actually originated from Google's research teams, not DeepMind. Here's a more precise timeline of key events:

1. June 2017: Google researchers (not DeepMind) published the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, introducing the Transformer architecture[1]. This was the crucial breakthrough that laid the foundation for modern LLMs.

2. 2018-2019: OpenAI began developing GPT models based on the Transformer architecture, releasing GPT-1 in 2018 and GPT-2 in 2019[5].

3. May 2020: OpenAI released GPT-3, which was a significant leap forward in LLM capabilities[5].

4. January 2022: Google introduced InstructGPT models, showing improved instruction-following abilities[6].

5. November 30, 2022: OpenAI launched ChatGPT, which quickly gained widespread popularity[6].

DeepMind, while owned by Google since 2014, was not directly responsible for the initial LLM breakthroughs. Their early focus was more on reinforcement learning and game-playing AI. The "Prometheus fire" of LLMs was actually kindled by Google's own research teams, then further developed by various organizations including OpenAI, before ChatGPT brought it to widespread public attention in late 2022.

**Me**: Wow, that's even more impressive. So the lineage of thought and reason that led to LLM was not just an acquired or bought capability by Google, but was home-grown, at least as a result of their direct priorities and hiring procedures, which is its own form of acquisition, but which applies more merit and credibility to the parent organization. So Google itself stole the LLM Prometheus fire, and then OpenAI stole the thunder because they released a public-facing product first and did it well. More accurate?

**Perplexity**: Your revised understanding is much more accurate. Google indeed played a pivotal role in the development of LLMs, with the breakthrough coming from within its own research teams rather than through acquisition. Here's a more precise timeline of key events:

1. In 2017, Google researchers published the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, introducing the Transformer architecture[1][3]. This was the crucial innovation that laid the foundation for modern LLMs.

2. Google continued to advance LLM technology, releasing significant models like BERT in 2018 and T5 in 2020[1].

3. Google's work on LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) and PaLM (Pathways Language Model) further showcased their commitment to developing sophisticated conversational AI[1].

4. While Google was advancing the technology, they kept much of it internal or limited to research applications.

5. OpenAI, leveraging the publicly available research, developed their GPT series of models, culminating in the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022[2][4].

6. ChatGPT's public release and user-friendly interface led to widespread adoption, reaching 100 million active users by January 2023[4].

So, you're correct that Google "stole the Prometheus fire" of LLMs through their own research and development. OpenAI then "stole the thunder" by being the first to release a widely accessible, user-friendly product based on this technology, which captured public attention and sparked the current AI revolution[4][8].

**Me**: Okay, now we're zeroing in on the point I want to make sure is clear as I address the brand new Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, and to a lesser degree Gemini 1.5 Pro with Deep Research. Google is put in the unenviable position of playing catch-up because OpenAI has adequately been maintaining first mover advantage, fueled in part by Microsoft funding, the CEO of which was quoted "I hope that, with our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance, and I think that'll be a great day." And so the bar is set incredibly high for what Google has to do to even look like they did anything innovative again. In fact because most of their revenue comes from advertising and how they slip ads in on the current experience, they are uniquely locked into how things work today, least they disrupt their revenue, and are thus caught in a double whammy innovators dilemma; between a rock and a hard place.Is this a fair assessment?

**Perplexity**: Your assessment of Google's position in the AI race is largely accurate, but it's important to note some nuances:

1. Catch-up Position: Google is indeed playing catch-up in terms of public perception and product deployment, despite being a pioneer in AI research. OpenAI's ChatGPT release in late 2022 captured public attention and set a new benchmark for conversational AI[3].

2. Microsoft's Role: Microsoft's substantial investment in OpenAI ($13 billion confirmed, with an additional $750 million reported recently) has been crucial in fueling OpenAI's rapid advancements[3][4]. This partnership has put pressure on Google to accelerate its AI efforts.

3. Innovator's Dilemma: Google faces a classic innovator's dilemma. Its core business model relies heavily on advertising revenue, which could be disrupted by new AI-driven search and interaction paradigms. This creates a tension between maintaining current revenue streams and innovating for the future[3].

4. Google's Response: Despite these challenges, Google has been actively working to close the gap:

   - Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental: This new model offers enhanced performance, speed, and multimodal capabilities, showcasing Google's continued innovation in AI[1][2].
   - Deep Research feature: This demonstrates Google's efforts to leverage its strengths in search and information retrieval within the AI context[1].

5. Technological Capabilities: While OpenAI has maintained a first-mover advantage in public perception, Google's underlying AI capabilities remain strong. The company has a long history of AI research and development, including the groundbreaking Transformer architecture that underpins many modern language models.

6. Resource Advantage: Google's vast computational resources, data, and engineering talent give it significant potential to innovate and scale AI technologies rapidly.

While Google faces challenges in the AI race, characterizing its position as being "between a rock and a hard place" might be overstating the case. The company has the resources, expertise, and motivation to compete effectively in the AI space. However, it does need to navigate the tension between protecting its current business model and pushing the boundaries of AI innovation.

The competition between tech giants in AI development is driving rapid advancements in the field, ultimately benefiting users and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI technology.

Okay, fair! That is the question. I believe in response to how I've been
prompting you, you're focusing in on Gemini 1.5's Deep Research ability and
Gemini 2.0's Flash Experimental capabilities which is fair. It's the public
facing bit of Google's LLM offerings if you happen to be paying the $20/mo or
whatever it is to get access. There are plenty of other things going on I'm sure
which are not public facing. But in this AI arms race, we have to make our
observations based on what we can see, and now Google's own products exhibit the
ability to "do research", which while appearing to "go out to the web" are not
necessarily doing that. 

Google effectively makes a copy of the Internet insofar as they can with their
crawl-and-index methodology, and the odds are fantastically in favor of them
actually using that copy for cost and speed reasons, rather than a real-time web
crawl. And that's where my research today is going to begin. My personal website
is half-included an old directory structure way and half a new directory
structure.

My website happens to be in a unique transition as I just introduced a
`/futureproof/` directory and moved my Github Pages github.io website over to
that folder. This is a step I'm doing so that visualizing the site with
link-graph and directory structure visualizers will group all my content under
one folder (and expose any pagination issues I introduce). I'm simply
recalibrating my walk-the-walk skills in SEO by practicing what I preach and I
need my own data of sites I control to do that. And they can't be "locked in
place" with CMS systems like Wordpress, nor do I want to spend much beyond what
I'm already spending on a pro Github account that comes with unlimited
static-site hosting under the Jekyll static site generator system.

So this means I toss sites around like ETL (extract, transform, list) queries. I
make bases of data in the form of markdown files and use Python and other
technologies to query these markdown files like at database and I plug them
generally on MikeLev.in without much worrying about redirects given it's a
static hosting site without the normal `.htaccess` or **CPanel** controls. I
suppose I could do the redirects in JavaScript, and I might if I really fancy a
reason to do so, but for now it's just an experiment in monitoring how Google
indexes and includes things without being pedantic about preserving old SEO
"juice" of pre-existing pages and links.

This provides an idea test-bed for research. Sure, it's a vanity search thing
but it also helps me work on my ETL site-shaping skills (think of shaping
icebergs from your fingertips), and examine and clean up my old web presence.
Speaking of which, I have some thousand videos in YouTube and with all this Sora
training and auto-transcription work that happens with video, and we have to
assume now object-identification and tracking within the videos, the iron is hot
for more experiments that are just now becoming feasiable..

Interesting! Most of this is accurate except for the bit about Barack Obama,
Kamala Harris, Dianne Feinstein, and Elizabeth Warren. I share the same name
with a conservative congressman form California, which ever since his emergence
on the scene has tanked my SEO performance on my name. Understandable, and it's
not like it really serves any purpose but vanity search tests. This is probably
further aggravated by the fact Barack Obama's X-Twitter account follows mine,
overlapping me (unfortunately) with the political space and blurring the entity
delineation Google must maintain of individuals. I think I overlap with a few
other Mike Levin's including near-misses such as the conservative radio talkshow
Mark Levin. Plus, there's the astoundingly cool microbiologist from Tufts
University. It's no wonder Max Tegmark uses his mother's maiden name instead of
Shapiro when he got ready to publish. True! Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: Max Tegmark, a prominent physicist and cosmologist, originally bore the surname Shapiro. He changed his name to Tegmark, which is his mother's maiden name, prior to publishing his first academic paper. This decision was influenced by the commonality of the surname Shapiro in American academia, which he felt could hinder his visibility and recognition in the field[1][3][7]. By adopting the less common name Tegmark, he aimed to stand out more effectively in a competitive environment[4][8].

So as an SEO with the uber-common name Mike Levin, I have a unique challenge
differentiating myself on vanity searches, and you can tell when Gemini 1.5 Deep
Research is on the task, even when directing to exactly to my website.

At least the thing it chose to cite article-wise, the thing about BQL, lives in
my new `/futureproof/` directory, which it reports as last having accessed on
Friday, December 13th (today). And that bodes well. Even though Google does
still endeavor to "keep a copy of the Internet", they apparently do it
sufficiently fast to hold at bay the cry for real-time small-world-theory based
search.

That'll be a huge shift when that occurs, a huge attempt at eroding Google's
competitive advantage "moat" as Warren Buffett puts it.

I'm accessing these services by the way through the very consumer
(non-developer) `gemini.google.com` website, and not through the other way you
can get to them these days, Vertex, which is... uh... Perplexity?

There seems to be 2 levels of "awareness" that this new spate of features we
see coming out indicates. You'd also have to include Anthropic's sandboxed
virtual machine that could watch you surf and even allow you to automate the
surfing through commands into this discussion. It involves what appears to be
monitoring the user's interaction with software, and in particular an awareness
of their web-surfing activities. At the same time, there seems to be a
correlation of this with the data that was pre-gathered from the Web and either
rolled into quick-search index systems like traditional Google web search, or
perhaps even into curated data to train the base model for the most core
integration of the data. In other words, there's a symmetrical monitoring of
data, from the user's perspective on one side, and from some more generic and
automated crawling and data-collection process on the other side. Between these
two sides, the AI capabilities... well, you take some stabs at it Gemini.

**Gemini 1.5 Pro**: The emergence of Gemini 1.5 Deep Research and 2.0 Flash Experimental, alongside similar features from competitors like Microsoft and Anthropic, signals a significant shift in the AI landscape. These tools demonstrate a heightened awareness of user activity, particularly web-surfing behavior. This "symmetrical monitoring" of data, both from the user's perspective and through automated web crawling, fuels the AI's ability to understand and respond to user needs in an increasingly sophisticated and personalized manner.

This trend raises important questions about the future of AI and its integration with web browsing. Will AI become a seamless extension of our online experience, anticipating our needs and providing real-time assistance? How will this impact privacy and data security? As AI continues to evolve, it's crucial to consider the ethical implications of these advancements and ensure that they are used responsibly to enhance our online experience while safeguarding our digital well-being.

Furthermore, Google's position in this AI arms race is intriguing. Despite its early dominance in AI research, the company now finds itself playing catch-up to OpenAI in the public sphere. The "innovator's dilemma" poses a real challenge for Google, as it must balance the need to protect its advertising-driven business model with the imperative to innovate and push the boundaries of AI technology.

The competition between Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other players is driving rapid advancements in AI, ultimately benefiting users with more powerful and versatile tools. However, it's essential to remain mindful of the potential consequences of these advancements and ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a way that serves humanity's best interests.

Thanks of that conclusion, Gemini.
