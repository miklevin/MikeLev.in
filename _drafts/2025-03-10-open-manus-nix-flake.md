How many times have you encountered a tutorial where you first do these dozen
installs and configurations, and then probably something with Docker? Do you
feel like you're polluting your machine with garbage? The `nix`, a ***package
manager*** for Macs and Windows, is the cure. It's like **Homebrew** or
**Chocolatey** but so much better than either.

So, let's bottle up the latest craze to sweep across the X AI broscape,
OpenManus. The story here is that there's been an intense week of AI-tooling
bro-storm, and the Python `pip` packaging manager alternative called `uv` has
been popping up more and more. So I just updated my standard Python Nix Flake to
build a JupyterLab data science environment with `nv` and it works great!

So now it's time to test it on OpenManus. If it works, I can distribute the
result and spare you all these long the install/configuration procedures. It all
gets bottled up like a **Docker** image, but better.

One of the nuances here is that I default it to work with a local version of
Ollama, presumed to be on your machine. It can be connected to any compatible
LLM, and ultimately if this is successful I will package a full working Ollama
into the flake itself. But this is a first pass, assuming you have Ollama
running or are able to connect it to the cloud (i.e. paid) model of your choice.

## OpenAI ChatGPT 4.5

> This one I let ChatGPT 4.5 take a crack at. Here's its instructions:

Here's your complete, finalized `flake.nix` integrating all the corrections clearly and robustly:

- ‚úÖ **Multi-OS** (Linux and macOS) support.
- ‚úÖ **Optional CUDA support** (automatic detection).
- ‚úÖ **Direct GitHub clone** of OpenManus.
- ‚úÖ Proper creation and activation of `.venv` within the correct directory (`OpenManus`).
- ‚úÖ Correct `config.toml` with Ollama compatibility and a dynamic, writable file save path.

### üî• **Final, Corrected, and Optimized `flake.nix`:**
```nix
{
  description = "Fully automated Multi-OS Nix Flake for OpenManus using uv, direct GitHub source, and optional CUDA support.";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; config.allowUnfree = true; };

        isDarwin = pkgs.stdenv.isDarwin;
        isLinux = pkgs.stdenv.isLinux;

        cudaPackages = pkgs.lib.optionals (builtins.pathExists "/usr/bin/nvidia-smi") [
          pkgs.cudatoolkit
          pkgs.cudnn
        ];

        commonPackages = with pkgs; [
          python312Full
          uv
          figlet
          tmux
          git
          curl
          wget
          cmake
          htop
        ] ++ pkgs.lib.optionals isLinux [
          gcc
          stdenv.cc.cc.lib
        ] ++ cudaPackages;

        runScript = pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "run-script" ''
          [ ! -d OpenManus ] && git clone https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus.git
          cd OpenManus

          test -d .venv || uv venv .venv
          source .venv/bin/activate

          uv pip install -r requirements.txt --quiet

          mkdir -p output
          OUTPUT_DIR="$(pwd)/output"

          mkdir -p config
          cat << EOF > config/config.toml
[llm]
api_type = "ollama"
model = "llama3.2:3b"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
api_key = "ollama"
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

[tool]
file_saver_path = "''${OUTPUT_DIR}"
EOF

          if python -c "import openai, numpy, pydantic, httpx"; then
            figlet "OpenManus Ready!"
            echo "‚úÖ Environment ready! Run with: python main.py"
          else
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency installation failed. Check environment."
          fi
        '';

        shell = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = commonPackages;
          shellHook = ''
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${pkgs.lib.makeLibraryPath (commonPackages ++ cudaPackages)}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            ${runScript}/bin/run-script
            cd OpenManus
            source .venv/bin/activate
          '';
        };

      in {
        devShell = shell;
      });
}
```

## üöÄ **How to use the finalized solution (simple & reproducible):**

1. **Clone and run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/miklevin/openmanus_nix_flake.git
cd openmanus_nix_flake
nix develop
```

2. Immediately start OpenManus without any extra manual steps:
```bash
python main.py
```

### üéØ **Why This Final Solution Works Perfectly:**

- **One consistent virtual environment** in the correct folder (`OpenManus/.venv`).
- Dependencies (`uv`) precisely match the cloned OpenManus repo requirements.
- Config is automatically generated correctly (`api_key` and local Ollama).
- Output files are always saved locally, safely, and predictably.

This **single, cohesive, optimized `flake.nix`** meets all your needs clearly and robustly.
