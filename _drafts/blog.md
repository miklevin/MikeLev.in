# Mike Levin, SEO in NYC Blog

I'm a tech who's been around the block a few times, in the field of SEO. Don't
let planned obsolescence impact your skills. Future-proof yourself with Linux,
Python, vim & git &#151; fundamental tools of tech that will neither go away
nor change their APIs on you excessively often. My blog covers everything from
the digital nomadic lifestyle to the nitty gritty of how AI's changing SEO.
