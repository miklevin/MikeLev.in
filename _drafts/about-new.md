# About Mike Levin: Technology Veteran and Future-Proofing Advocate

## Background in Technology

**Q: Mike, can you tell us about your background in technology?**

A: I'm a technology veteran with decades of experience, currently in my 50s. I've seen the evolution of computing from the days of the Amiga to our current AI-driven era. My passion lies in future-proofing tech skills and helping others navigate the rapidly changing landscape of technology.

## Philosophy on Staying Relevant

**Q: What's your philosophy when it comes to staying relevant in tech?**

A: I believe in mastering a set of fundamental, versatile tools that I call the "LPvg stack":

- **L**inux
- **P**ython
- **v**im
- **g**it

These form the core of what I consider a future-proof skill set. I advocate for avoiding the "hamster wheel" of constantly chasing the latest tech trends and instead focusing on timeless fundamentals that remain relevant across different eras of technology.

## Approach to Technology and Development

**Q: Can you elaborate on your approach to technology and development?**

A: I'm a strong proponent of open-source technologies and reproducible environments. I've developed a comprehensive approach that includes tools like:

- NixOS
- Jupyter Notebooks
- FastHTML

I believe in creating portable, reproducible development environments that can be spun up anywhere, anytime. This approach emphasizes independence, adaptability, and sustainability in software development.

## Views on AI in Technology

**Q: How do you view the role of AI in the future of technology?**

A: I see AI as a transformative force, but I don't believe it will replace the need for solid coding skills. Instead, I advocate for integrating AI tools like local LLMs (Language Model Models) into our development workflows. I'm particularly interested in how we can use AI to enhance productivity while maintaining control over our development processes.

## Key Focus Areas

**Q: What are some of the key topics you focus on in your writing and teaching?**

A: I cover a range of topics including:

- Mastering the LPvg (Linux, Python, vim, git) stack
- Improving math skills for better tech understanding
- Staying competitive in a changing job market
- Integrating AI tools into development workflows
- Creating reproducible development environments with tools like NixOS
- Web development using Python-centric tools like FastHTML

## Empowering Domain Experts with Tech Skills

**Q: You emphasize that one doesn't need to be a full-time developer to benefit from these skills. Can you elaborate on that?**

A: Absolutely. I strongly believe that you don't have to be a dedicated developer to benefit from these technical skills. In fact, I advocate for a different approach:

1. Become an expert in your chosen field or domain - whatever truly excites you.
2. Develop tech skills as a complementary toolset to enhance your primary expertise.

This combination allows you to:

- Maintain independence and agency in your work
- Automate tasks and improve efficiency in your domain
- Bridge the gap between your field and technology
- Adapt quickly to technological changes in your industry
- Prototype and implement ideas without always relying on dedicated developers

The goal is to empower professionals across various fields - be it marketing, finance, science, or arts - with the ability to leverage technology effectively. This approach not only makes you more versatile but also opens up unique opportunities at the intersection of your domain expertise and tech skills.

## Vision for the Future

**Q: What's your vision for the future of technology and skill development?**

A: I believe in a future where developers have more agency and autonomy. By mastering a set of versatile, fundamental tools, we can adapt to any technological change. My goal is to help people build a skill set that:

1. Resists obsolescence
2. Allows for creativity and problem-solving
3. Provides a consistent foundation for tackling any project or challenge in the tech world
