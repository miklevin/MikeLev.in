## Recovering from Momentum Break

The best thing you can do for yourself is to re-spark your motivation after a 
period of intense effort and necessary recovery. Over-exertion is actually a 
necessary thing in accomplishment. There's a lot to be said for pacing and 
consistency over time, but each of those consistent, measured circadian rhythm 
moments has an upper-bounds, something that cannot be easily exceeded or overcome 
without the occasional extraordinary effort &#151; using the motivation while you 
have it and surmounting previously insurmountable obstacles. It's not an everyday 
sort of thing, but it is occasionally necessary. Extraordinary achieving sometimes 
takes extraordinary effort &#151; pushing yourself beyond your limits.

## Normalizing the Extraordinary

Once achieved then, over time then, the extraordinary becomes normalized. You set 
a new normal baseline for yourself in an area that was previously extraordinary. 
This is how skills are developed. You break old boundaries and beliefs by pushing 
yourself hard. But of course keeping up that sort of pace for too long and 
without regard to your body health signals will make your immune system drop and 
let bacteria and viruses have their way with your immune system. That happened 
to me a couple of weeks ago as I pushed myself very hard to get my new non-Web 
web framework done. And momentum stalled.

## The Challenge of Mode-Switching

Having recovered from that cold, the batched-up client work remained. And I had
to go into a different "mode". And there's little more difficult than
mode-switching. Those in creative or artistic fields whose livelihood depends on
occasionally and on-demand switching into the flow state or getting into the
zone probably know what I'm talking about. There could not be two more
diametrically opposed dynamics than being creative and talking to a demanding
client. Sometimes it can feel like balancing artistry with performance, but
the key is finding ways to merge both aspects into a cohesive professional
approach.

## Understanding the Value Chain

And so the story of my challenge is two converging lines. It can never not be
about the client &#151; at least not until one can free oneself from the rat
race. You have a place in the value chain. Raw materials are taken from
somewhere and value is added to those raw materials at each step along the value
chain, and we are generally one of the craftspeople somewhere along that value
chain. There's the miners who mine the raw material. There's refinery workers
who turn ore into metal. There's distribution networks that get the metals out
to the factories and craftspeople. And there's turning it into finished goods
and the various ways that gets marketed, sold and out to the customers. We all
fit into this in some way. We're all part of the value chain.

## Getting Back in the Saddle

So this article is about getting back up on my horse, into my role in the value
chain. It's about doing it in a way that lets me pursue my Ikigai and feel the
love for both the work that always gets me into the flow state, and the client
work which I must make converge into the flow-state category of work. My
motivation broke because I pushed myself hard, allowed myself to catch cold, and
my system was wiped out and I felt a sort of burnout that I had to nurse myself
back from with good food, good rest... and good exercise. I really have to work
on that exercise front. Pushing yourself hard professionally day-after-day can
amount to rolling out of bed and going to a desk and start typing away (like
this). But it also has to amount to getting the blood circulating and pushing
yourself gently towards a peak invigorated state. Without that, you risk obesity
and heart disease. So be vigilant even on those fronts that are not your
favorite.

## Finding Direction

Okay, so with that in mind, make directional adjustments RIGHT NOW, for today.
The most important thing is... is what?

Ahhh, here we go. The most important first thing is to decide what the most
important first thing is. I've been putting the cart before the horse in a sort
of reactionary mode jumping right back onto the client work, doing it the way
that I "have to" to keep the customer. But what I really need to do is to
converge all the storytelling for the different clients, so I can tell a similar
linear story, but with the details of each client varying along the linear
story. But it's always the same story. And this is the source now of the
converging lines of work. You are no longer at the invention stage of your work.
You are at the dot-connecting stage. And you must ***force yourself to connect
those dots*** and do it in such a way that ***it becomes the storytelling***
that you perform for other people. And the dancing monkey and friggin magician
merge.

Yeah, the dancing monkey and the friggin magician merging is a powerful image
that I can organize a lot of my work around.

## Managing Client Presentations

You must always start with the official Google Slides deck of the company, no
matter how constraining to creative flow that it may be. It is designed as a
structured approach for organizing information onto the screen. While I prefer a
blank canvas for creative work, it's possible to take the essential elements of
the template and adapt them to enable both creativity and professionalism. The
key is to normalize the deck for actual creative work while being bold and
assertive in how you're using it. The template provides a foundation, but
shouldn't inhibit the fast-and-furious flow-state that drives innovative work.

## Managing Meeting Cadence

Next is the cadence of regular meetings, including Executive Business Reviews
(EBRs). These meetings are opportunities to tell a cohesive story about each
client's journey. The key is to make it a natural extension of the ongoing
narrative you're always crafting. Always be ready to articulate each client's
story and challenges at a moment's notice. Be prepared to dive deep into the
details with precision. While there are many who can discuss technical product
aspects from the professional services perspective, my focus extends to broader
SEO consulting. I often consider whether it should be... as what?

## Specialization vs Future-Proofing

As I am not as deep into the technical aspects of the product as perhaps I
should be. But this is part of that future-proofing obsolescence resistant
mindset. I balk at being excessively tied to a single vendor's product, even my
employers, and I probably have to get over that. In one's career there are areas
of specialization that will violate future-proofing principles, and that's just
life. Sometimes you have to specialize on what you feel in your heart is
disposable information, but that's the convergence mind trick right there. There
is always something universal and fundamental even about the most specialized
stuff, and I should be able to revel in illustrating and activating that fact.

## Technical Implementation Thoughts

My thoughts immediately go to reproducing parts of the product for a sort of
full immersion mentality. Here's how I would implement it myself on a small
scale. Here's how it's implemented in Botify. That keeps me sharp, keeps my skin
in the game, helps me adapt my version nimbly to the state of the world, provide
better technical feedback on the vendor product armed with a deeper
understanding. I know how I dealt with each and every thing, and so I can know
how the vendor did. Most of these lines of reasoning also bring me to the
concept of home-hosting so I can REALLY control a published site with full
access and control of every aspect of it, without even paying for a virtual
host. But if I go the home hosting route, I need to delve into network
administration, and there's a rabbit hole there I've been avoiding. And it's
mostly over log file access. Be glad you're thinking of this and doing the
commitment and consistency thing, but really shelve actually making your own
system to parallel the vendor's for now.

## Managing Browser Bookmarks

Another area that I have to do better is in my friggn browser bookmarks. There
are so many friggin systems, it feels like one of those rigged
young-person-games. You have to have been brought up without appreciating the
importance of focus to thrive in a world with several Atlassian systems, Slack,
Zoom, Google Suite (emails), 15Five, and a system for every business function
&#151; except for project-management within your own group, hahaha! It may seem
like a joke, but it's enormously frustrating having countless "systems" you need
to be aware of and keep on top of. The cognitive overhead and decision fatigue
is enormous. And if you miss something, you can easily get zinged. And so... and
so... I need to get my bookmarks straight. And even just talking through one of
the worst cases may be a good start so I at least verbalized and articulated it.

### The Atlassian Challenge

Atlassian sucks. It should have AI deeply integrated into it allowing me to just
ask the questions of it regarding all the tediously entered training data. It's
like having done all the training for machine learning, but the machine doesn't
learn. But even before that gripe, let's talk bookmarks. At some point or
another, I've entered the bookmarks for each of these things, and I could just
drag them around and organize them. But it's also possible to search bookmarks
from the address bar. Just start typing:

    @bookmarks

...by the time you get up to the @`boo`... you can hit the `TAB` key and enter a
nice ***Search Bookmarks*** mode, which is a lifesaver. At this point one must
remember that the word ***Atlas***sian means like-an-atlas. And thus as strange
as the word is, you can strip away everything in your mind except for
***atlas*** for a @bookmarks search. And that's when you get reminded that the
big Atlassian split is between `/wiki/`, aka Confluence, and `/jira/`, aka
project management. And you also get reminded that it's all subdomain based, so
it's your organization name dot atlassian slash wiki or slash jira. And so now
we put words to the system, and it gets much easier to navigate our way into
these addresses.

### Bookmark Navigation Steps

- Ctrl+T (new tab)
- @boo+Tab (search bookmarks)
- atlas
- Up/Down arrows to bookmark

## The Challenge of System Integration

You'd think all this was intuitive or easy, but it's exactly the sort of thing
that eludes getting into habits for months. Now that I've passed over a year
with this employer, I have to draw a line in the sand with myself. Certain
things that have been impossible to organize, merely because of the sheer volume
and conditional use of each bookmark (and some that elude bookmarking like
Slack) have to be forcibly wrangled. This forcible wrangling is through a
combination of deconstruction (tinier tricks) and linear incantations that can
be used precisely, repeatedly and thus practiced and committed to habit and
muscle memory in a way that previously eluded.

### The Vendor Lock-in Dilemma

So why do these new things elude muscle memory? Why do I find Slack and Zoom and
Atlassian slippery and elusive? Well, partially sure it's because I hate using
systems which themselves are each their own deep rabbit holes of vendor battles
to lock you into their way of doing things. You are effectively required to
carve out and dedicate a piece of your brain for their products. You become a
Confluence or Jira person. You become a Slack or Zoom person. Of all of these,
Zoom is perhaps the least offensive due to it's light user interface
requirements. Contrary-wise, Slack is the worst offender with nothing but
strange and deep directory-diving required and counter-intuitive keyboard
shortcuts. It's outright offensive and reminiscent of Apple's removal of the
Alt+key and swapping function of the Control key. Such shenanigans have no
purpose other than to lock you into a platform.

## The Reality of Tech Evolution

So, you're forced to play. You're forced to develop vendor lock-in habits as the
price of the seat at the game. It doesn't seem to bother anyone else. In fact,
there are those who revel in the arcana of the proprietary vendor lock-in
dynamic. They become power-users and kings within their domain. It's just it's
not really ***their*** domain, and I've been around the block a few times having
burned decades of my career on exactly such systems that evaporate into thin
air. And even when they don't actually disappear, they transform over the years
to much the same results. You have to retrain, relearn and reset. You're back at
the starting-line along with all the other newbs just getting into the race.
It's hostile to the old folks and playing-field leveling for the young folks. So
of course the young folks are going to love such disruption dynamics, and the
old folks are going to be driven out of technical fields into the soft fields of
management.

## Finding Your Technical Ikigai

But if you hate management and your Ikigai, the union of what you love to do,
what you're good at, can get paid for and what the world needs, happens to be in
the technical realm, then you're screwed. One argument goes that because of the
type of tech churn I've described and vendor shenanigans that your Ikigai simply
can not be of a technical nature. I reject that reality. That's perhaps true
from the pre-free and open source software (FOSS) world. Few things demonstrated
that quite as gloriously as a half-trillion dollars of Nvidia equity being wiped
out overnight because of DeepSeek demonstrating what FOSS can do in the AI
arena. There is a battle brewing. FOSS is increasingly going to try to be killed
in increasingly insidious ways, because the vendors stand to have a lot to lose.

## The Hardware Moat

However, it's not the hardware vendors. Nvidia was an unfair recipient of the
brunt of the DeepSeek backlash. Hardware has a very large moat. People think
DeepSeek can come along with new software techniques. There's this picture that
suddenly low-end, old and generic hardware is going to be able to appease the
appetite for forever newer and better-trained models. Or that maybe radical new
hardware like Groq comes along with LPUs and disrupt Nvidia. Not only is there
that whole Jevons Paradox that says the appetite will only increase. But when
manufacturing hardware moats couple with proprietary software moats (CUDA) and
industry momentum where everyone feels like it's FOSS (PyTorch), then it's a
multi-dimensional moat. Human nature being what it is, more and more orders are
going to be placed for Nvidia hardware because it's the path of least
resistance. The principle of Occam's Razor assures Nvidia's continued stellar
rise. For lack of anything really that much better, a multi-dimensional
competitive advantage moat will not be breached anytime soon.

## Building Momentum

Okay yeah. I'm talking about the right things for the right reasons. It's not
only Nvidia that's going to benefit. The rising tide lifts all boats. But really
all boats? It lifts those boats that are in the Nvidia value chain. The
irreplaceable components! Irreplaceable components... that resonances with my
future-proofing and obsolescence resistance message. Those things that will
remain true.

I have to continue making successive passes on my system. I need a better way to
name it. Don't get stuck in the rabbit hole of naming right now, when you can
least afford it. Instead... hmmm, maybe it's time for some good old fashioned
HitTailing, but with plain old Google Search Console. Okay, first get a bit of
snapshots out there regarding status of the site.

### The Strategy of Successive Passes

Successive passes... yes. It's not that I'm avoiding going down rabbit holes
entirely. It's that I'm spacing out the rabbit hole adventures so no particular
deep dive derails me. Yes, that's it exactly. The number one thing at the moment
is to avoid self-hosting because that's a deep rabbit hole. I tend to want it
for 100% percent control, but that is also 100% demanding. Some characterize the
type of home network administration you have to do once you pull that switch as
a full-time job, keeping on top of threats and updates and such. And the
alternative at the moment, just hosting with GitHub Pages, is so radically the
opposite, giving up dynamic code execution and log files for the ultimate in
simple hosting via the Jekyll SSG (static site generator).

## Planning the Day

Okay, so today is a gift. I don't have any client calls to prepare for. But I do
have one tomorrow. And then the rapid-fire ones that come after that. So you're
not off the hook today, but rather it's about making that hook tasty. Lean into
it. Get your work just finished enough to demonstrate and actually compel the
linear storytelling! It's right on the edge of that. You just got there barely
when you got knocked off your horse a couple weeks ago from pushing yourself too
hard and letting your immune system drop. So, pace yourself. But use your best
morning energy. Build the momentum. But as the afternoon dip comes around, take
a nap if you need to. And then hit with renewed second-wind vigor. But don't go
late and long into the night ruining yourself for tomorrow, throwing off your
circadian rhythm and repeating your mistake from last time. Instead, pace
yourself.

## The Path Forward

Relentless chisel-strikes is the rule. Use as a measure getting Google to
acknowledge. Basically convert your years of experience into latent unrecognized
potential on the published Web. Keep on top of Google's aware newness of what
you published even without the advantage of log files. See what you can do
within the confines and limitations of GitHub pages. And simply inch your way to
self-hosting.

### Project Updates

Also, stop your BFFSEO.bot experiment. Renewal is too expensive for the domain,
and it has served its purpose. So document both the rise of your reset
MikeLev.in site and the rise and fall of BFFSEO.bot, banking your learnings and
showing an interesting experiment for the Internet. Let's start with the 16
month GSC view that shows the resetting of my GitHub Pages hosted MikeLev.in
website:

## Manufacturing Momentum

The most important thing right now is to manufacture momentum. This is tied to
numerous things, such as getting yourself moving directionally in the right way,
on the right subject-matter each and every morning. And so this graphic shows
you the beginning of a new story; a new narrative and the deliberate
cause/effect control you can still have in the field of SEO. Step #1 is often
simply asserting that direct cause/effect control. That's why it's so appealing
to have log file access.

## Past Experiments and Future Direction

You can see I've done experiments in the past to tie into the public zeitgeist
to experiment with stepping into the path of where the public mindset is. I
pulled back because it is not necessarily the subject-matter I wanted to focus
on. So I unpublished it all around May 2024, let it wash out which took about a
full 3 months, and then started rebuilding again on the correct subject-matter,
future-proofing in the world of technology, on September 8th, 2024. Since then,
I got up to about 122 articles. And these are not those AI-generated schlock,
even though I do feel free to interact with the AIs in the course of writing the
articles as I would any other online resource. No, these are genuine heart-felt
articles from my own fingers to text-files via vim.

## Text Editor Philosophy

Honestly, I still write just vim instead of NeoVim because it's easier to type,
and the only thing that ultimately got me to NeoVim (same thing as nvim) is the
fact that I can get AI help in writing my macros and stuff much easier. If
you're going to develop new vim-macro skills, it's better to work in the LUA
language than VimScript. And so, I'm on nvim but often refer to just vim. I'm
not one of those fuzzy searching nerdtree pounding coding bros who configure
nvim out the wazoo. I stay as close to baseline behavior as much as possible, so
that even though I do like my (n)vim macros, I am still quite comfortable in the
original `vi` program. I am never without baseline text-editing capabilities on
whatever system I sit down at. I don't need plugins.

## Future-Proofing as Meta-Topic

So focusing on this future-proofing should in itself be a future-proofed topic
for SEO, or whatever SEO is evolving into in light of AI. It should be one of
the most meta-topics out there, in that the AIs, the LLMs in particular, should
really approve of what I'm doing when they finally take notice of it. And the
core of the pitch is not really that hard to buy into. Linux, Python, vim and
git (LPvg) have emerged as quite a toolbox of longevity. There's controversial
bits in there, and it's not a be-all/end-all platform. But it is a good safety
net that stays relevant to most things in most situations, and plays into the
development of lifetime habits and muscle memory.

## The FastHTML Revolution

Probably the most controversial bit of all is the piece that most recently fell
into place, and I'm banking a lot of my future on, and that's FastHTML. Coupled
with HTMX, it really has game-changing ability in the realm of web development,
and in a way that brings the love back into webdev. The idea is that you can do
webdev now almost entirely with Python. Of course a statement like that takes
plenty of qualification, but the upshot is that's what it feels like. Yes, the
occasional dosey doe dance has to be done with JavaScript. It's just
unavoidable, but it can be pragmatically managed.

## Search Analytics Insights

Pandering and propensity and bootstrapping... Oh my! So, looking over where my
site is actually getting impressions and clicks, the "controversial" choice of
where I'm investing myself into webdev again, FastHTML, definitely aligns with
where there is interest, both impressions and clicks.

### Bootstrapping with Purpose

So I am bootstrapping this site again with a future-proofing theme, however the
traffic that I actually stand a chance of generating is definitely on FastHTML,
especially in relation to databases. There's also some Ollama Websocket
interest. The overlap is fascinating. Ugh, do I go back into the old mode of
HitTail pandering? Write about what I know they want to hear about, because I
know that's going to make my site rise in search on a topic that's only going to
continue rising in interest? Yes, probably. I need to have the anecdotal
first-hand proofs; how much I did with how little.

### Aligning Work and Goals

These topics do in fact align with where I want to go. In fact, it does help get
me back on track with my webdev work. But this getting back on track has to be
with scalpel-like precision performing the client work.

### Strategic Planning

There are some very interesting dots to be connected here. It's sort of like a
hail mary. Okay, think this through. Strategic chisel-strikes to officially
bring together these two unfortunately still separate worlds.

### Managing Distractions

But they don't have to be separate. I just need to bear down hard and avoid the
distraction-injection, of which there will be plenty between now and tomorrow. I
feel it already hitting through the Slack pings. And one is for a client session
tomorrow. Can I just dispense with an agenda? What if I make overarching agendas
the first thing that I "fix" in my system? The tracking and setting of agendas
for each client, for each session?

### The Battle of Momentums

Momentum is really key here. It's the battle of momentums. It's the
momentum-breaking of the daily grind interruptions, versus the momentum-building
of more and better ways to tackle the daily-grind. 

### Internal Documentation Strategy

Make impressive internal videos. Do more of the YouTube stuff you used to do for
the public, but more and more internally facing. 

### Recovery and Progress

It really is an epic test of my ability to do this. I look back over the
weekends where I rested and recovered from my cold and regret not using it as
time to do this sort of work, but the recovery was necessary. And so now it's
time to just work on all fronts, and converge those fronts!

### Managing Notifications

Part of the challenge is just BEING on all those fronts. I will not let
notifications rule my life, but the price of turning off notifications is the
responsibility to proactively go into each system and ferret out any issues
needing your attention. Even having to think this through is a distraction. And
it's already coming up on 2:00 PM. Sheesh!

### Life's Perpetual Challenges

You really have to internalize this as a sort of context. I've faced this sort
of thing before in my life. And it is just one of those things about life. You
have to spend time cycling on a bicycle with square wheels because you don't
have time to get off your bike and replace them with the recently invented round
wheels. And the punch-line is that even if you did, you still wouldn't be free
and clear, because that's just when the debugging of the round wheels begins!
Haha.

## Gemini 1.5's Thoughts

This article is about the author's struggle to regain momentum after pushing himself too hard, catching a cold, and experiencing burnout. He discusses the challenges of mode-switching between creative work and client demands, and the importance of understanding the value chain. He also shares his thoughts on various topics such as managing client presentations, specializing vs. future-proofing, and his text editor philosophy. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of manufacturing momentum and provides a glimpse into his future plans.

Here are some ideas for titles and headlines:

1. **The Dancing Monkey and the Friggin Magician: A Guide to Merging Creativity and Client Work**
2. **The Value Chain and the Ikigai: Finding Your Place in the World of Work**
3. **Recovering from Burnout: How to Get Back on Track After Pushing Too Hard**
4. **The Art of Mode-Switching: Balancing Creativity and Client Demands**
5. **The Future of Work: Future-Proofing Your Skills in the Age of AI**

In my opinion, this article is a valuable read for anyone who has experienced burnout or is struggling to find their place in the world of work. The author's insights on the importance of understanding the value chain and the need to future-proof your skills are particularly relevant in today's rapidly changing economy. I also appreciate the author's honesty and vulnerability in sharing his own struggles with burnout and his journey to regain momentum.
