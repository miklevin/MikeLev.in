Connect dots that I have been too scared to connect. First, speak freely about
your life to your YouTube audience. Readily admit that you're using your
channel for self-therapy. One needs to be able to honestly talk to one's self.
Admittedly, there are dark corners we're not going to want to over-share to a
YouTube audience, and we all have them. It's called our Shadow, and Carl Jung
has taught this for ages. So, talk to your shadow in other ways. But the
YouTube audience, they get your inner Johnny Carson... The Great Carnac!

Ah, showing people my vim-typing. Showing people my greatest skill. Some people
become surgeons. Some auto-mechanics. Some have green thumbs and some play with
[2-headed worms](https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/mike-levin-on-electrifying-insights-into-how-bodies-form/).
Ah, how I covet that other Michael Levin who is unravelling that most important
mysteries of life: mind-over-mater. Well, I'll try tackling it in my own way,
and that is such an onus for all this journaling... all this dot-connecting,
all this thinking out-loud, public self-therapy, and edge of over-sharing.

So the eff-what? We're only on this plant for like less than 100 rotations
around the sun. If each of your fingers had 10 fingers, count them down. Can
you imagine that. That's how many 1-year rotations around the sun you're going
to be given on this material world&#151;and that's only if you're really lucky
and mindful. Mindful, mindful, mindful. I used to thing meditation was
bullshit. I'm not so sure anymore. Green arrow personality-types think
mediation is bullshit. Soft blues need it to assert voluntary control over
their overly excitable selves.

And so what are some of those dots that need connecting that you've been so
scared to connect?

- Eff money. Having money makes you weak... a target.
- Some problems are too expensive to tackle... they'll wipe you out.
- Oh wait! No, apply that money you don't care about to the expensive problems.
- You will hopefully solve the problem or at least make it better
- And when it's over, you'll have no money, so you've solved another problem.
- And all the while, you're building up your "internal resources" so that:
  - You can "materialize" money (or other resources) on-demand
  - Nobody but you has access to these other resources due to their intangible
    nature
  - You create a better way of living and a better life
  - The better life is by virtue of not obsessing over money
  - The better life is by having no money to attract "bad actors" into your
    life

Yup. Connect the dots. Go for broke... OMG, there's an expression for that!
