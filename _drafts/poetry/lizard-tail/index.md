# The Lizard Tail Task

There's a tale I'd like to tell you Of Lizard whose tail had value! This lizard was for all intents Upstanding and the best of gents.

He worked with mice to earn his keep By shucking corn and shearing sheep. But by far, his skill was wielding Tons and tons of work unyielding.

His boss, the bird, the yellow tail Was often heard to scream and wail "The work is of the urgent sort!" But Lizard knew not to retort.

From years of this, he would avail To load much work upon his tail. That work on tail made bird-boss sing But in the end, meant not a thing.

When times got tough and things got grim Guess who was to lose a limb? But lizards, you know, have a knack To lose a tail and grow it back!

While Lizard's good for a new day Guess who got stuffed and on display? Replaced by frogs who promptly ask Lizard for a lizard-tail-task.

The moral is that when you deem A thing to be a bird-brained scheme But you must do it, put it where When it does fail, you will not care!
