# Eighty Twenty Rule

The 80/20 friggn' rule -- Gotta' use it. It's a tool Reducing clutter that we pack Into our lives to hold us back.

When goals elude and time flies past And with each step, you're still in last Consider how you lost your aim You'll find recursive tasks to blame.

With each thing you set to do, A hundred more come fly at you. Until at last, you quite forget The goal for which you had first set.

The 80/20 Rule just asks That you should start to plan your tasks So when you're only one-fifth done You could have stopped and still have won.
