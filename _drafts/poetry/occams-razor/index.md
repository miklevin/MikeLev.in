# Occam’s Razor

There is a trait in us, innate, To twist and complicate The work at-hand to be too grand; In effort -- far too great.

But the measure of endeavor That the wise do tend to favor Is to see how things do cut up Underneath of Occam's Razor!

When things evolve you must resolve -- You will do well to recall The simple answer is the best With all else being equal.
