# The Ghost Ball

There's a ball that's a tool, which is used well in pool, Though it's really not known well as most. This ball tends to show where the others will go. It's the ball that is known as the Ghost.

When inline with a ball so as aimed at a hole Then the Ghost Ball will give you a clue Of where you should plink it so that you can sink it Dispelling the Ghost with the Que.

It evens the odds, makes players of clods, Removing from them any doubt. For someone who sees, it makes pool a breeze. Ghost Balls can be found all about.
