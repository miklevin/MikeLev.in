# Who Let in The Bees?

    If A's hire A's and B's hire C's, 
    The question at hand's: "Who let in the B's?" 
    The B's will take over -- they're killers, you see! 
    "Aye!" shout the A's. "We can't let it be!"

    But the damage is done -- the B's have a hive. 
    All's left is to run -- while the place takes a dive. 
    "No!" cry the A's. "Our dreams are in there!" 
    "Oh?" say the B's. "Show us just where."

    There, the A's falter, for B's have a knack 
    To swarm like a bastard and drive the A's back. 
    B's win in the end -- as every A sees... 
    At root is the problem: some A's let in B's.
