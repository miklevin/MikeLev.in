By the far-reaching inwoods, at the gardens of goo Lives Slammy The Lieboy and Shovey Meetoo. With nothing but time, and a wee-bit insane They sit and they brood about what to complain!

"Let's torture the neighbors," said Shovey: "I'll shove The gent I resent, 'cause their house full of love Insults and offends all that I stand for. Let's tell dirty lies about fumes from their door!"

"I love it!" Said Lieboy, "Now hurry, let's call On every Board Bully, to break every law." And so they attempted the great garden hit But failed to consider how you see through that shit.

Said Has-a-Brain Johnny: "I won't go along With all of your lies," to the Lieboy: "So long! Your poisonous tongue won't get my ass fired. This torture must end, and your pastime retired!"

So Slammy would slam, and then Shovey would shove; With every peace offering, they'd feast on the dove, As Board Bullies cheered-on at such a disgrace. But that's how it swings at the goo garden place.
