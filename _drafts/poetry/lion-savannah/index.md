# Lion on The Savannah

Lyin' out on the Savannah -- Like a Buddha in Nirvana, From a nap that I am takin' Comes a scent, and I awaken!

In no time at all, I'm certain There is Zebra -- out there herdin'. Silent as before they woke us, Out, I crept intent and focussed.

Out to them I glide, unbidden In the grass that keeps us hidden. Now, I have them in my vision, Blind, they are as to my mission.

This, I'm made for! No denyin' With my nature -- I'm allyin'! Not one moment am I sorry When I pounce upon my quarry...

But on the brink I do delay -- I feel more like Warthog today! If to you this does seem bogus, Think on it when YOU lose focus.
