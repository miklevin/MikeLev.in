# Success Poem

Success lives in Method -- by Detail and Knowledge, Near Foresight and Know-How. Some find him through College.

With him live Passion, The-Peak-of-Your-Game, Thoughtful-Endeavor, and Purposeful-Aim.

Together they play -- their games long-and-late Preparing in ways that their names indicate.

They fashion their plans -- revising them new, Testing to litmus what is best to do,

...Always assessing conditions abroad, Insisting decisions be sound and be bold.

They play as a team, know each at the table, Make clear expectations, play each-as-is-able.

The aim of the game is to turn what they know Into meaningful action; to make fortune flow.

Together they play -- long into the night. Earning the names they use in the light.
