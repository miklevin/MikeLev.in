# Ding In The Universe

My mission is modest My purpose is clear It's doing great stuff So you'll know I was here.

I am not a giant Who's moving great boulders, But rather, I'm happy To stand on their shoulders

Sharpening tools That I wield in my labor Folding and honing A nano-sharp saber

Which I whip out When I rise to theÂ threat Of obsolescence; I'm not dead yet.
