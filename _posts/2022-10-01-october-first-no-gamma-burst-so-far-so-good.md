Wow, it's October 1st! Time flies. I'm only just starting to be settled into
the new place after the move from the Poconos mountains in Pennsylvania back in
July 2022 to the friggn island again in New York City. Doesn't even feel like
NYC. Don't get any of the benefits of NYC. I just have to pay that much higher
of living expenses, PLUS other surprise ongoing expenses. I'm going to have to
do something about that sooner or later. The sooner the better. Frig. Okay,
enough of that stuff. Focus on the positive and visualize the even more
positive. We are actualizing machines, we privileged sentient conscious beings.
We overcome the dissolution of things. We make the chemical reactions of the
Universe as interesting as possible during this particular oscillation we find
ourselves in, between what we call the Big Bang and whatever comes next, which
I feel is much up to what the life does with its turn during the oscillation.
Why not type 4, 5 or 6 on the Kardashev scale? The center cannot hold says
Yates. I say why can't it? Step 1: survive filter events. Check! Step 3:
prosper, hang with God or whatnot. Could be a lot of things. Any way you look
at it, it's probably better than getting fried in the next local gamma burst.
