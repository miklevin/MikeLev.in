Surprise! I just moved all the blog posts I've been doing on whatsametafor.io
(for lack of a better site) over to MikeLev.in, which is a better site. It has
quite a bit of history built up and is where I migrated my old HostMonster
WordPress site over to, under Github.io (now Github Pages). But because of how
that migrated wordpress blog (now markdown files) sat in the folder, it was
difficult to blend in my new system.

But that was really only a matter of taking the time to sort things out. I'm
slowly learning Jekyll. I also looked at Hyde and Hugo. But honestly, even
though Jekyll is based on Ruby which doesn't thrill me, it's so tied to Github
and widely supported and too big to fail (or stall-out like Hyde) that it'd be
silly to switch. And since it's all just driven by markdown files which are
just plain text files, I could always switch from static-site-generator to
static-site-generator (SSG) with just a easy transform script. I think all I'd
have to do is alter the template system and frontmatter.

Jekyll's template system is called Liquid. It's not the most mainstream one in
the world, but it's not so different from the popular Django-like
double-curly-bracket stuff that it would be hard to transform. I'm sure there's
existing packages that do it. So I'm not going to sweat it. Forge on ahead,
learning the Liquid templating system to assert some control over my sites.
