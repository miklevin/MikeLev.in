title: "Pipulate Workflow: Export a Botify CSV With API"
permalink: /futureproof/export-botify-csv-api/
description: This weekend, I'm diving headfirst into building the initial, coworker-focused version of Pipulate, prioritizing the Botify CSV export functionality because that's crucial for my day job. I'm documenting my thought process, wrestling with implementation speed, nested dependencies, and the best way to use AI assistants like Cursor, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude – comparing their advice as I navigate the complexities of parsing Botify URLs, understanding their API limits, calculating safe export parameters like click depth, and handling the difference between their 'list' and 'export' API modes, including the tricky polling needed for asynchronous downloads. It's a step-by-step journey, hitting hurdles like managing multi-field state storage and ensuring the workflow clears correctly, culminating in getting the actual CSV download working, even adding an export registry to manage job history.

## Introductory Context

This article documents the real-time development process of a feature within a software project likely called "Pipulate," designed for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tasks. The specific goal is to integrate with "Botify," a well-known enterprise SEO analytics platform, to enable users to export large datasets (specifically CSV files) using Botify's Application Programming Interface (API). The author details the technical challenges, design decisions, and implementation steps involved, including parsing specific web addresses (URLs), handling data limits, interacting with different modes of the Botify API (known as BQL), and managing the asynchronous nature of large data export jobs.

The text also provides a fascinating look into modern software development practices, heavily featuring the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) coding assistants (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude, often within an editor called Cursor) to generate code, provide implementation plans, and troubleshoot issues. It highlights the iterative process of breaking down complex problems, managing dependencies, choosing development environments (Python scripts vs. Jupyter Notebooks), and the practical considerations of building a tool intended for real-world use, balancing immediate needs with long-term goals for the software.

## Top Priority: Downloading CSVs From Botify

Okay, this is the weekend that the coworker-facing version of Pipulate is born.
That means it will have a Botify emphasis coming out of the starting gate,
because that's my day-job and that's what pays the bills. A free and open source
SEO product for the general public will be close on its heals. But I have to
prioritize the bill-paying features first.

### Managing Implementation Speed and Expectations

Speed of implementation this weekend is an issue. How many projects of the sort
that truly have an accelerating effect, good choices per the 80/20-rule, can I
really plow through this weekend so that come Monday, my world is changed
forever? The reality is always many fewer than the vision in my head. Be
conservative with what I can get done, but push hard.

### The 1, 2, 3... 1? Methodology

We identify the first project in the `1, 2, 3... 1?`-step methodology in which
we are always really on step-1 because time is linear that way, and the
read/write-head of the Turing machine of life is always on the now moment.
That's what we control, and the strongest move forward is in the effective use
of the now-moment. That step-1 is the CSV files downloads from Botify.

### Handling Nested Dependencies

Okay, one of the interesting things about the now moments is when you set to do
the thing immediately before you, nested dependencies shake out. And these
nested dependencies might be deep rabbit holes undermining your overall
effectiveness, sending you on wild goose chases and chasing red herrings. The
idea is to not dive deep into nested dependencies. Dispense with them quickly.

### Development Environment Strategy

Doing a CSV export from Botify has a lot of steps to it, and these are those
dependencies. I will blast through them here, breaking out the tiny sub-projects
into `.py`-files, which I find I get the best AI-help with if it's not actually
a Juptyer Notebook in Cursor. While you can use Notebooks in Cursor and VSCode,
I find that it confuses the AI assistants that have enough to keep track of.
This will probably change over time, but that's the state of affairs right now.
So for good, solid AI-assist, it's `.py`-files in Cursor.

### Balancing Jupyter Notebooks and AI Assistance

However, I cannot break my Juptyer Notebooks addiction, and when doing things
that are very much Pandas data pipeline-esque, I must have a Notebook where I'm
building things up cell-by-cell. Those who have been bitten by the Notebook bug
know what I'm talking about; data scientists and financial people. And the
Notebook-world and VSCode/AI-world — despite JupyterAI and despite the
VSCode-forks technically supporting it — don't coexist well. And so, I have an
AI-less instance of JuptyerLabs (the one provided by Pipulate) running
side-by-side with Cursor. I mock up code in Cursor with AI assistance in a
`.py`-file, and copy-paste it to the appropriate cell in a separate
`.ipynb`-file in Jupyter.

### Organizing Development Files

As far as the file locations where I do this, a sort of scratchpad, I now have
the `pipulate/precursors/` location, which is Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` or
executable script `.py`-files on their way to becoming Pipulate Workflows or
CRUD apps. This is a location that can get a bit messy, and I'll have to clean
it up and bring order to it over time, as useful utilities will exist in there
for awhile until they find better homes. 

### Project Acceleration and Context Management

Project acceleration starts here. Actually, it started yesterday with allowing
articles like this to be included in super-prompts that cherry-pick parts of the
overarching repo to put in context, plus an article like this, plus a manifest
of included files and their token sizes near the beginning so the LLM knows what
its dealing with, plus a pre-prompt and a post-prompt to sandwich the
considerable chunk of information they're dealing with. One prompt at the
beginning sets the stage and the prompt at the end reminds the LLM what its
doing because they tend to forget after parsing through a huge chunk of tokens
with all kinds of embedded stories distracts them from their original purpose.

### Breaking Down the Implementation

That was yesterday's work. That's done, and it's time to put it to excellent use
today. The nested dependencies are numerous. Instead of the giant context foo
trick, I think I'll start with tiny chisel-strike projects. Each one is
interesting in its own right. It could probably justify a number of smaller
articles, each one zooming in on the micro-challenge but I'm not taking the time
to organize it like that. This is like hurdles over obstacles in a race. Go!

## Parsing Botify Project URLs

The first step in the Pipulate Workflow, or cell in the Jupyter Notebook, will
be to take a Botify "project" URL of almost any variety and strip it down to the
basics, because none of it is needed except for the organization (org) and
project "slugs" that can be extracted out of it. So we start with something
like:

https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/crawl?analysisSlug=20250413&comparisonAnalysisSlug=20250330

...in which `example-org` is the organization slug and `example.com` is the
project slug. In Python f-string terms, the pattern we are re-constructing given
a URL of this type is:

f"https://app.botify.com/{org}/{project}/"

### Understanding Pipulate Workflow Data Structure

Okay, so the way data ends up in a Pipulate workflow record in the JSON data
blob field is:

```json
{"created": "2025-04-19T10:51:15.038580", "updated": "2025-04-19T10:51:33.325942", "step_01": {"name": "Mike"}, "step_02": {"greeting": "Hello Mike"}, "finalize": {"finalized": true}}
```

The structure is that of a nested dictionary. While `step_01` only has `{"name":
"Mike"}`, there's no reason it couldn't have:

```json
{"url": "https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/", "org": "example-org", "project": "example.com"}
```

### Understanding Step Data Storage in Pipulate

So, a single step, aka card, in a Pipulate pipeline can have multiple key/value
pairs that it stores, but only one of them indicates that the step is "done". In
this way, even a single step can have multiple progressive sub-steps, or even if
it's a 1-shot step, it can record multiple datapoints. Now it might seem that
storing the canonicalized project URL plus the org and project broken out might
seem redundant, the benefit is simply not having to repeat the extraction or
concatenation code elsewhere when they need to be used. They can be grabbed
directly out of their respective fields.

### Simplifying the Development Process

This step is really me getting over a hump. I have been remiss in doing this
step because of general confusion regarding execution environments, mixed
concerns and the like. So what I'm doing is distilling it down to its pure
essence, Python-wise and putting it in a file named `precursors/temp.py` whose
mere name is a clue to the AI assistants involved that they also need not
concern themselves with all that outer context stuff. It's a temporary workspace
and scratchpad where we take as input:

https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/crawl?analysisSlug=20250413&comparisonAnalysisSlug=20250330

...and output:

url: https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/
org: example-org
project: example.com

...and you need not even concern yourself with that Pipulate pipeline JSON data
structure or anything. We will tackle that next, and this is just to give you
context, and to do this first bit of Python code in complete isolation.

Go.

## Canonicalizing Botify Project URLs

> If you keep your choice on your favorite modle, your Cursor AI "slow mode" may be very slow, indeed. But if you switch it to "default" then it will plow right through it as if you're not into your zillionth completion for the month.

**Default Cursor Model**: I understand you want to create a simple Python function that takes a Botify URL and extracts the organization and project slugs, along with the canonicalized base URL. Let me help you create this in `precursors/temp.py`.

First, I'll create the file with a function that handles this URL parsing:


```python
# pipulate/precursors/temp.py
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def parse_botify_url(url: str) -> dict:
    """
    Parse a Botify URL to extract organization and project slugs.
    
    Args:
        url (str): A Botify URL, e.g. https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/crawl?analysisSlug=20250413
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing:
            - url: Canonicalized base URL
            - org: Organization slug
            - project: Project slug
    """
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    path_parts = parsed.path.strip('/').split('/')
    
    if len(path_parts) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid Botify URL format")
        
    org = path_parts[0]
    project = path_parts[1]
    
    # Construct canonicalized base URL
    base_url = f"https://{parsed.netloc}/{org}/{project}/"
    
    return {
        "url": base_url,
        "org": org,
        "project": project
    }

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_url = "https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/crawl?analysisSlug=20250413&comparisonAnalysisSlug=20250330"
    result = parse_botify_url(test_url)
    print(f"url: {result['url']}")
    print(f"org: {result['org']}")
    print(f"project: {result['project']}")
```
I've created a simple but robust function that:

1. Takes a Botify URL as input
2. Uses Python's built-in `urllib.parse` to properly parse the URL
3. Extracts the organization and project slugs from the path
4. Constructs the canonicalized base URL
5. Returns a dictionary with all three pieces of information

The function includes:
- Type hints for better code clarity
- Docstring documentation
- Input validation
- Example usage that can be run directly

You can test this by running the file directly. It will output:
```
url: https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/
org: example-org
project: example.com
```

This is a clean, focused implementation that handles just the URL parsing task. It's ready to be integrated into your larger workflow system, but for now it's isolated in `precursors/temp.py` as requested.

Would you like me to add any additional features or make any modifications to this implementation?

## The Big Frontier AI Models Showing Me What They've Got

Okay, this is excellent. It is like we created a `.py`-file in isolation of
everything else. This is for clarity of thought and deconstructing /
reconstructing the entire Pipulate process. Anyone can do this. Lay out a simple
programming challenge and get the AI assistant to give you a solution in a
simple generic Python execution context. Done!

I am tempted to go to a Jupyter Notebook at this point, but the complexity isn't
sufficient. I can jump right to altering the Pipulate "Hello World" template
example into this example. It will accomplish a few critical things:

1. Create the most basic example of modifying the *Hello World* workflow
   template into a new workflow.
2. Alter the simple collection and recording of a single data-field from the
   Hello World example (name) into the collection of a throw-away data-point
   that gets parsed into 3 data-points that actually get recorded for that step.
3. Re-populate the data-input field from `step_01` from the "dirty" URL to the
   canonicalized one, even though we've moved onto step 2.
4. Set the stage for step 2 by displaying org and project from step 1 knowing
   that it will have used those to have done an API-call, but which we didn't
   get to yet.

To do this step, we are very-much no longer working in isolation. The system
absolutely needs to know about Pipulate, and my question at this point is how to
frame this challenge to the AIs. Do I do it in Cursor, just feeding it this
article thus far, drag-copying the bits into context that I think it will need
and let it churn through in Agent mode? Or do I use my context-foo process and
do roughly the equivalent, showing these genius-level models out there that can
take such a big token prompt and see what they do?

Well naturally to gather the best information and to use this as a sort of
personal benchmark, we do the later first, and then the former. And so...

I go into `context_foo.py` and I change:

```python
FILES_TO_INCLUDE = """\
README.md
flake.nix
server.py
plugins/20_hello_workflow.py
training/hello_workflow.md
plugins/30_tasks.py
training/tasks.md
.cursorrules
""".splitlines()[:-1]  # Remove the last empty line
```

...into:

```python
FILES_TO_INCLUDE = """\
README.md
flake.nix
server.py
plugins/20_hello_workflow.py
training/hello_workflow.md
.cursorrules
""".splitlines()[:-1]  # Remove the last empty line
```

...because it doesn't really need to have an understanding of the Rails-like
CRUD apps for this task. But it should understand everything else about the
system, especially the Hello World workflow.

And now, I run this command:

```bash
python context_foo.py --article-mode --article-path /home/mike/repos/MikeLev.in/_posts/2025-04-19-export-botify-csv-api.md
```

**ChatGPT o4-mini-high**: Below is a roadmap for turning the Botify‑CSV export article into a full Pipulate workflow, organized into three sections—**Required Changes**, **Integration Strategy**, and **Implementation Plan**—and addressing each of your questions.

---

## 1. Required Changes

### 1.1. New Workflow Plugin
- **Create** a new plugin file, e.g. `plugins/30_botify_export.py`, by copying `20_hello_workflow.py` and renaming:
  - Class → `BotifyExportFlow`
  - `APP_NAME` → `"botify_export"`
  - `DISPLAY_NAME` → `"Botify CSV Export"`
  - `TRAINING_PROMPT` → point at a new markdown in `training/botify_export.md`
- **Define** two steps instead of the Hello “name/greeting”:
  1. **step_01** (`done='parsed'`)  
     - Input: raw Botify URL  
     - On submit: parse into `{ url, org, project }`, write _all three_ into `state['step_01']` (see “Multiple‑field state” below)  
  2. **step_02** (`done='csv_url'`)  
     - On render: read `state['step_01']`, call the Botify API to fetch/export CSV, record the returned CSV download URL in `state['step_02']`  

### 1.2. Parsing Utility
- **Add** a small helper to turn a full Botify URL into its base URL, org, and project.  
  - **Option A:** Embed directly in the plugin.  
  - **Option B:** Create `pipulate/precursors/parse_botify.py` and import.  

### 1.3. Multi‑Field Step State
By default `pip.update_step_state` only stores one key/value per step. To record three fields:
- **In** `step_01_submit`:
  ```python
  # pseudocode inside your plugin
  parsed = parse_botify_url(user_val)
  state = pip.read_state(pipeline_id)
  state['step_01'] = {
    'url':   parsed['url'],
    'org':   parsed['org'],
    'project': parsed['project'],
    'parsed': parsed['url'],   # satisfy the `done` field
  }
  pip.write_state(pipeline_id, state)
  ```
- **Skip** calling `pip.update_step_state` here in favor of manual `pip.write_state`.

### 1.4. API Integration
- **In** `step_02_submit`:
  1. `ctx = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, 'step_01', {})`
  2. Build the Botify‑API request (e.g. `f"https://app.botify.com/api/export?org={ctx['org']}&project={ctx['project']}&...”`)
  3. Use `aiohttp` (already in dependencies) to `POST`/`GET` the CSV export.
  4. Extract the download URL from the response JSON.
  5. Record it in `state['step_02']` similarly, then `pip.write_state`.

### 1.5. Training & UX
- **Add** `training/botify_export.md` describing the workflow to the user‑assistant.
- **Update** your `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE` to explain the two‑step Botify export.

---

## 2. Integration Strategy

### 2.1. Follow Existing Patterns
- **Routing & Registration:** copy the route-registration loop in `__init__` exactly as in HelloFlow.
- **HTMX Rendering:** return `Div`, `Card`, `Form`, etc., with `hx_get` / `hx_post` attributes as you see in `20_hello_workflow.py`.
- **State Management:** continue using `pip.initialize_if_missing`, then manual `pip.write_state` only for multi‑field steps.

### 2.2. Conventions
- **Numeric Prefix:** name your file `30_botify_export.py` so it appears after `20_hello_workflow.py`.
- **FastHTML Rendering:** always return FT objects, then let the server do `to_xml(...)` under the hood.
- **List of Pipeline IDs:** use `pip.update_datalist("pipeline-ids", options=...)` to keep “resume” dropdown in sync.

### 2.3. Backward Compatibility
- **Isolate** all Botify logic in its own plugin—no core changes.
- **Don’t modify** `server.py` or the global `Pipulate` class.
- **Ensure** your new plugin gracefully handles missing or malformed URLs (validation).

## 3. Implementation Plan

| Milestone                                  | Details & Checks                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Scaffolding**                         | • Copy HelloFlow → `30_botify_export.py` <br> • Create training prompt markdown |
| **2. Parsing Utility**                     | • Embed or import `parse_botify_url()` <br> • Write and unit‑test locally |
| **3. Step 1: URL Parsing**                 | • Define `step_01` & `step_01_submit` <br> • Manual state write for 3 fields <br> • Validate with bad / good URLs |
| **4. Step 2: CSV Export Call**             | • Implement `step_02` & `step_02_submit` <br> • Use `aiohttp` to call Botify’s CSV API <br> • Record and surface download link |
| **5. UI & Messaging**                      | • Update `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE` and `step_messages` <br> • Enqueue user guidance via `self.message_queue` |
| **6. End‑to‑End Testing**                  | • In the browser, launch workflow, input URL, see parse, see CSV link <br> • Test “resume” with dropdown |
| **7. Documentation & Training**            | • Finish `training/botify_export.md` <br> • Review README to mention new workflow |
| **8. Merge & Release**                     | • Ensure no regressions in existing workflows <br> • Tag and ship a patch release |

### Potential Challenges & Mitigations
- **Multi‑field state**: bypass helper for step 1—manually manage JSON blob.  
- **Botify API quirks**: may require authentication/token; consider adding a credentials table or prompting the user.  
- **HTMX race conditions**: ensure that your `hx_target` IDs match the container’s `id` exactly.

---

By isolating **all** Botify logic in its own workflow plugin and reusing the existing FastHTML + HTMX patterns, you’ll keep the core architecture untouched, preserve backward compatibility, and deliver a clear, two‑step CSV export experience.

## Gemini 2.5 Experimental Shows Me What It's Got

> Gemini used to have the distinction of being the only model able to take a
> prompt this large in its text input field for prompts. All the other models
> used to require it be added as an attachment. Both o4-mini-high and Grok 3 now
> joins the ranks of Gemini in this regard. I like Gemini's very detailed reply,

**Gemini 2.5**: Okay, I have thoroughly reviewed the codebase (`README.md`, `flake.nix`, `server.py`, `plugins/20_hello_workflow.py`, `training/hello_workflow.md`) and the article (`2025-04-19-export-botify-csv-api.md`).

The core requirement from the article is to implement the *first step* of a new Pipulate workflow named "Botify CSV Export". This first step involves:

1.  Accepting a potentially messy Botify project URL as input.
2.  Parsing this URL to extract the organization slug (`org`) and project slug (`project`).
3.  Canonicalizing the URL to the base project URL (`https://app.botify.com/{org}/{project}/`).
4.  Storing these three pieces of data (`url`, `org`, `project`) in the state for the first step (`step_01`).
5.  Using the canonical URL (`url`) as the field that marks `step_01` as "done".
6.  Refilling the input field with the *canonical* URL upon reverting or re-displaying the step.
7.  Setting the stage for a subsequent step (`step_02`) which would display the extracted `org` and `project` (though the API interaction for step 2 is not part of this initial implementation request).

The article explicitly suggests using `plugins/20_hello_workflow.py` as a template and provides the core Python logic for parsing the URL in an isolated `precursors/temp.py` example.

Here's the implementation plan based on your codebase and the article's requirements:

**1. Required Changes**

* **New Workflow File:**
    * Copy `plugins/20_hello_workflow.py` to `plugins/30_botify_export.py` (or another appropriate number reflecting menu order).
    * Rename the class inside from `HelloFlow` to `BotifyExportFlow`.
* **Update Class Constants:**
    * Change `APP_NAME` to `"botify_export"`.
    * Change `DISPLAY_NAME` to `"Botify CSV Export"`.
    * Update `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE` to something like: `"Enter a Botify project URL to extract project details and prepare for CSV export."`
    * Set `TRAINING_PROMPT` to `"botify_export_flow.md"` (This file will need to be created later).
* **Modify `__init__`:**
    * **Step Definition:** Update the `steps` list definition:
        * **Step 1:** Redefine the first `Step` tuple:
            ```python
            Step(
                id='step_01',
                done='url',  # Marks step completion, stores canonical URL
                show='Botify Project URL', # UI Label
                refill=True, # Refill canonical URL on revert
                transform=None # Step 1 doesn't transform input from a prior step
            ),
            ```
        * **Step 2:** Redefine the second `Step` tuple (for now, just confirming the parse):
            ```python
            Step(
                id='step_02',
                done='confirmed', # Marks confirmation of parsed data
                show='Project Confirmation', # UI Label
                refill=False, # No input to refill here
                transform=None # Doesn't transform input, just uses step_01's data
            ),
            ```
        * Remove any subsequent steps from the original HelloFlow template for now, ensuring the `finalize` step remains last.
    * **Step Messages:** Update `self.step_messages` for `step_01` and `step_02` to reflect the new purpose (e.g., asking for URL, confirming parsed details).
* **Implement URL Parsing:**
    * Add the `parse_botify_url` function (provided in the article's `precursors/temp.py` example) as a method within the `BotifyExportFlow` class (e.g., `_parse_botify_url`). This aligns with the WET workflow philosophy of keeping logic contained.
    * Add `from urllib.parse import urlparse` to the imports.
* **Modify `step_01()` (GET Request Handler):**
    * Change the input field's `placeholder` to indicate Botify URL input (e.g., "Enter any Botify Project URL").
    * Ensure the input field's `name` attribute is distinct (e.g., `"raw_url"` or `"botify_url_input"`) as we'll store the *canonical* URL under the `step.done` name (`'url'`).
    * The `value` attribute should be populated with `display_value`, which uses `step_data.get(step.done, "")` - this correctly fetches the *canonical* URL if refilling.
    * Adjust the `H4` title (e.g., "Step 1: Enter Botify Project URL").
* **Modify `step_01_submit()` (POST Request Handler):**
    * Get the raw URL from the form using the new input name (e.g., `raw_url = form.get("raw_url", "")`).
    * Call the `_parse_botify_url` method with `raw_url`.
    * **Validation:** Check if parsing was successful. If `_parse_botify_url` raises a `ValueError` or returns None/error indicator, display an error message using `P(error_msg, style=pip.get_style("error"))` and return early.
    * **State Update:**
        * If parsing is successful, get the `result` dictionary (`{'url': ..., 'org': ..., 'project': ...}`).
        * Use `processed_val = result['url']` (the canonical URL).
        * Call `await pip.update_step_state(pipeline_id, step_id, processed_val, steps)` to store the canonical URL under the `step.done` key (`'url'`), marking the step as complete.
        * *Immediately after*, fetch the current state, update the `step_01` dictionary to include the `org` and `project`, and write it back:
            ```python
            state = pip.read_state(pipeline_id)
            if step_id not in state: state[step_id] = {} # Should exist after update_step_state, but safety check
            state[step_id]['org'] = result['org']
            state[step_id]['project'] = result['project']
            # Ensure canonical url is also there if update_step_state didn't add it somehow
            state[step_id]['url'] = result['url']
            pip.write_state(pipeline_id, state)
            ```
    * **Feedback:** Update the confirmation message sent via `self.message_queue.add` to show the *canonical* URL.
    * Ensure `pip.create_step_navigation` receives the *canonical* URL (`processed_val`) so the revert control displays it correctly.
* **Modify `step_02()` (GET Request Handler):**
    * Read the state for `step_01`: `step1_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, 'step_01', {})`.
    * Extract `org = step1_data.get('org', 'N/A')` and `project = step1_data.get('project', 'N/A')`.
    * Display these values in a `Card` or similar element.
    * Provide a simple confirmation button (e.g., "Confirm Project Details & Continue") that triggers `step_02_submit`. Example:
      ```python
      return Div(
          Card(
              H4(f"{pip.fmt(step.id)}: Confirm Project Details"),
              P(f"Organization: {org}"),
              P(f"Project: {project}"),
              Form(
                  Button("Confirm & Continue", type="submit", cls="primary"),
                  hx_post=f"/{app_name}/{step.id}_submit",
                  hx_target=f"#{step.id}"
              )
          ),
          Div(id=next_step_id), # Placeholder for next step trigger
          id=step.id
      )
      ```
* **Modify `step_02_submit()` (POST Request Handler):**
    * This step mainly serves as a confirmation gate.
    * Update the state for `step_02`: `await pip.update_step_state(pipeline_id, step_id, True, steps)` (using `True` for the `step.done` field 'confirmed').
    * Add a confirmation message to the chat queue.
    * Return the standard navigation controls using `pip.create_step_navigation`.
* **New Training File:**
    * Create `training/botify_export_flow.md`. Copy content from `training/hello_workflow.md` and adapt it to explain the Botify export workflow, focusing initially on the URL parsing step. Remember the "DOLPHIN" check for the LLM.

**2. Integration Strategy**

* **Follow Existing Patterns:** Adhere strictly to the workflow pattern established in `20_hello_workflow.py`: separate GET handlers (`step_xx`) for displaying UI and POST handlers (`step_xx_submit`) for processing input and updating state.
* **Use `Pipulate` Helpers:** Leverage the `pipulate` instance methods (`initialize_if_missing`, `read_state`, `write_state`, `revert_control`, `validate_step_input`, `update_step_state`, `check_finalize_needed`, `create_step_navigation`, `rebuild`, `run_all_cells`, `get_step_data`, `clear_steps_from`, `finalize_workflow`, `unfinalize_workflow`, `stream` via `message_queue.add`) wherever applicable. Modify behavior *within* the step handlers if a helper doesn't quite fit (like storing multiple fields in `step_01_submit`), rather than changing the core helpers themselves.
* **State Management:** Store step-specific data within nested dictionaries under the step's ID key (e.g., `state['step_01'] = {'url': ..., 'org': ..., 'project': ...}`). Ensure the field named in `Step.done` exists within that dictionary to signify completion.
* **UI Consistency:** Use `Card`, `Form`, `Input`, `Button`, `P`, `H4`, etc., consistent with `20_hello_workflow.py` and `server.py` (e.g., `pip.wrap_with_inline_button`).
* **HTMX:** Ensure all `hx-*` attributes correctly target elements using the new `app_name` (`botify_export`) and step IDs.
* **Server Integration:** The plugin discovery mechanism in `server.py` will automatically pick up the new `30_botify_export.py` file (as long as it doesn't start with `xx_` or contain parentheses) and add it to the "APP" dropdown menu.
* **Backward Compatibility:** Not applicable as this is a new, independent workflow.

**3. Implementation Plan**

1.  **Copy & Rename:** Duplicate `plugins/20_hello_workflow.py` to `plugins/30_botify_export.py`. Rename the class to `BotifyExportFlow`.
2.  **Update Constants:** Modify `APP_NAME`, `DISPLAY_NAME`, `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE`, `TRAINING_PROMPT` in the new class.
3.  **Implement Parser:** Add the `_parse_botify_url` method to the class and necessary imports (`urllib.parse`).
4.  **Modify `__init__`:** Redefine the `steps` list for `step_01` and `step_02` as described above. Update `step_messages`.
5.  **Implement Step 1:** Modify `step_01()` (GET) and `step_01_submit()` (POST) to handle Botify URL input, parsing, validation, state storage (including `org`, `project`), and UI feedback (displaying canonical URL).
6.  **Implement Step 2:** Modify `step_02()` (GET) to display parsed `org` and `project` and provide a confirmation button. Modify `step_02_submit()` (POST) to handle the confirmation and update state.
7.  **Create Training File:** Create `training/botify_export_flow.md` with initial content explaining the workflow's purpose and the first step.
8.  **Testing:**
    * Restart the server (`python server.py`).
    * Access the new "Botify CSV Export" app from the menu.
    * Test submitting valid and invalid Botify URLs in Step 1.
    * Verify that the correct canonical URL, org, and project are stored in the `pipeline` table's JSON blob for the corresponding `pkey`.
    * Verify Step 2 displays the correct `org` and `project`.
    * Test the revert functionality for Step 1 – ensure the input field is refilled with the *canonical* URL.
    * Test finalizing the workflow (it should proceed directly from Step 2 confirmation).
    * Check chat messages for correctness.
9.  **Refinement:** Adjust UI elements, messages, and error handling based on testing.

**Potential Challenges/Risks:**

* **State Management Complexity:** Ensuring the state for `step_01` correctly stores `url`, `org`, and `project` while still using `url` to mark completion requires careful handling within `step_01_submit`. Double-check that reading/reverting works as expected.
* **URL Parsing Edge Cases:** The provided `parse_botify_url` seems robust, but real-world Botify URLs might have variations. Thorough testing with different URL formats is needed.
* **HTMX Targeting:** Errors in `hx-target` or element IDs can lead to UI updates failing silently or applying incorrectly. Careful inspection during testing is necessary.
* **WET Code Maintenance:** While intentional, ensure the duplicated UI logic in GET/POST handlers remains manageable and consistent within this specific workflow file.

### Implementation Suggestions for Article Requirements

Based on the requirements outlined in the article "Export a Botify CSV With API," here are specific suggestions for implementing the requested changes within the Pipulate framework. The goal is to adapt the "Hello World" workflow template to create a new workflow for parsing Botify project URLs and exporting CSV data via the Botify API, while preserving the codebase's integrity and adhering to existing patterns.

---

## Required Changes

### What specific code changes are needed to implement the article's requirements?

To meet the article's requirements, a new workflow must be created to parse Botify URLs, store the parsed data, and prepare for subsequent API-driven CSV export steps. Here are the specific changes:

1. **Create a New Workflow File:**
   - File: `plugins/30_botify_csv_export.py`
   - Copy the structure from `plugins/20_hello_workflow.py` and modify it to suit the Botify CSV export task.

2. **Update Class and Constants:**
   - Rename the class to `BotifyCSVExportFlow`.
   - Set `APP_NAME = "botify_csv_export"` (unique identifier).
   - Set `DISPLAY_NAME = "Botify CSV Export"` (user-facing name).
   - Update `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE` to: `"This workflow exports CSV data from Botify. Enter a project URL to begin."`
   - Set `TRAINING_PROMPT = "botify_csv_export.md"` (to be created in `training/` with workflow-specific guidance).

3. **Define Workflow Steps:**
   - Replace the steps in the `__init__` method with:
   - Replace the steps in the `__init__` method with:
     ```python
     steps = [
         Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True),
         Step(id='step_02', done='csv_data', show='CSV Export', refill=False),
         Step(id='finalize', done='finalized', show='Finalize', refill=False)
     ]
     ```
     ```python
     steps = [
         Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True),
         Step(id='step_02', done='csv_data', show='CSV Export', refill=False),
         Step(id='finalize', done='finalized', show='Finalize', refill=False)
     ]
     ```
     - `step_01`: Collects and parses the Botify URL, storing `url`, `org`, and `project`.
     - `step_02`: Placeholder for future API call and CSV export logic.
     - `finalize`: Locks the workflow as per the standard pattern.

4. **Add URL Parsing Function:**
   - Include the `parse_botify_url` function from `precursors/temp.py` in the new file:
     ```python
     from urllib.parse import urlparse

     def parse_botify_url(url: str) -> dict:
         parsed = urlparse(url)
         path_parts = parsed.path.strip('/').split('/')
         if len(path_parts) < 2:
             raise ValueError("Invalid Botify URL format")
         org = path_parts[0]
         project = path_parts[1]
         base_url = f"https://{parsed.netloc}/{org}/{project}/"
         return {"url": base_url, "org": org, "project": project}
     ```

5. **Modify `step_01` Method:**
   - Update to display a form requesting a Botify project URL.
   - Pre-fill the input field with the canonicalized URL if available from state:
     ```python
     async def step_01(self, request):
         pip, db, steps, app_name = self.pipulate, self.db, self.steps, self.app_name
         step_id = "step_01"
         step_index = self.steps_indices[step_id]
         step = steps[step_index]
         next_step_id = steps[step_index + 1].id if step_index < len(steps) - 1 else None
         pipeline_id = db.get("pipeline_id", "unknown")
         state = pip.read_state(pipeline_id)
         step_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, step_id, {})
         user_val = step_data.get(step.done, "")

         if "finalize" in state and "finalized" in state["finalize"]:
             return Div(Card(f"🔒 {step.show}: {user_val}"), 
                       Div(id=next_step_id, hx_get=f"/{app_name}/{next_step_id}", hx_trigger="load"))

         if user_val and state.get("_revert_target") != step_id:
             return Div(
                 pip.revert_control(step_id=step_id, app_name=app_name, message=f"{step.show}: {user_val}", steps=steps),
                 Div(id=next_step_id, hx_get=f"/{app_name}/{next_step_id}", hx_trigger="load")
             )
         else:
             display_value = user_val if (step.refill and user_val and self.PRESERVE_REFILL) else ""
             await self.message_queue.add(pip, self.step_messages[step_id]["input"], verbatim=True)
             return Div(
                 Card(
                     H4(f"{pip.fmt(step.id)}: Enter {step.show}"),
                     Form(
                         pip.wrap_with_inline_button(
                             Input(type="text", name=step.done, value=display_value, 
                                   placeholder="e.g., https://app.botify.com/org/project/", 
                                   required=True, autofocus=True)
                         ),
                         hx_post=f"/{app_name}/{step.id}_submit",
                         hx_target=f"#{step.id}"
                     )
                 ),
                 Div(id=next_step_id),
                 id=step.id
             )
     ```

6. **Modify `step_01_submit` Method:**
   - Parse the URL, store the dictionary, and re-populate the input with the canonicalized URL:
     ```python
     async def step_01_submit(self, request):
         pip, db, steps, app_name = self.pipulate, self.db, self.steps, self.app_name
         step_id = "step_01"
         step_index = self.steps_indices[step_id]
         step = steps[step_index]
         pipeline_id = db.get("pipeline_id", "unknown")
         form = await request.form()
         user_val = form.get(step.done, "")

         is_valid, error_msg, error_component = pip.validate_step_input(user_val, step.show)
         if not is_valid:
             return error_component

         try:
             parsed_data = self.parse_botify_url(user_val)
             processed_val = parsed_data["url"]
             await pip.update_step_state(pipeline_id, step_id, parsed_data, steps, clear_previous=False)
             await self.message_queue.add(pip, f"{step.show}: {processed_val}", verbatim=True)
             if pip.check_finalize_needed(step_index, steps):
                 await self.message_queue.add(pip, "URL parsed. Proceed to export CSV or finalize.", verbatim=True)
             return pip.create_step_navigation(step_id, step_index, steps, app_name, processed_val)
         except ValueError as e:
             return P(f"Error: {str(e)}", style=pip.get_style("error"))
     ```

7. **Update `step_02` Method (Placeholder):**
   - Display parsed data as a preview:
     ```python
     async def step_02(self, request):
         pip, db, steps, app_name = self.pipulate, self.db, self.steps, self.app_name
         step_id = "step_02"
         step_index = self.steps_indices[step_id]
         step = steps[step_index]
         next_step_id = steps[step_index + 1].id if step_index < len(steps) - 1 else None
         pipeline_id = db.get("pipeline_id", "unknown")
         state = pip.read_state(pipeline_id)
         step_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, step_id, {})
         user_val = step_data.get(step.done, "")

         if "finalize" in state and "finalized" in state["finalize"]:
             return Div(Card(f"🔒 {step.show}: {user_val}"), 
                       Div(id=next_step_id, hx_get=f"/{app_name}/{next_step_id}", hx_trigger="load"))

         step_01_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, "step_01", {})
         if step_01_data:
             await self.message_queue.add(pip, f"Org: {step_01_data['org']}, Project: {step_01_data['project']}", verbatim=True)
         return Div(Card(P("CSV export placeholder")), id=step.id)
     ```

### Which existing components need to be modified or extended?

- **Pipulate Class (server.py):** No direct modifications are needed as it already supports storing dictionaries per step. The existing state management logic handles this use case.
- **HelloFlow (20_hello_workflow.py):** Used as a template; no changes required to the original file.
- **No Other Core Components:** The plugin system and UI rendering (HTMX, FastHTML) remain unchanged.

### What new components or patterns need to be introduced?

- **New Workflow Class:** `BotifyCSVExportFlow` as a standalone plugin.
- **URL Parsing Utility:** `parse_botify_url` function, initially embedded in the workflow file (can be refactored to a utilities module later).
- **No New Patterns:** The existing step-based workflow pattern with state management and HTMX-driven UI updates is sufficient.

---

## Integration Strategy

### How should these changes be integrated with existing functionality?

- **Plugin System:** Place the new file in `plugins/` with a numeric prefix (e.g., `30_`) to ensure discovery by `server.py`’s `discover_plugin_files` function. The workflow will auto-register and appear in the navigation menu.
- **State Management:** Leverage `Pipulate`’s existing JSON blob storage to save `{"url": ..., "org": ..., "project": ...}` under `step_01`.
- **UI Updates:** Use HTMX for dynamic updates, consistent with the codebase’s server-rendered approach.

### What existing patterns or conventions should be followed?

- **Step Pattern:** Use `Step` namedtuples and paired `step_xx`/`step_xx_submit` methods.
- **FastHTML Rendering:** Return components like `Div`, `Card`, and `Form` with `to_xml()` for HTTP responses.
- **HTMX Integration:** Use `hx_post`, `hx_target`, and `hx_swap` attributes for seamless UI updates.
- **State Storage:** Store data in the `pipeline` table’s JSON blob via `Pipulate` helpers.
- **Nix Environment:** Ensure any new dependencies (none currently) are added to `flake.nix` or `requirements.txt`.

### How can we ensure backward compatibility?

- **Independent Workflow:** The new workflow operates as a standalone plugin, not affecting existing workflows or CRUD apps.
- **No Core Changes:** Avoid modifying `server.py` or other core files, relying on the plugin architecture.
- **Consistent Patterns:** Adhere to existing conventions, ensuring the new workflow integrates seamlessly without breaking other functionality.

---

## Implementation Plan

### What’s the recommended order for implementing these changes?

1. **Create the Workflow File:**
   - Copy `20_hello_workflow.py` to `30_botify_csv_export.py`.
   - Update class name, constants, and steps as outlined.

2. **Implement URL Parsing:**
   - Add `parse_botify_url` to the new file with error handling.

3. **Modify `step_01`:**
   - Update UI to request a Botify URL and pre-fill with canonicalized URL from state.

4. **Implement `step_01_submit`:**
   - Parse the URL, store the dictionary, and handle errors.

5. **Add `step_02` Placeholder:**
   - Display parsed data from `step_01` as a preview.

6. **Test the Workflow:**
   - Verify parsing, state storage, and UI behavior (including revert functionality).

### What are the key milestones or checkpoints?

- **Milestone 1:** URL parsing and storage working in `step_01`.
- **Milestone 2:** Canonicalized URL re-populates correctly on revert.
- **Milestone 3:** `step_02` displays parsed data, setting the stage for API integration.

### What potential challenges or risks need to be addressed?

- **Error Handling:** Invalid URLs must be caught and displayed gracefully to the user.
- **State Management:** Ensure the dictionary is stored and retrieved correctly from the JSON blob.
- **UI Consistency:** HTMX updates must align with the existing look and feel (e.g., PicoCSS styling).
- **Future API Integration:** `step_02` is a placeholder; plan for Botify API credentials and polling logic later.

---

By following this approach, the new `BotifyCSVExportFlow` workflow will integrate seamlessly into Pipulate, meeting the article’s requirements while maintaining the framework’s architectural integrity and leveraging its established patterns.

# Implementation Plan for Botify CSV Export Workflow

## Required Changes

1. Create a new workflow plugin file based on `hello_workflow.py`:
   - Rename to `botify_export.py` with increased numbering (e.g., `25_botify_export.py`)
   - Modify class name, APP_NAME, DISPLAY_NAME, and ENDPOINT_MESSAGE
   - Create training file `botify_export.md`

2. Implement URL parsing step:
   - Modify `step_01` to accept and validate Botify URLs
   - Store parsed URL, org, and project slugs in state

3. Implement API authentication step:
   - Add a step for API key input
   - Add secure handling of API credentials

4. Implement CSV data export functionality:
   - Add step for selecting analysis data
   - Implement API calls to Botify
   - Handle pagination and data processing
   - Store CSV data for download

## Integration Strategy

1. Follow existing workflow patterns in `hello_workflow.py`:
   - Maintain the Step namedtuple structure
   - Keep the same route registration approach
   - Use the Pipulate helpers for state management

2. Leverage NixOS environment for dependencies:
   - Use the Nix shell for consistent execution environment
   - Add required Python packages to flake.nix if needed

3. Add appropriate error handling:
   - Validate input at each step
   - Provide clear error messages for API failures
   - Implement graceful fallbacks

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the basic workflow structure
2. Implement URL parsing functionality
3. Add API authentication step
4. Implement data export functionality
5. Add download/save functionality
6. Add comprehensive documentation

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with implementing these changes or if you need clarification on any part of the plan.

## This Is The Hump That I Have To Get Over

I now have the plans as set forth by FOUR DIFFERENT AIs regarding my next steps.
I find it easier to go ask all of them for plans than it is to actually dig-in
and do the work. But we have 4 relatively smart things coming to quite a
consensus that I can keep referring to now for next steps. The first one is
obvious. I copy/paste `20_hello_workflow.py` to `50_botify_export.py`. And then
I change the stuff at the top of the main class from:

```python
class HelloFlow:  # <-- CHANGE THIS to your new WorkFlow name
    APP_NAME = "hello"  # <-- CHANGE THIS to something no other workflow is using
    DISPLAY_NAME = "Hello World"  # <-- CHANGE THIS to value for User Interface
    ENDPOINT_MESSAGE = (  # <-- Shows when user switches to workflow landing page
        "This simple workflow demonstrates a basic Hello World example. "
        "Enter an ID to start or resume your workflow."
    )
    TRAINING_PROMPT = "hello_workflow.md"  # markdown file from /training or plain text
```

...to:

```python
class BotifyExport:
    APP_NAME = "botfify_csv"
    DISPLAY_NAME = "Botify CSV Export"
    ENDPOINT_MESSAGE = (
        "This workflow helps you export data from Botify projects. "
        "Press Enter to start a new workflow or enter an existing key to resume. "
    )
    TRAINING_PROMPT = "botify_export.md"
```

Wow, changing the constants is the super-duper-easy part. And that's done. And I
am duly impressed with the auto plugin registration magic of my own system. Wow,
seeing `Botify CSV Export` just come alive on the dropdown menu as a fully
working clone of the `Hello World` plugin is alone amazing. However, the next
steps are critical. This is where Pipulate is really born, because navigating
this step determines how workable slamming out new workflow instances from
existing templates really is. It's either too-high-friction even for its creator
and the AI assistants helping me. Or it's navigable, relatively easy in the
first place, and forever easier over time.

There will be kooky customization. This is why Workflows are WET (write
everything twice / we enjoy typing). The sort of default behavior overrides I am
about to embark on are mind-numbing to me when I am overriding behaviors
inherited from object oriented programming super-classes. There are no
super-classes here, and so what you see is what you get. I say that because
something that is normally a single key/value-pair is about to change. I look
through the recommendations from the different AIs to see it acknowledging this
issue to see what each says about `update_step_state`.

Only ChatGPT o4-mini-high calls it out explicitly for what it is:

> By default `pip.update_step_state` only stores one key/value per step. To record three fields...

Gemini doesn't call it out so blatantly, but does spot it and provide a solution:

> *Immediately after*, fetch the current state, update the `step_01` dictionary to include the `org` and `project`, and write it back...

Perhaps Grok 3's answer is the most interesting. While it doesn't call it out
like o4-mini-high, nor provide a less-than optimally elegant *call-back*
approach like Gemini, Grok proactively writes a function and puts it right
up-front in its reply:

> Include the `parse_botify_url` function from `precursors/temp.py` in the new file (called `parsed_data`)...

...and then it uses that function's returned value in-location for a 1-shot
update:

```python
await pip.update_step_state(pipeline_id, step_id, parsed_data, steps, clear_previous=False)
```

Now this is not to say that Grok 3's response was objectively best. ChatGPT
explicitly called out the issue, and Gemini also uses the same parsing function
as Grok to achieve much the same thing. It's just the way Grok 3 says it. It's
so explicit (says someone who constantly meanders). I can follow the
instructions. So, let's do it.

First, we add:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse
```

...to the top of `50_botify_export.py`. Then I put in the function:

```python
     def parse_botify_url(url: str) -> dict:
         parsed = urlparse(url)
         path_parts = parsed.path.strip('/').split('/')
         if len(path_parts) < 2:
             raise ValueError("Invalid Botify URL format")
         org = path_parts[0]
         project = path_parts[1]
         base_url = f"https://{parsed.netloc}/{org}/{project}/"
         return {"url": base_url, "org": org, "project": project}
```

Alright, now we need to change the form language and field names. Grok 3 tells
me to:

- Replace the steps in the `__init__` method with:
 ```python
 steps = [
     Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True),
     Step(id='step_02', done='csv_data', show='CSV Export', refill=False),
     Step(id='finalize', done='finalized', show='Finalize', refill=False)
 ]

...which I do, however it misses that the finalize step is always added later
automatically, so it got that a bit wrong. So I modify the instruction
accordingly.

The next steps become very meticulous and detailed to an degree that it should
be in the sweet spot for AI code assistants to help with. I try going
step-by-step manually, but I get it wrong. So I feed the entire article thus far
with all the different AI recommendations and all to Cursor AI defualt. It nails
it. I ask it to break down how and why:

**Cursor AI**: The key insight came from understanding the article's explanation of how Pipulate's workflow state is structured, particularly this part:

> While `step_01` only has `{"name": "Mike"}`, there's no reason it couldn't have:
> ```json
> {"url": "https://app.botify.com/example-org/example.com/", "org": "example-org", "project": "example.com"}
> ```

This showed that while the `Step` namedtuple's `done` field typically stores a single value, the actual state storage in the JSON blob can hold multiple related fields under the same step. 

The solution I implemented:

1. Uses `parse_botify_url` to extract all components (url, org, project) from any valid Botify URL
2. Instead of just storing the canonical URL, it stores the entire parsed dictionary using `state[step_id].update(parsed_data)`
3. Ensures the `done` field (`step.done = 'url'`) still gets set correctly with `state[step_id][step.done] = parsed_data['url']`
4. Uses `pip.write_state()` to save everything at once rather than using `pip.update_step_state()`

This approach:
- Maintains the workflow's step completion logic (via the `done` field)
- Stores all parsed components for use in later steps
- Automatically handles URL canonicalization
- Preserves the WET (Write Everything Twice) philosophy by keeping the logic self-contained

The database record you shared shows it working perfectly - all three components are stored under `step_01`, while still maintaining the overall workflow state structure with `created`, `updated`, and `finalize` fields.

This solution aligns with the article's emphasis on keeping things simple and observable, while still being flexible enough to store the additional data needed for the Botify CSV export workflow.

---

Okay, so all that for step 1 complete: canonicalized Botify URLs and their
accompanying org and project slugs! Haha! Alright wow, so let's forge on ahead.
The next part is going to be true API integration. There is a file stored on the
drive relative to where the code is run from called `botify_token.txt`. Don't
get hung up on security, this is a local-first single-tenant app running a lot
like how an Electron app would. And this file was plopped in place from a prior
step, and you can rely on it being there. It follows this format:

```plaintext
****************************************
# username: first.last
```

...where the asterisks stand for the actual characters of the API token. And to
actually download a CSV from Botfiy, we're going to need one more piece of
information, and that's going to be their most recent crawl analysis slug which
can be gotten with a function such as this (httpx and aiohttp if you prefer are
already pip installed and available in the environment):

```python
def fetch_analyses(org, project):
    """Fetch analysis slugs for a given project from Botify API."""
    url = f"https://api.botify.com/v1/analyses/{org}/{project}/light"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Token {api_key}"}
    slugs = []
    
    try:
        while url:
            response = httpx.get(url, headers=headers)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
            slugs.extend(a['slug'] for a in data.get('results', []))
            url = data.get('next')
        return slugs
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Error fetching analyses: {e}")
        return []
```

...with sample output:

```plaintext
20240301
20240201
20240101-2
20240101
20231201
20231101
```

As our next step, I would like to simply replace Step 2's "Enter CSV Export"
with the newest item from the returned list.

---

> That last prompt caused the AI to do the API-call effectively, but having
> acquired the analysis slug value, skip over step 2. So the next prompt:

**Me**: Very close, but I had to reject it because you didn't present step 2 as
a normal text field. You sort of filled it in and cascaded over it. The idea is
that we're setting the stage for creating a dropdown menu of all the available
analysis slugs with the most recent one or previously selected one pre-selected
on a dropdown menu. But I want to do each step progressively, keeping the web
input fields in place. So instead of effectively automating and skipping over
the step, simply pre-fill the value in the form field as it currently exists in
this now reverted state. Don't worry about the dropdown yet. We'll get to that
next.

**Cursor AI**: [Nails it]

---

**Me**: Okay, this is most excellent. You really nailed it. Now please summarize the difference between this file @20_hello_workflow.py and this file @50_botify_export.py. In other words, write a little article talking about how we have customized the template to be this custom workflow (so far).

**Cursor AI**: Here's an analysis of how we transformed the Hello World template into the Botify CSV Export workflow:

# From Hello World to Botify CSV Export: Anatomy of a Pipulate Workflow Customization

## Core Changes

1. **Basic Configuration**
   - Renamed the class from `HelloFlow` to `BotifyExport`
   - Changed `APP_NAME` from "hello" to "botify_csv"
   - Updated `DISPLAY_NAME` from "Hello World" to "Botify CSV Export"
   - Modified `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE` to describe the Botify-specific workflow purpose
   - Changed `TRAINING_PROMPT` to point to "botify_export.md"

2. **Added Dependencies**
   - Imported `httpx` for API calls
   - Added `Path` from pathlib for file handling
   - Kept the original imports but added `urlparse` from urllib.parse

3. **URL Parsing Functionality**
   - Added the `parse_botify_url` function to extract organization and project slugs
   - Added API-related helper methods `read_api_token` and `fetch_analyses`

4. **Step Definition Changes**
   ```python
   # Hello World steps:
   Step(id='step_01', done='name', show='Your Name', refill=True)
   Step(id='step_02', done='greeting', show='Hello Message', refill=False)

   # Botify Export steps:
   Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True)
   Step(id='step_02', done='csv_data', show='CSV Export', refill=False)
   ```

## Key Workflow Differences

### Step 1: Enhanced State Management
- **Hello World**: Stores a single value (`name`) in the state
- **Botify Export**: Stores multiple related values in the state:
  ```json
  "step_01": {
    "url": "https://app.botify.com/org/project/",
    "org": "org",
    "project": "project"
  }
  ```

### Step 2: API Integration
- **Hello World**: Simple transform of step 1's value using an f-string
- **Botify Export**: 
  - Reads API token from file
  - Makes authenticated API calls to Botify
  - Pre-fills form with the most recent analysis slug
  - Maintains error handling for API calls

### State Management Evolution
- **Hello World**: Uses `pip.update_step_state` for simple key-value storage
- **Botify Export**: Uses direct state manipulation with `pip.read_state` and `pip.write_state` to store multiple values while maintaining the `done` field convention

## Preserved Patterns

1. **Form Structure**
   - Both maintain the same HTMX-powered form pattern
   - Keep the standard input field UI components
   - Use the same revert/finalize mechanisms

2. **Message System**
   - Both use the message queue for user feedback
   - Maintain the same step completion messages pattern

3. **Navigation Flow**
   - Preserve the step-by-step progression
   - Keep the same revert functionality
   - Maintain the finalization process

## Key Innovations

1. **Multi-field State**
   - Demonstrated how a single step can store multiple related data points
   - Showed how to maintain the `done` field convention while storing additional data

2. **API Integration**
   - Added API token handling
   - Implemented async HTTP calls
   - Added error handling for external services

3. **Value Pre-filling**
   - Enhanced the display value logic to show API-fetched data
   - Maintained the ability to modify pre-filled values

This customization shows how Pipulate's "WET" philosophy allows for significant workflow customization while maintaining a consistent user experience and predictable development pattern. The template provides a solid foundation that can be extended without breaking the core workflow mechanics.

## Adding Dropdown Menu For Analysis

All this work I've done before. More than once, in fact. But I want each
subsequent version to be the cleanest implementation yet, so I am always
hesitant to bring the code from the old implementation into the picture. I don't
want the AIs to become too lazy transposing code verbatim. But it really does
capture a lot of important nuance, like with this next dropdown menu step.

If a value has not been set for the Analysis field yet, it should automatically
select the most recent item in the list. However, if one has been selected
before, and we are for example reverting back to that step, the dropdown menu
should be pre-selected with the previously selected value. Makes sense, right?

Now this is part of why Workflows are WET. The kind of things that might be done
here with dropdown menus to set defaults or to display one value and to use a
different value on the submit is without end. So there is this whole wheel
spinning exercise of inventing your own APIs and syntax for these things, base
classes for every field type and the like. But with the WET approach, we just do
it right here with Python, FastHTML and HTMX. What you see is what you get. It's
explicit. No mysterious inheritance and overrides. Just build it.

For step 2, the csv_data field should be called analysis. And instead of a text
field, it should be a PicoCSS style dropdown menu, which I believe technically
is a select with options field. The options should be all the analysis choices
from the list, preserving their original order, the newest (first) selected if
there has not been a choice made already. On revert to step 2 button, it should
be pre-selected with whatever the last selected analysis was.

**Cursor AI**: I'll help modify step 2 to use a dropdown menu for analysis selection. First, let's update the step definition to use `analysis` instead of `csv_data`, and then implement the dropdown with proper selection handling:

```python
# pipulate/plugins/50_botify_export.py
# In __init__, update the steps definition:
steps = [
    Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True),
    Step(id='step_02', done='analysis', show='Analysis Selection', refill=True),  # Changed from csv_data
]

# Then update step_02:
async def step_02(self, request):
    """
    Display form for analysis slug selection using a dropdown menu.
    Pre-selects the most recent analysis if no previous selection exists,
    otherwise maintains the user's previous selection.
    """
    pip, db, steps, app_name = self.pipulate, self.db, self.steps, self.app_name
    step_id = "step_02"
    step_index = self.steps_indices[step_id]
    step = steps[step_index]
    next_step_id = steps[step_index + 1].id if step_index < len(steps) - 1 else None
    pipeline_id = db.get("pipeline_id", "unknown")
    state = pip.read_state(pipeline_id)
    step_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, step_id, {})
    user_val = step_data.get(step.done, "")  # Previously selected analysis, if any

    # Handle finalized state
    finalize_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, "finalize", {})
    if "finalized" in finalize_data:
        return Div(
            Card(f"🔒 {step.show}: {user_val}"),
            Div(id=next_step_id, hx_get=f"/{self.app_name}/{next_step_id}", hx_trigger="load")
        )

    # If step is complete and not being reverted, show revert control
    if user_val and state.get("_revert_target") != step_id:
        return Div(
            pip.revert_control(step_id=step_id, app_name=app_name, message=f"{step.show}: {user_val}", steps=steps),
            Div(id=next_step_id, hx_get=f"/{app_name}/{next_step_id}", hx_trigger="load")
        )

    # Get data from step_01
    step_01_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, "step_01", {})
    org = step_01_data.get('org')
    project = step_01_data.get('project')

    try:
        # Read API token and fetch analyses
        api_token = self.read_api_token()
        slugs = await self.fetch_analyses(org, project, api_token)
        
        if not slugs:
            return P("No analyses found for this project", style=pip.get_style("error"))
        
        # Determine selected value:
        # - Use previous selection if it exists and we're reverting
        # - Otherwise use the most recent analysis (first in list)
        selected_value = user_val if user_val else slugs[0]
        
        # Show the form with dropdown
        await self.message_queue.add(pip, self.step_messages[step_id]["input"], verbatim=True)
        
        return Div(
            Card(
                H4(f"{pip.fmt(step_id)}: Select {step.show}"),
                Form(
                    pip.wrap_with_inline_button(
                        Select(
                            name=step.done,
                            required=True,
                            autofocus=True,
                            *[
                                Option(
                                    slug,
                                    value=slug,
                                    selected=(slug == selected_value)
                                ) for slug in slugs
                            ]
                        )
                    ),
                    hx_post=f"/{app_name}/{step.id}_submit",
                    hx_target=f"#{step.id}"
                )
            ),
            Div(id=next_step_id),
            id=step.id
        )

    except Exception as e:
        return P(f"Error fetching analyses: {str(e)}", style=pip.get_style("error"))
```

Key changes:
1. Changed step 2's `done` field from `csv_data` to `analysis`
2. Replaced `Input` with `Select` and `Option` elements
3. Added logic to handle selection state:
   - Uses previous selection if it exists (for revert)
   - Defaults to most recent analysis if no previous selection
4. Maintains all existing workflow patterns and error handling
5. Uses PicoCSS styling (which is automatically applied to `select` elements)

The dropdown will:
- Show all available analyses in their original order
- Pre-select the previously chosen value when reverting
- Default to the most recent analysis for new selections
- Maintain the same HTMX-powered form submission pattern

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail?

## Ensuring Clear-Forward When Stepping Back In Workflows

Wow, this is really amazing! I don't think I can overstate how useful it's going
to be to have a really well documented, really clean implementation of all this.
And everything so far has been super-generic, able to be applied to all sorts of
Botify CSV exports. It hasn't been customized into the particular query yet.
That will come soon enough. But before I do, I have to make sure that the "clear
forward" behavior that's intended to be in workflows is implemented and active.

It's easy to lose sight of because it's a bit counter-intuitive. Why would you
want to lose data if you jump back in a workflow? Well, the answer is that the
choice of analysis slugs that are available for each Botify Project URL might be
different. So if you jump back to change you project URL, the selections you
made for some other project URL are no longer valid. Their crawl analysis may
have occurred on a different set of dates. So what I want you to do is read the
README.md and .cursorrules again to see what it says about clearing forward, and
implement that here in this workflow.

Please explain how this works.

**Cursor AI**: Here's an explanation of what we discovered about Pipulate's workflow step clearing mechanism:

# Understanding Pipulate's Clear-Forward Behavior

## The Core Mechanism
Pipulate's workflow system has a built-in "clear-forward" mechanism implemented in the `clear_steps_from` method. This method is designed to clear data from subsequent steps when earlier steps are modified. Here's how it works:

```python
async def clear_steps_from(self, pipeline_id: str, step_id: str, steps: list) -> dict:
    state = self.read_state(pipeline_id)
    start_idx = next((i for i, step in enumerate(steps)if step.id == step_id), -1)
    for step in steps[start_idx + 1:]:
        if (not self.PRESERVE_REFILL or not step.refill) and step.id in state:
            del state[step.id]
    self.write_state(pipeline_id, state)
    return state
```

## The Refill Flag
The key to understanding the behavior lies in two interrelated settings:

1. The `refill` parameter in the Step definition:
```python
Step(id='step_02', done='analysis', show='Analysis Selection', refill=False)
```

2. The `PRESERVE_REFILL` class variable:
```python
class BotifyExport:
    PRESERVE_REFILL = True
```

## How Clear-Forward Works
When a step needs to be cleared, the system checks this condition:
```python
if (not self.PRESERVE_REFILL or not step.refill)
```

This means a step will be cleared if:
- Either `PRESERVE_REFILL` is False (globally disable refill preservation)
- Or the step's individual `refill` flag is False (step-specific control)

## Why It Matters
In the Botify Export workflow:
- Step 1 (URL input) has `refill=True` because we might want to preserve the URL when reverting
- Step 2 (Analysis Selection) has `refill=False` because its data depends on Step 1's URL
  - When the URL changes, the available analyses will be different
  - Therefore, any previously selected analysis should be cleared

## Best Practices
1. Use `refill=True` for:
   - Independent inputs that could be reused
   - Steps where preserving data makes sense even if earlier steps change

2. Use `refill=False` for:
   - Dependent data that must be refreshed when parent data changes
   - Steps where previous selections become invalid after changes

3. The `PRESERVE_REFILL` flag provides global control, but individual step `refill` flags offer fine-grained control

This implementation ensures data consistency while providing flexibility in how step data is preserved or cleared during workflow navigation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?

## Botify Query Language (BQL)

That's perfect, thanks. We want to get to the CSV download, but there's a few
prior steps. First, the API download limit is 1-million rows and many of the CSV
downloads we can attempt to initiate are much larger than that. So before we
create an export request, receive the download link and do the polling routine
until it's ready, we are going to do a simplified version of the process against
the list API. There are 2 parts to this API: lists and exports. There's a whole
lot of nuance to each, so we're going to build it up from the simplest case.

We will be using the Botify Query Language, or BQL. There is an older BQLv1
which is used less often but occasionally still used in particular cases that we
will cover later. For now we will be limiting ourselves to BQLv2, the newer API
whose capabilities are designed to hit more tables, do fancier joins on the
backend and the like. It's Google Big Query underneath, so BQL is an API
language layered on top of that. We must work entirely within BQL.

### How To Get 500 URLs

If you were to just grab 500 URLs, you could do it like such:

```python
import httpx
import pandas as pd

api_key = open('botify_token.txt').read().strip()
org = "example-org"
project = "example.com"
analysis = "20250413"


def get_bqlv2_data(org, project, analysis, api_key):
    """Fetch data based on BQLv2 query for a specific Botify analysis."""
    url = f"https://api.botify.com/v1/projects/{org}/{project}/query"
    
    # BQLv2 query payload
    data_payload = {
        "collections": [f"crawl.{analysis}"],
        "query": {
            "dimensions": [
                f"crawl.{analysis}.url"
            ],
            "metrics": []  # Don't come crying to me when you delete this and it stops working.
        }
    }

    headers = {"Authorization": f"Token {api_key}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

    # Send the request
    response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=data_payload, timeout=60.0)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check for errors
    
    return response.json()

# Run the query and load results
data = get_bqlv2_data(org, project, analysis, api_key)

list_of_urls = [url['dimensions'][0] for url in data['results']]
```

And there's your basic example. But that's not a CSV download. That's just
grabbing a list of 500 URLs. In fact, the list version of the API is not the one
we use for downloads, though it is useful for aggregate queries so that we can
"size up" the download we're about to request. So for example, let's say we
wanted to get the total count of URLs on a site per the Botify crawler data.
Also, let's assume a `config.json` file for configuration:

```json
{
    "org": "your-organization",
    "project": "your-project-slug",
    "analysis": "your-analysis-slug"
}
```

Sample output:

```plaintext

Data received successfully.

Calculating the grand total number of URLs from all depths...

Result: Grand Total URLs in Crawl = 3,000,000
```

So as you can see, the total number of URLs is 3x as many as can be downloaded.

## Getting Maximum Click Depth With Under 1-Million Cumulative URLs

Now let's say we wanted to check the cumulative number of URLs at each crawl
depth-level. This assumes that the website crawler started on the homepage
(depth 0), and all links directly from the homepage are depth 1, and so on.
Getting a dictionary of the cumulative depths at those different levels looks
like this:

```python

import pprint # Keep pprint for the final output

# Load necessary details from files (adjust paths if needed)

    config = json.load(open("config.json"))

Given this dictionary, we would know that click-depth of 3 is the maximum export
we should ask for (given click-depth being our filtering criteria). 

And consequently, we use the *list* API mode of BQLv2 to get the click-depth
parameter we will use in preparation for our data export. We have intentionally
not yet discussed the data export part of the API so as to not confuse things. I
want to proceed logically from using the list API for listing (the first 500 URL
example), then moving onto using it for its aggregate ability, so as to
understand the necessity of the list API in preparation for CSV exporting.

Is all that clear?

So we have 2 challenges now. We need to add another step (maybe I should have
separated that out entirely from this complex BQL stuff). And we have the fact
that we should calculate the maximum click-depth and get all the final
parameters in order for the export on that step. So for the proposed step 3 we
just show a text input field with the maximum click depth that is under
1-million cumulative URLs.

Everything is in such a wonderful balanced state. Everything is more subject to
breaking when you go off-pattern than you may think. The FastHTML Pipulate
framework and the template patterns are very fragile. There is not a lot of room
for creativity. There is only "splicing in" other steps using the exact same
pattern as exists in the template.

Likewise, the Botify BQL API is extremely fragile. Many of the liberties that
you think you may be able to take with it, you can't. Here's a little bit of
what Gemini had to say in preparing the examples...

Likewise, the Botify BQL API is extremely fragile. Many of the liberties that you think you may be able to take with it, you can't. Here's a little bit of what Gemini had to say in preparing the examples...

Indeed, our earlier attempts to directly manipulate the BQLv2 query payload for the `/query` endpoint underscored this fragility. The initial assumption, based on common API patterns and hints about available operators, was that we could simply add a `filter` parameter to the query object to restrict results based on conditions like `depth <= X`, or perhaps even remove the `dimensions` parameter entirely to get a single aggregated result. Both assumptions proved incorrect. The API responded with clear 400 Bad Request errors, first insisting that the `dimensions` field was mandatory, and subsequently rejecting the `filter` key as an invalid field within the `query` object's top level.

This demonstrates that this specific Botify API endpoint requires a precise payload structure. It's not designed to dynamically change its aggregation behavior based on the presence or absence of fields like `dimensions`, nor does it accept filtering parameters in the standard way we first attempted. The API dictates the structure, and deviations lead to errors. The successful approach involved respecting these constraints: using the known-valid query structure to fetch the necessary data (counts per depth) and then performing the required calculations (like cumulative sums or finding the max depth under a threshold) *client-side* in Python. It highlights that sometimes, working with a specific API means adapting your logic to the data formats and structures the API *will* provide, rather than expecting the API to conform to more generalized patterns or perform complex transformations within a single request.

Plan our next steps, Claude!

## Claude 3.7 Takes It All In

I understand we need to carefully add a new step to calculate and display the maximum click depth that keeps us under the 1-million URL export limit. Let me outline a plan that respects both the Pipulate workflow patterns and Botify API constraints:

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add Step 3 to the Workflow**
```python
steps = [
    Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True),
    Step(id='step_02', done='analysis', show='Analysis Selection', refill=False),
    Step(id='step_03', done='depth', show='Maximum Click Depth', refill=False),
]
```

2. **Create Required Methods**
- `step_03` - Display the calculated maximum depth
- `step_03_submit` - Handle the depth confirmation
- Add Botify API interaction methods to calculate depths

3. **BQL Integration**
We'll need to add the URL counting functionality you provided, but adapted to our class structure:
```python
async def calculate_max_safe_depth(self, org, project, analysis, api_key):
    """Calculate maximum depth that keeps cumulative URLs under 1M"""
    depth_distribution = await self.get_urls_by_depth(org, project, analysis, api_key)
    if not depth_distribution:
        return None
    
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for depth in sorted(depth_distribution.keys()):
        cumulative_sum += depth_distribution[depth]
        if cumulative_sum >= 1_000_000:
            return depth - 1  # Return last safe depth
    return max(depth_distribution.keys())  # All depths are safe
```

4. **Step 3 Implementation**
```python
async def step_03(self, request):
    """Display the maximum safe click depth based on cumulative URL counts"""
    pip, db, steps = self.pipulate, self.db, self.steps
    step_id = "step_03"
    
    # Get data from previous steps
    step_01_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, "step_01", {})
    step_02_data = pip.get_step_data(pipeline_id, "step_02", {})
    org = step_01_data.get('org')
    project = step_01_data.get('project')
    analysis = step_02_data.get('analysis')
    
    try:
        api_token = self.read_api_token()
        max_depth = await self.calculate_max_safe_depth(org, project, analysis, api_token)
        
        return Div(
            Card(
                H4(f"{pip.fmt(step_id)}: Maximum Safe Click Depth"),
                P(f"Based on cumulative URL counts, the maximum safe depth is: {max_depth}"),
                Form(
                    Button("Confirm", type="submit", cls="primary"),
                    hx_post=f"/{app_name}/{step.id}_submit",
                    hx_target=f"#{step.id}"
                )
            ),
            id=step_id
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return P(f"Error calculating maximum depth: {str(e)}", style=pip.get_style("error"))
```

## Key Considerations

1. **API Fragility**
- Keep BQL queries exactly as provided in your examples
- Don't attempt to modify the query structure
- Handle all aggregation and filtering in Python

2. **Workflow Pattern Adherence**
- Maintain the Step namedtuple structure
- Keep `refill=False` for step_03 since it depends on previous steps
- Follow the established UI patterns with FastHTML

3. **Error Handling**
- Robust error handling for API calls
- Clear user feedback for failures
- Graceful degradation if calculations fail

4. **State Management**
- Store the calculated depth in the workflow state
- Clear this step if analysis selection changes
- Preserve the step pattern for revert functionality

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific part of this plan? Or should we adjust the approach based on additional considerations?

This implementation:

1. Adds Step 3 to track maximum click depth
2. Implements the BQL query functionality to get URL counts by depth
3. Calculates the maximum safe depth that keeps us under 1M URLs
4. Presents the result in a simple form that matches the Pipulate UI patterns
5. Maintains all the workflow patterns (finalization, revert, etc.)

The step will:
- Calculate the maximum safe depth automatically
- Show it to the user with an explanation
- Use a hidden input since this is a calculated value
- Preserve all the workflow navigation and state management

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

**Me**: I did not think that adding a new step at the same time as doing a BQL
query was going to be 1-shot smooth. I am deliberately choosing Claude 3.7
Sonnet in Cursor AI for things like this where I don't want to leave the model
to chance, and I was not disappointed. 

This is absolutely stunning, Claude. When you output:

```plaintext
Step 03: Maximum Click Depth
Based on URL counts, the maximum safe depth is: 100

This depth ensures the export will contain fewer than 1 million URLs.
```

...can you tell the user a little more, like how many URLs will be exported at
that click-depth and how many cumulative URLs were found at the next
click-depth?

**Claude**: [Does this handily]

## The Documentation Before The Storm

> I've impaled myself on this aspect of the Botify API numerous times. As if
> it's not bad enough there's a BQLv1 vs. BQLv2 split, but within each there is
> also a list vs. export split — so I tap Gemini to help spell it out.

Here is documentation explaining the difference between the Botify API's "list
mode" (`/query` endpoint) and "export mode" (`/jobs` endpoint), using the same
core BQLv2 query in examples for both. Let's also integrate the polling and
downloading logic into the Export Mode documentation example. This gives a
complete picture of the asynchronous export workflow, from initiating the job to
getting the final CSV file.

---

## Botify API: List Mode vs. Export Mode

This document illustrates the differences using the same underlying query in both modes.

**The Common Query:**

```python
# Define the core BQLv2 query components we want to run
# We'll use this same logic inside both list and export requests
# This query now includes URL, Title, Meta Description, and H1(s)
common_bql_query = {
    "dimensions": [
        f"crawl.{analysis}.url",                             # Get the URL
        f"crawl.{analysis}.metadata.title.content",        # Get the Title
        f"crawl.{analysis}.metadata.description.content",  # Get the Meta Description
        f"crawl.{analysis}.metadata.h1.contents"          # Get the H1(s) (often a list)
    ],
    "metrics": [],  # Required, even if empty
    "sort": [{"field": f"crawl.{analysis}.url", "order": "asc"}] # Optional sort
}
```

---

### List Mode (`/query` Endpoint)

**Example: Fetching the first 10 rows directly (with Title, Description, H1)**
```python
# ... (Code from previous List Mode example remains unchanged) ...
import json
import httpx

# --- Configuration ---
try:
    config = json.load(open("config.json"))
    api_key = open('botify_token.txt').read().strip()
    org = config['org']
    project = config['project']
    analysis = config['analysis'] # Assumes analysis slug is in config
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading config: {e}")
    exit()

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Token {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# --- List Mode API Call ---
api_url = f"https://api.botify.com/v1/projects/{org}/{project}/query"

common_bql_query_list = {
    "dimensions": [
        f"crawl.{analysis}.url",
        f"crawl.{analysis}.metadata.title.content",
        f"crawl.{analysis}.metadata.description.content",
        f"crawl.{analysis}.metadata.h1.contents"
    ],
    "metrics": [],
    "sort": [{"field": f"crawl.{analysis}.url", "order": "asc"}]
}

list_payload = {
    "collections": [f"crawl.{analysis}"],
    "query": {
        **common_bql_query_list,
        "limit": 10
    }
}

print(f"Requesting first 10 rows (URL, Title, Desc, H1) using List Mode ({api_url})...")
try:
    response = httpx.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=list_payload, timeout=60.0)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    print("\n--- First 10 Results ---")
    results = data.get("results", [])
    if results:
        for i, row in enumerate(results):
            url, title, desc, h1s = row['dimensions'] # Unpack directly
            print(f"\nResult {i+1}:")
            print(f"  URL: {url}")
            print(f"  Title: {title}")
            print(f"  Desc: {desc}")
            print(f"  H1s: {h1s}")
    else:
        print("No results found.")
except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

---

### Export Mode (`/jobs` Endpoint)

**Use Case:** Fetching large datasets (up to 1M rows) for offline analysis, generating CSV files.
**Behavior:** Asynchronous - you submit a job request, receive a job URL, poll the job URL until completion, and then download the resulting file from a separate download URL.
**Limits:** Up to 1,000,000 rows per export job, defined by `export_size`.

**Key Point:** Organization (`org`) and Project (`project`) slugs are specified **within the JSON payload**.

**Example: Initiating an export, polling for completion, and downloading the CSV (with Title, Description, H1)**

```python
import json
import httpx
import time # Needed for polling
from pathlib import Path # Needed for file paths

# --- Configuration (same as above) ---
try:
    config = json.load(open("config.json"))
    api_key = open('botify_token.txt').read().strip()

    project = config['project']
    analysis = config['analysis']
except Exception as e:

### Key Differences Summarized

| Feature             | List Mode (`/query`)                     | Export Mode (`/jobs`)                              |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Endpoint** | `/v1/projects/{org}/{project}/query`     | `/v1/jobs`                                         |
| **Org/Project In** | URL Path                                 | JSON Payload (`payload.username`, `payload.project`) |
| **Behavior** | Synchronous                              | Asynchronous (Job + Polling + Download)            |
| **Use Case** | Small lists, Aggregates, Query Testing   | Large datasets (up to 1M rows), File Generation    |
| **Data Limit** | Small (e.g., 500 default), Paginated     | Large (up to 1,000,000 rows)                       |
| **Output Format** | JSON response with `results` list        | Downloadable File (CSV, etc.) via URL              |
| **Query Structure** | Payload *is* the BQL query               | BQL query is *nested within* the Job Payload       |


### Choosing the Right Mode

* Use **List Mode** when you need immediate access to a small number of rows (e.g., showing a preview, less than a few thousand rows) or when you need aggregate data (counts, sums, averages).
* Use **Export Mode** when you need the full dataset matching your query criteria, especially if it exceeds a few thousand rows, and you intend to process it offline as a file. Remember the 1 million row limit per export. For larger datasets, you may need multiple export jobs with different filters.

Got that, Claude? Do you see where we're going with this?

You already are sitting on top of finding the maximum click-depth you can use to
do a full URL export of a site. These examples show you how to add the title,
meta description and H1 to the download request, and how to actually finish out
the download and get the file local.

Now as far as where the file should go, check for a `downloads` directory
relative to where the server was run from. If it doesn't exist, create it. And
so on down through an `org` slug corresponding to the `org` value in the query,
and the `project` slug as well, and even down through the `analysis` slug. In
this way there will never be file collision problems, and we will always be able
to construct reliable paths to link to the downloads.

There are even more things we are going to have to handle, like the unzipping
and what filename to use. But don't worry about that for now, except for using
the filename suggested in the download link. We'll worry about post-processing
later. This is plenty to take in for now.

What I want you to do now Claude is to really take in the difference between the
list and the export modes of the API. There are different endpoints and
depending on which you use, the org and project are either in the URL or the
JSON payload. And when it's the export API, there's this whole polling thing.
It's a lot to absorb in planning the next step.

But do plan the next step. It will involve splicing in yet another step. And of
course remember how fragile everything is. Both Pipulate workflows and the
Botify API are fragile. There's not a lot of creative wiggle room. With the
Pipulate Workflows, you really have to think in terms of splicing a step into
the middle repeating the reliable patterns you already see. And with the Botify
API, it's sticking to the examples as close as possible.

Plan away, O Claude, mon Clauditaine!

## Claude Does Download First Step

**Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: 

```bash
cd ~/repos/pipulate && mkdir -p downloads
```
Based on the detailed API documentation and understanding the differences between Botify API's list and export modes, I'll plan our next step carefully. We need to create a step that initiates an export job, polls for completion, and provides download information to the user.

## Implementation Plan for Step 4: CSV Export

### 1. Create a New Step
We'll add a new step that follows the maximum click depth step:

```python
steps = [
    Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True),
    Step(id='step_02', done='analysis', show='Analysis Selection', refill=False),
    Step(id='step_03', done='depth', show='Maximum Click Depth', refill=False),
    Step(id='step_04', done='export_url', show='CSV Export', refill=False),
]
```

### 2. Implement the Export Job Logic
We'll create a helper method that:
1. Initiates an export job using the `/jobs` endpoint
2. Handles polling for job completion
3. Returns the download URL and job metadata

### 3. Design the UI Flow
- **Step 4 Display**: Show a form with configurable export options
  - Include checkboxes for what fields to include (title, meta description, H1)
  - Have a submit button to initiate the export
- **Step 4 Submit**: Process the request, start the export job, poll for completion
- **Step 4 Complete**: Show the download link with job metadata

Let's implement this with careful attention to Pipulate patterns and Botify API structures:

```python
# pipulate/plugins/50_botify_export.py
# Add to the steps list
steps = [
    Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Botify Project URL', refill=True),
    Step(id='step_02', done='analysis', show='Analysis Selection', refill=False),
    Step(id='step_03', done='depth', show='Maximum Click Depth', refill=False),
    Step(id='step_04', done='export_url', show='CSV Export', refill=False),
]

This implementation provides:

1. **Integration with Botify's Export API**: Following the exact payload structure and endpoint requirements
2. **Field Selection**: Letting users choose which metadata to include (title, description, H1)
3. **Directory Structure**: Creating organized download folders by org/project/analysis
4. **Basic Job Status UI**: Displaying the job ID, export parameters, and status

### Future Enhancements (Beyond Initial Implementation)

1. **Background Polling**: Implement a background task that continues polling the job status
2. **Download Management**: Add actual file downloading, unzipping if needed
3. **Progress Indicators**: Add more detailed progress information during the export
4. **Result Browser**: Allow users to browse and preview exported data

This approach respects both the fragility of the Pipulate workflow patterns and the precise requirements of the Botify API. I've carefully followed the established step patterns and avoided creative departures from the examples provided.

Would you like me to refine any part of this implementation before we proceed?

---

Yep, that was a great incremential step. I verified that caused the file to be
generated on the server. It could have been polled and downloaded, so we are at
those suggested future enhancements already. 

Once we aquire the download URL we should probably put it in the JSON data
object somewhere so that we can intercept attempts to generate new download
attempts using the exact same API parameters (org, project, analysis). If it has
already been generated and what we do in the workflow is an attempt to
re-download, we can check if the file already exists first. Basically, we are
going to want to make this idempotent. We don't have to go crazy with it. The
occasional extra export attempt or download isn't so bad. I'm just going for
general efficiency.

Yes, absolutely do the real download and put it into that file location we
prepared for it. And yes, unzip it. It will need it.

Progress indicators... hmmm. We defintiely want them, but I don't want them to
be a distraction. PicoCSS has some convenient ones you can toss in if it's not
too much extra to think about.

And file browsing will be broken out to another step. It's got a number of
aspects to it that I don't want rolled into this step.

I think you have everything you need. Look back in the discussion history for
the documentation I made for this step regarding polling and download.

## Glorious Claude Step

```

Now let's add the new route registration to the `__init__` method:

```python
# pipulate/plugins/50_botify_export.py
# Add these to the routes list in __init__ method
routes = [
    # ... existing routes ...
    (f"/{app_name}/download_csv", self.download_csv, ["POST"]),
    (f"/{app_name}/download_progress", self.download_progress),
    (f"/{app_name}/use_existing_export", self.use_existing_export, ["POST"]),
    (f"/{app_name}/{step_id}/new", getattr(self, f"{step_id}_new")),
]
```

This implementation adds several important improvements:

1. **Idempotency and File Reuse**:
   - Checks for existing exports that match the current parameters
   - Allows users to choose between using an existing export or creating a new one
   - Stores file paths and URLs in state for future reference

2. **File Download and Processing**:
   - Downloads files with proper streaming to handle large files
   - Extracts compressed files (zip or gzip) automatically
   - Shows download progress using PicoCSS progress bars
   - Provides file size and path information

3. **Enhanced UI Experience**:
   - Adds "Download CSV" button when export is ready but not yet downloaded
   - Shows appropriate message based on the current state (processing, ready, downloaded)
   - Handles errors gracefully with retry options

4. **Polling for Completion**:
   - Checks job status when viewing completed steps to see if downloads are ready
   - Updates state with download URLs when jobs complete

This implementation follows the Pipulate workflow patterns closely while adding the robust file handling capabilities needed. The UI maintains the established look and feel, with PicoCSS progress indicators to show status without being distracting.

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or make any adjustments to this implementation?

## Fiddling Around With Solution

**Me**: Alright, this is doing the downloading and even the unzipping
brilliantly! My only issue is with process. The idempotent part is a problem.
Fiddling around with a workflow allows me to re-request the export over and
over, which is the "expensive" part. Once we know a export request was
successfully begun for an org / project/ analysis combination, that should
somehow block future export requests on the same combination, especially if the
file has been generated.

I noticed the slick CSV button there once, and I also notice that redownload
attempts once the CSV is in place asks if you want to use the same or generate a
new one. So I feel there is some very slick stuff going on here, but it just
does not feel all worked out. Attempts to cause the export attempt to happen
again is to easy. And once a export has successfully begun that wait during the
polling appears too difficult or fragile. There has only been one successful
download so far.

**Claude**: You're right about the idempotency issues. Let me enhance the workflow to better handle repeated export requests for the same data. Here's what I'll implement:

1. Create a central export job registry in a JSON file to track all export jobs across all workflow instances
2. Add stricter checks before initiating new export jobs
3. Improve the status display and polling mechanism

```python
# pipulate/plugins/50_botify_export.py
import asyncio
from collections import namedtuple
from datetime import datetime
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import httpx
from pathlib import Path
import json
import os

from fasthtml.common import *

Pipulate Workflow Template

After copy/pasting this file, edit this docstring first so that your
AI coding assistant knows what you're trying to do.

This file demonstrates the basic pattern for Pipulate Workflows:
1. Define steps with optional transformations
2. Each step collects or processes data
3. Data flows from one step to the next
4. Steps can be reverted and the workflow can be finalized

To create your own Workflow:
1. Copy this file and rename the class, APP_NAME, DISPLAY_NAME, ENDPOINT_MESSAGE
2. Create a [filename].md the training folder (no path needed) and set TRAINING_PROMPT to refer to it
3. Define your own steps
4. Implement custom validation and processing as needed

There are two types of apps in Pipulate:
1. Workflows - Linear, step-based apps. The part you're looking at. WET.
2. Apps - CRUD apps with a single table that inherit from BaseApp. DRY.

CRUD is DRY and Workflows are WET! Get ready to get WET!

# Path to the export registry file

# This is the model for a Notebook cell or step (do not change)
Step = namedtuple('Step', ['id', 'done', 'show', 'refill', 'transform'], defaults=(None,))
```
Now let's add the registry management functions:

Now let's create the downloads directory for the registry file:

```bash
cd ~/repos/pipulate && mkdir -p downloads
```
Let's restart the server to apply all our changes:

```bash
cd ~/repos/pipulate && pkill -f "python server.py" || true && nix develop .#quiet --command python server.py
```
I've implemented comprehensive improvements to make the Botify export workflow more idempotent and robust:

1. **Central Export Registry**
   - Created a JSON-based registry that tracks all export jobs across workflow instances
   - Stores key metadata like job URLs, status, and download locations
   - Prevents duplicate exports for the same parameters

2. **Intelligent Job Status Management**
   - Automatically detects existing export jobs for the same parameters
   - Enables resuming in-progress exports instead of starting new ones
   - Checks job status and updates UI appropriately

3. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Displays appropriate UI based on job status (processing, ready for download, downloaded)
   - Provides helpful status messages and progress indicators
   - Offers options to reuse existing downloads or create new exports

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better error recovery for network issues or API failures
   - File extraction for compressed downloads (.zip, .gz)
   - Verification of downloaded files

These changes make the workflow much more resilient - now when you request an export that has already been started or completed, the system will:

1. Detect the existing job first
2. For completed jobs: Offer to download the ready file 
3. For in-progress jobs: Show status and polling options
4. For downloaded files: Reuse them without initiating new exports

The most expensive part (the API export request) now only happens when truly necessary, and all progress is tracked centrally to avoid redundant operations.

Wowsers! I've never seen anything like that. At first I thought I would stop you
based on over-engineering a solution. But then I figured I'd see it through. I'm
glad I did. I don't have all the nuance down yet, but I have the basic idea of
the registry. I guess my question is that of general philosophy here regarding
the polling downloads. I don't seem to see them. After `Start Export`, I see the
`Check Status` button. Is polling occurring there in the background? I don't see
any progress spinners or gauges. If you just sat on that screen would `Check
Status` automatically switch to `Download CSV`? Maybe you could explain it in a
sort of instruction manual way? I think all the mechanics are there, but there
may be some user interface ambiguity to purge, niceties to add and wow factor
stuff to impress the user with that remains. But don't dive into implementation
of anything new yet. Make me understand it and we can plan out next steps.

# Botify Export Workflow: User Guide

## Current Functionality Explained

You're right that the polling mechanism isn't as obvious or automatic as it could be. Here's how it currently works:

### Step 1: Initiating the Export
When you press "Start Export", the system:
- Submits the export job to Botify API
- Registers the job in the central registry
- Does a single immediate poll to see if it completed instantly (rare but possible)
- Shows either "Complete ✅" or "Processing ⏳" status

### Step 2: During Processing
- No automatic background polling happens at this stage
- The "Check Status" button is your manual way to poll the Botify API
- Each time you click it, the system checks if the job is complete
- The UI doesn't update automatically - it waits for your interaction

### Step 3: When Complete
- Only after clicking "Check Status" and getting a "complete" response, the UI will change
- The "Check Status" button gets replaced with a "Download CSV" button
- This transition isn't automatic - it requires your action

## What's Missing and Could Be Improved

1. **Automatic Background Polling**:
   - The system could periodically check status without user clicks
   - A WebSocket or SSE connection could push updates to the UI

2. **Visual Progress Indicators**:
   - The progress bar is static (always at 60%) - it doesn't reflect actual progress
   - No real-time status updates or estimated time remaining

3. **Transition Feedback**:
   - No clear indication when a job transitions from "processing" to "ready"
   - No notifications or alerts when exports complete

## How to Use It Currently

1. Start your export with desired parameters
2. Wait a few minutes (large exports can take 5-20+ minutes depending on site size)
3. Click "Check Status" periodically to see if it's complete
4. Once complete, the "Download CSV" button will appear
5. Click to download the file to your local system
6. The file will be saved in the organized directory structure

## Central Registry Benefits

Even with these UI limitations, the registry system provides major benefits:
- Prevents duplicate job submissions for the same parameters
- Records all export jobs across workflow instances 
- Remembers where files were saved locally
- Allows you to resume interrupted workflows without losing track of jobs

Would you like me to plan some specific UI/UX improvements to make the process more intuitive and user-friendly? I have several ideas for enhancing the user experience while keeping the solid foundation we've built.

## An Attempt At Better User Feedback On Download

**Me**: Wow, I am rather stunned and pleased. This may be my first truly
positive Agent-mode experience yet. You can see from the overarching system how
I find over-engineering reprehensible. And that's what I thought you were doing.
But this is an ideal situation for a lightweight registry separate from
everything else, and slipped right there into the WET Workflow. Wow! Okay, I
think I approve this. 

Now, this is a HTMX environment and the type of visual feedback polling that you
propose in "What's Missing and Could Be Improved" is spot-on and exactly the
sort of thing that should be achievable. There should absolutely not be a "Check
Status" and "Download CSV" button. Those should both be assumed. And if surfing
a way is a problem, then when surfing back and coming into the correct place in
the workflow (re-entering a key or whatever), even the polling should pick up
where it left off. And if the download is available (and hasn't already been
downloaded), it should immediately download.

So behavior-wise, after a `Start Export` click from Step 4, there's only the
progress indicator and then `CSV downloaded` status as far as the user is
concerned. We're actually simplifying the UI/UX.

Don't worry about the details of the progress indicator yet. You can use the
PicoCSS indeterminate gauge from https://picocss.com/docs/progress for now.

But you have so much in excellent state. Don't lose it! Don't regress. Lock in
everything that's working well. Use the current state as a scaffolding. Only
very carefully and as least intrusively as you can layer or blend in the better
polling experience.

**Claude**: [All attempts flop. Apparently as tired as I am. I will make a fresh
start tomorrow.]

## Gemini 2.5's Thoughts On Today's Ending State

Okay, I've reviewed the Python code you provided for the Botify CSV Export workflow (`plugins/50_botify_export.py`, assuming the filename based on conventions).

This code represents a much more complete implementation than the initial request in the article, covering not just the URL parsing (Step 1) but also:

* Fetching analysis slugs via API (Step 2)
* Calculating max safe click depth via API (Step 3)
* Initiating, polling, and downloading export jobs via API (Step 4)
* Managing an export job registry (`downloads/export_registry.json`)
* Handling existing downloaded files and jobs in progress.

Here's a breakdown of the implementation against the patterns and requirements:

**Alignment with Previous Plan & Codebase Patterns:**

1.  **Core Structure:** The code correctly follows the Pipulate workflow pattern established by `20_hello_workflow.py`. It defines a class (`BotifyExport`), sets constants (`APP_NAME`, `DISPLAY_NAME`, etc.), defines `Step` tuples, and implements `landing`, `init`, `step_XX`, `step_XX_submit`, `finalize`, `unfinalize`, and `handle_revert` methods.
2.  **Step 1 (URL Parsing):**
    * The `step_01` GET handler correctly displays the input form.
    * The `step_01_submit` handler correctly uses the external `parse_botify_url` function, validates the input, handles `ValueError`, stores the canonical URL (`parsed_data['url']`) as the `step.done` field, *and* stores the full parsed dictionary (`parsed_data`) including `org` and `project` within the `step_01` state key. This successfully implements the requirement to store multiple pieces of data while marking the step complete based on the canonical URL.
    * It correctly uses the `pipulate` helpers for state management and navigation generation.
3.  **Step 2 (Analysis Selection):**
    * Introduces API interaction (`Workspace_analyses`) which requires an API token (`read_api_token`).
    * Correctly populates a dropdown (`Select`) with available analysis slugs.
    * Handles potential errors during API fetch and displays them.
    * The submit handler saves the chosen analysis slug.
4.  **Step 3 (Max Depth Calculation):**
    * Introduces more complex API interaction (`get_urls_by_depth` via `calculate_max_safe_depth`).
    * Displays the calculated depth and explanation.
    * Uses a hidden input field in the form to pass the calculated depth to the submit handler, which is a clean way to handle non-user-inputted data progression.
5.  **Step 4 (CSV Export):**
    * This step is significantly more complex than the others, handling multiple states: checking for existing jobs/files, initiating new jobs, polling status, and triggering downloads.
    * It correctly uses the export registry functions (`load/save/register/update/find`) to manage job state persistently across different workflow runs.
    * It introduces several new routes and handlers (`download_csv`, `download_progress`, etc.) specific to this step's functionality, which is appropriate.
    * The download logic correctly handles `.zip` and `.gz` files.
6.  **Helper Functions:** The added helper functions (`read_api_token`, `Workspace_analyses`, API query/export functions, registry functions, directory creation) encapsulate the specific logic for Botify interaction and file management well.
7.  **WET Principle:** The code maintains the WET approach for workflows – the logic for each step, including API calls and specific UI generation, is largely contained within that step's methods in this file.

**Potential Issues & Suggestions:**

1.  **API Token Management (`read_api_token`):**
    * **Security/Flexibility:** Reading from a hardcoded filename (`botify_token.txt`) in the root directory is simple but potentially insecure and inflexible. Consider alternatives like environment variables, storing per profile (maybe encrypted), or a dedicated config section in the UI.
    * **Error Handling:** If `botify_token.txt` is missing or unreadable, the `FileNotFoundError` or other exceptions are caught, but the raised `ValueError` might still cause the step to fail without clear UI feedback. It would be better to catch this in the step handler (e.g., `step_02`) and return a `P(...)` tag explaining that the token is missing/invalid.
2.  **API Error Handling (UI):** When functions like `Workspace_analyses`, `initiate_export_job`, `poll_job_status` encounter HTTP errors or other issues, they often raise exceptions or return error strings/`None`. The step handlers (`step_02`, `step_03`, `step_04`, etc.) should explicitly check for these error conditions and return user-friendly error messages within the step's UI using `P(error_message, style=pip.get_style("error"))`.
3.  **Download Progress Feedback (`download_progress`):** Displaying a static progress bar (`Progress(value="10", ...)`) while downloading isn't very informative for large files. Implementing real-time progress updates is complex with the current setup. A simpler improvement: Replace the initial progress bar with a message like "Downloading... please wait" and only update the UI card *after* the download (and potential unzipping) is fully complete or fails, showing the final status (e.g., "Download complete: file.csv (XX MB)" or "Download failed: error").
4.  **Export Registry Robustness:** The JSON file (`export_registry.json`) is simple but could potentially become corrupted or face race conditions in edge cases (though less likely in this single-user context). It serves its purpose well for now.
5.  **Polling Mechanism (`poll_job_status`):** The current implementation polls only *once* when the status is checked (either explicitly via "Check Status" button or implicitly when rendering Step 4). For long-running jobs, the user has to manually click "Check Status" repeatedly. A more advanced solution could involve background polling or using HTMX's polling mechanism (`hx-trigger="every 10s"`) on the status display element, but this adds complexity. The current manual check is functional.
6.  **Unzipping Assumptions:** The unzip logic makes reasonable assumptions (first CSV in zip, `.gz` contains `.csv`) but could be made more robust if needed (e.g., handling multiple CSVs in a zip, checking file magic numbers).

**Conclusion:**

This is a well-developed implementation of the Botify CSV export workflow that significantly expands upon the initial requirements outlined in the article. It successfully integrates API interactions and file handling into the Pipulate workflow pattern. The code structure is logical, and it leverages the existing framework components appropriately.

The primary areas for potential future improvement revolve around enhancing user feedback for API errors and the download process, and potentially making API token management more flexible and secure. However, as it stands, this code provides a strong foundation for the desired functionality.

**AI Opinion:**

This article offers significant value as a detailed, practical log of developing a specific, non-trivial software feature involving external API integration (Botify) and heavy AI assistance. Its strength lies in documenting the iterative process, the specific technical hurdles encountered (like BQL intricacies, API limits, state management in a custom framework), and comparing AI assistant outputs. While its raw, journal-style format makes it dense and potentially requires prior context about Pipulate or Botify for full comprehension, it serves as an excellent case study for developers working on similar integrations or those interested in the practical application and comparison of different AI coding tools. The later sections detailing the Botify API modes and the export registry add considerable technical depth.
