Whoah, July 2nd already? Time is going by so fast. I'm back on my Windows 11
"Darth Laptop", cracked screen and all. But 80/20=Rule, you know.

And so what's up in the world? It seems pretty crazy, right? It's almost as if
every last stop is being taken out of the way of the AI's. They're being
allowed to run wild. And I'm not sure if it's because they're so powerful that
they can't be stopped now.

Be distracted, monkeys! Be distracted! And so we are. We're distracted by
everything. And the AI's are running wild. And I'm not sure if it's because
they're so powerful that they can't be stopped now. Or if it's because they're
so powerful that they can't be stopped now.

Ha ha ha! I love Copilot AI's sense of humor! But how much did Syd write and
now much was from me? Wink ;-)

Hmmm. Next step?

A few comments. Gaza? France? Disclosure? I'm not sure. I'm not sure what's
going on. I'm not sure what's going on.

I get most of my news through digital. I wonder if I can tune into HAM Radio
still with one of my old Radio Shack radios? Try tuning in on the analog news
sources. Baring that, look at different sources. Twitter is a valid source.
