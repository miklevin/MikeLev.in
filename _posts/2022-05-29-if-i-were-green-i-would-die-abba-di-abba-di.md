title: If I Were Green I Would Die. Abba Di Abba Di.
headline: "Determined to Succeed: A YouTuber’s Journey of Resilience and Creativity"
description: I am a YouTuber determined to succeed without compromising my standards. I discuss the difficulty of editing videos on YouTube, how APIs can be misleading, and the power of programming languages like Python and vi. I also explore the duality of red and green energy, the strength of diversity, and the power of creativity and natural hunting skills. Finally, I share my experience of shooting my best livecast ever and how it reminded me of the resilience I have developed over the years.

My kid would like to be a professional YouTuber or TikToker and I tell them:

> Those who can do and those who can't, stream. <br />
> <br />
> <cite>&#151;Mike Levin, 2022</cite><br />

But what I do for work, plus my life experiences and everything about who I am
makes me able to just walk in and take over the YouTubes if I wanted to. Big
talk from a little man. Prove it... okay, okay. It's part of that [growing a
backbone](/blog/when-i-grew-a-backbone-story-of-the-samurai-mudskipper/) we
discussed.

# An em-dash By Any Other Encoding Is Still The Same

How the heck do I type those long minus&#nbsp;sign things? It's called an
em-dash and is my favorite glyph and probably the most long, linear character
in all typesetting. Is that standard? Yes! They're so standard, they're in the
lower set of charcaters within the [255 ASCII ISO-Latin1 character
set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement) of old fashioned
computers before the days of Unicode. em-dashes are very common and part of
traditional typesetting and book publishing. And you used to be able to type
them too with Alt+0151 (numbers must be typed on keypad), until the world moved
from desktops to laptops and the number-pads on our keyboards disappeared. HTML
***entity encoding*** to the rescue! You can put them in markdown using
ampersand hash 151 semicolon. *POOF*

Show the folks searching in Google on an encoded entity. Done. That went well.

Okay, so back from distraction.

# Channeling Your Inner Hulk Channeling Your Inner Bruce Banner

Go show the folks bringing back yesterday's livecast recording, and your
discoveries about editing already-on-YouTube videos and the weirdness's. Nuance
and subtlety is ***everything***. Capabilities and power ***always*** come from
digging deeper. And that doesn't take ***real*** intelligence so much as it
takes persistence... the Hulk with only a touch of Bruce Banner... Roomba!

# Eff Common Wisdom. Blow Up Dirty.

I'm navigating my way to a blow-up on YouTube without compromise. I'm going to
try something new. Common wisdom would say break out a new channel and focus on
smaller, well edited videos on just the topics people like and want to hear
about. Eff-that. I'm going to stick with my old rough-edges channel where I had
to drop the "e" in mikelevin for my channel and I mix personal and professional
stuff going back to 2006.

I've even been told that the "mik" in miklevin could even be interpreted as a
racial slur against the Irish. To that I say, please associate me with the
Irish. Now I'm not Irish and I can't use it the playful way those striving to
take power away from a word do, but it's not broken out of as a standalone
word, it doesn't have the "k" in it, it has a good, solid reason for being that
way (other MikeLevin's register that first), and the movie Superbad has a
McLovin. And so the assertion that there's anything derogatory about miklevin
is the babbling of the oversensitive. I'd refer you to Family Guy clips, but
I've also got this:

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="2HTHPtoNJLk" %}

I am a YouTuber. I YouTube a lot. I have 2 million-view videos and over thirty
videos with over 10,000 views. I have a friend who moved to Alaska who started
YouTubing (different person than the overly miklevin-sensitive mentioned above)
and when I showed him one of my videos, he's like "Oh, you're a YouTuber now?"
I answered with a laugh, "Yes, but only since 2006." He laughed too. Dave Mays
is a really good guy. I learned about database Primary Keys and ERD diagrams
from him. It's the same channel that goes back to 2006 that I'm promoting here.

# Editing Videos on YouTube After Streaming or Upload

I talk a bit about editing videos on YouTube after streaming or after upload.
It's tricky. You have to wait for the timeline thumbnails to appear before the
"Save As" button becomes a "Save" button so you can replace the origin video
in-location preserving views and comments.

I am thankful for this feature, however I do see the very significant problem
that the main reason to want to edit a video after streaming is that you don't
want whatever it was seen until the edit was made. For that, you have to turn
the video private and wait what seems 24 hours. So if people want to re-watch
right away they can't until after at least 24-hours, assuming I make the edit
and turn it back to public promptly when the feature becomes available.

Things are rough with YouTube. Things are rough with me. Touché!

# YouTube Real Time Streaming Analytics Lie. APIs Lie In General.

I point out how the YouTube streaming real-time analytics never really shows
you how many people are online accurately. This is no big deal for big
streamers for whom plus or minus one person is no big deal. But for me, plus or
minus one person is the difference between anyone being there or not... for
now.

Point being, APIs (application program interfaces) will lie to you. APIs do lie
to you. Expect APIs to lie to you. Even if the documentation says one thing, if
it's important whether that thing is true or not, test it.

# Quite Contrary

I'm going to rub everyone's nose in the fact that I'm doing the contrarian
thing, and I'm going to make it work ***because of that***. If there's a hunger
for genuine people out there struggling with self-betterment, I'm going to feed
it. Let ***THEM*** be my people and not those awful bombastic bribing beasts.

> Mary, Mary, quite contrary<br />
> What makes your audience grow?<br />
> Don't sell out to punks who pout<br />
> You digress&#151;and you're slow.<br />

# vi IS NOT The Editor of The Beast

I speak of text editors and not of bribing the audience with prizes. I am not
the beast. There are no prizes here, as you internalize skills for a lifetime
that will help you think, help you express yourself, help you gain confidence,
help you find grounding, help you code, help you work and improve your life.

No, there are no prizes here. I am not the beast.

I represent Joy. There will be no bill for joy. It is free.

Bill Joy says "People don't know that vi was written for a world that doesn't
exist anymore". (Bill Joy wrote vi).

But it does, Bill. It does. Were cars made ***too*** easy to drive? Are
keyboards ***too*** easy to type on? There is no such thing as a text editor
that is ***too*** efficient, even though we have much greater bandwidth today.
Thank you Bill Joy for still being engaged in today's world as are your
counterparts Ken and Rob, but I respectfully disagree.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="LEUXI3I_IZg" %}

vi is a gift from the tree of knowledge.

And I am not the beast.

I advocate partaking of the gifts of knowledge you have given us. Don't talk
smack about vi. I would like to use it to blow up on YouTube without following
the beast's path. I'll say it again, and I'll say it once more:

vi, vi, vi

# Don't Take It Too Seriously, Saint IGNUcius

This has been a short story and is not at all meant to be taken seriously,
folks. Just let some knowledge and fun sink into your brain through osmosis.
There really is no connection between vi and the beast.

But just in case you feel your soul needs cleansing, there's always Saint
IGNUcius.

# Python Is The Sheep In Wolf's Clothing

Yes, Guido van Rossum represents the linear yang vim-user in all of us, over
say the yin emacs-users such as Paul Graham. But how could this be if Guido
programmed Python in emacs as user... [which one of you informed me?]. So how
can that be? Python is actually a yin language in yang clothing. That's why
such a soft, round, blue programming language is named ***Python***. It is soft
blue tool for doing sharp green things. It's simply inexpressible so must be
misrepresented to slip into your mind while your guard is down.

The red pill is blue inside... sorry, folks. You've been infected.

Show the nice people Robin Williams' Throbbing Python of Love. Think Robin's
Green or Red? No! Robbin's as blue as it gets. *POOF* what do you need? But
gentle spirits must protect themselves with humor and attack.

# The Yin & Yang Comedians of SNL / Yins Check Out

Want green? Look at Chevy Chase. Look at Dennis Miller. Look at Andrew Dice
Clay. They're so green they bleed sap.

# Abba Di Abba Di.

- Green Lantern is true Green. Hal Jordan is a test pilot.
- Green Arrow is blue in Green clothes. Oliver Queen hates space guns.

# Regarding T-Shirt Reveals & Poems

- Yesterday, I was still the wolf.
- Today, I am still Green Lantern.
- When one discusses Green Lantern, one does not ***need*** to make up poetry.

This is NOT my original poetry:

> In brightest day, in blackest night<br />
> No evil shall escape my sight<br />
> Let those who worship evil's might<br />
> Beware my power, Green Lantern's light!<br />

This IS my original poetry:

# A Tale of Two Tony's

> There was a Tony who taught me<br />
> Amiga was Unix most motley<br />
> The DCCU until Tony two<br />
> I'm group-thinking bad<br />
> But was ***not***... see!<br />

People who switch tools easily have the same quality as those folks who take up
second and third languages (in later years) easily.

This is not as easy as such folks project. They probably don't even know how
others (like me) struggle with a 2nd language, much less a 3rd, 4th and 5th
on-demand, and sometimes only just to stand still in the field, stay relevant
and not go obsolete.

The vibe you're born with by birth comes from 22 bundles of features, each
bundle contributed by either your mother or your father.

This is where the "23" in the company name 23&Me comes from. Wait! That's 23...
not 22. The 23rd gene bundle, a.k.a. chromosome, is that XY thing that
determines your hardware (sex). The prior 22 are mostly your traits you're born
with. That is not you. That is a suggested starting point, provided by... words
fail. Refer to Hitchhikers Guide to the Universe, Improbability Engine.

From somewhere around age 6 to let's say 16 (a 10-year window), you go meta.
Many creatures go meta. You know it by their ability to demonstrate symbolic
thought. Monkeys knowing where bananas are from being shown in a model of a
room. Monkeys too think, therefore they are. So what makes our 10-years of
going meta different from monkeys? Nuance and subtlety. More meta. More ability
to actualize real-world things... be creative and allow the fruits of that
creativity to go through your digestive track and have the seeds pop out your
butt with the fertilizer those seeds need to take root and grow.

Lunder (poo)

This is NOT my original poetry:

# Litany Against Fear from Dune

Litany Against Fear, found in the Dune SciFi series.

> I will not fear.<br />
> Fear is the mind-killer.<br />
> I will face my fear.<br />
> I will let it pass through me.<br />
> When the fear has gone,<br />
> there shall be nothing.<br />
> Only I will remain.<br />

Again, no matter what movies you've watched and how much you think you know
Dune, you do not unless you read the books, all of them by Frank Herbert AND
the ones by his son and ghost writer.

"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind."

# Green Lantern Movie was good because

- Ryan Reynolds
- Loyalty to original GL Story (360 wedges of galactic police)
- The Computer Graphics
- The stereotypical "father gets killed" comic book trope
- It's one of the best comic book movies as a genre model
  - As good as Iron Man 1.
- It captures the "Emotional color" nuance of GL

    GREEN IS NATURAL HUNTERS
    WHILE NOT TERRIBLY CREATIVE
    GREEN PLUS CREATIVITY IS POWER
    THE DELIBERATE AUTONOMOUS CREATIVE WILL
    OF LIVING THINGS... THAT'S THE ESSENCE
    OF GREEN (LIFE, CHLOROPHYLL, BRANCHES & LEAVES)

There are other "essential" energies that can be tapped, and each has its own
strengths and weaknesses. And some are as two-edged as you may imagine, like
Red.

- Red is passion and anger and therefore negative... yes, when unchecked.
- But also love and intensity and determination.

This double-edgedness of red and how beings of power and passion are powerful
but not necessarily evil is a recurring theme in literature. For example, Smaug
the dragon in The Fellowship Of The Ring.

Another recurring theme you will find is that the acceptance of differeing sort
of beings and an embracing of the diversity of life "as good" and a source of
strength, versus hegemony and hegemonies and sameness as an opposing source of
strength. As a Jew this has very special significance to me, and it's only
because of the diversity of the Allied forces and the "others" of the German
population defecting that they prevailed so decisively over the Axis-powers who
valued sameness, racial purity and a master race. Eff them. Thank you Turing
and Einstein, first for winning quietly by breaking codes, and then again for
winning with a big boom pronouned that it's probably better to love and embrace
the Jews of in your land instead of trying to exterminate them, because you
never know what sort of plauge of mircacles my reign down upon your head.

# Cats are Assholes

So of course in Science Fiction, there are lizard-based races that lack the
emotional nuance and subtlety of colony mammals because colony mammals are born
more vulnerable. SciFi doesn't stop at lizards for the horrific alien contact
stories. Both the Kzin of Larry Niven's Known Space Ringworld comes to mind, as
do the Maxolhx of Craig Alanson's Expeditionary Force (Skippy & Joe Bishop)
series.

- Cat-based races
- Cats in general
- Cats are a regression to ambush predator strategies... Reptilian strategies.
- Ambush predation is a good strategy.
- I am the bush. Am-bush. Croods cartoon
- Cold blooded animals have no choice

# Are All Reptiles Ambush Predators?

- Not all reptiles are ambush predators.
- Veggie-eating turtles... round... shielded... armor.
- Are all turtles ***not*** ambush predators?
- No, alligator snapping turtles have reverted

Turtles are evolved reptiles... trying out less ambushy strategies... trying
more to be like mamals... But using the tactics of bugs. Calcium.

Life templates... can be tried out... through deliberate life processes... not
just random mutation.

# Epigenetics / Mind Over Matter Directs Evolution

The other Michael Levin... please watch.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="XheAMrS8Q1c" %}

Epigentics is a new science but is rapidly establishing how electrical
blueprints can orchestrate life. This sounds a lot like thinking yourself into
being a better being.

# So What About Me Blowing Up On YouTube?

Criss-cross verification... is what you're talking about TRUE? And as important
as it seems? Provide evidence... Different ways and through different medias.

- YouTube (embedded URLs of findable paged)
- Google-findable web pages (embedded YouTube)
- Parenthood, good examples & positivity
- 4th Circle of Ikigai, What The World Needs... So do some good
- Free energy and the wise and fair application
  - This is the most privileged time in all human history
  - All decisions every made by humanity pale in comparison to the ones coming
- State of mind transitions and the exercised thereof
- Baby-steps... Nothing is a project. It's just "things"

If pessimists were right, you wouldn't be here to hear this video.

# What Next?

- Just publish so much
- So frequently
- On so many topics
- That is of so much interest
- To so many people
- Over so many channels
- Connecting with so many people
- In such a generous way

# Conclusion & Prescience

I shot my livecast for today. It was a good one. I'm very happy with it. It was
my best video ever, in fact. Almost 2 hours. Doing these videos in the car is
like athletes practicing on the top of mountains where the air is thin, then
coming back down to the oxygen-rich air of sea-level. It's the same as with all
those years of walking the dog in New York City. No matter what turns of events
in life steal the time from your day and the oxygen from your lungs, you can
navigate the impossible route... become the worm.
