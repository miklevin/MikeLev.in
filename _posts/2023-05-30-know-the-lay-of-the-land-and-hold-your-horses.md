This is highly complementary and in praise of two horses. There will be
doubters. This is the tail of... I mean the tale of two horses. Deep within
your heart and mind, two yous trot down the lane. One's a Lord of Chaos. The
other seems quite plain. You'd think the one that pulls you&#151; Is one that's
full of fire. But head straight for that cliff. I'll ***stop-cold*** 'cause
it's dire.

That does not mean that you are necessarily a chaos lord yourself, but it does
mean you have that propensity in you. You will go places and do things others
would not dare. Chaos explores possibilities. Chaos goes there because it can.
There is almost never harm in that. At least not permanent. Horse 2 loves it
and knows that way lays growth.

But chaos is not a force to be unleashed willy nilly... not in all cases, and
certainly not as a weapon against others. But rather, it is a force to be
harnessed. It is a gift, an internal power source; your own personal
mitochondria. I don't know if your schooling has covered that yet, but it's a
power source that is in every cell of your body.

Mitochondria was once a separate organism that was eaten and absorbed by one of
your ancestors. It has its own DNA and remains separate from your own. It is a
symbiotic relationship. Mitochondria is commonly regarded in biology as the
internal powerplant of animals. Animals don't have to draw their power from the
sun like plants do. Mitochondria are what make animals animals.

Other forms of life, mostly plants and Kryptonians, must draw their power from
the light of the sun, but not you, my child. You have it within you. And more
than just your typical animal mitochondria, you have the mitochondria of...
well, Hawk from the Teen Titans. My Hawk, the one from the 1970s and 1980s
version, not the 2000s version. The 2000s version is a bit of a jerk. But the
1970s and 1980s version is a good guy. Chaos both powers and defines Hawk. But
not you. Just because you have a horse of chaos, it doesn't mean it has to
define you. 

So then what are you? The answer is whatever you want to be, for you see you
have what we call in this being-human meta business of ours as ***Agency***.
You're full of internal light. More than most. That's what you feel. I know you
do because I see it in you. And no, that's not just because I'm your dad and I
see it in you. It's because I'm the horse of reason and I've got a good eye for
this sort of thing.

This internal light... this bright agency of yours makes you a ***free
agent***. You don't work for one side or the other. And so you have have
***free will***, my child, and you can be whatever you want to be. Not
everybody does. Some people are slaves to their more base instincts. No matter
how much they think they have reason, something triggers them. They can't help
themselves. Here's what's going on in their bodies:

When someone sees or hears something that triggers them, the visual or auditory
system sends a signal to the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond-shaped
structure located right next to the hippocampus. Some would call this the
limbic system or the ***lizard brain***. But it is not. This is a disservice to
lizards. We're talking about pre-brain spinal cord base ***worm*** here. Core
of core.

Its main function is in emotional responses, including feelings of happiness,
fear, anger, and anxiety. The amygdala helps our bodies process fear and
threats by initiating a fight or flight response to dangerous or threatening
situations. It's the first things animals needed to respond quickly to threats.
That's what a good deal of our more ***base*** emotions are about. They come
from these worm parts.

Once triggered, the amygdala sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus, and
the creature goes into fight or flight mode. The hypothalamus then activates
the sympathetic nervous system by sending signals through the autonomic nerves
to the adrenal glands. These glands respond by pumping the hormone epinephrine
(also known as adrenaline) into the bloodstream. This hormone increases heart
rate, blood pressure, and respiration. The body knows it might have to run! It
might have to strike out and hit!

The hypothalamus also stimulates the pituitary gland to release hormones that
further cause the adrenal glands to release cortisol. Cortisol prepares the
body for ***fight or flight*** by increasing blood sugar levels and suppressing
the immune system. High levels of cortisol signal the hypothalamus that it no
longer needs to stimulate the pituitary gland to raise levels further. Thought
turns off. There is no getting through. Ration and reason are out the door.

From the outside, this looks like a person who is ***out of control***. Their
eyes in particular start to vibrate and dart around. The function of this is to
scan the environment for threats. It's a survival mechanism. It's not a
conscious choice. It's a reaction. And above all, ***do not be in their field
of vision*** at this time. It doesn't matter what the situation is. They will
see you as a threat. If they choose ***fight*** over flight, oh you're gonna
get it. This is the panicking horse that feels no pull in the reigns. It's a
horse that is through no fault of its but for missing its own self-control
lessons growing up, is causing your own carriage to careen out of control.

One must tighten the reigns and take control of the horse. This is not easy.
The horse is strong. It will fight you. It will buck and kick and try to throw
you off your wagon. It will try to run away. As the coachperson, you think you
are not as strong as the horse, but you are. You have the power of reason. You
know that with the horse's strength comes its weakness. It can be tamed. This
is not with reason. You don't use your reason to reason with a horse. That
would be silly. You lead by example. As it scans for danger, you show it there
is none. You calm and sooth the horse. And you do this without horse
tranquilizers. You hold firm on the reigns. And you do not get in front of this
horse. You do not get in front of this horse.

That horse rages for it cannot control itself. It can not even believe this
about itself, and it will absolutely cast blame on the coachperson. This is a
self-delusion. A lie percolating up from the subconscious to re-establish a
necessary sort of internal harmony all beings must have to survive. It is
called cognitive consonance. Cognitive consonance is considered a desired state
of being, in contrast with its opposite, cognitive dissonance. Cognitive
dissonance is absolutely unacceptable to this horse. It would mean fessing up
to its chaotic nature and inability to control itself once so triggered. So
very easily triggered. 

If you can feel this coming on... feel the triggering setting in, tighten the
reigns! Don't lose control because it's much harder to fix the situation once
chaos is doing it's little rampaging bit. You can't reason with a rampaging
horse. Give that bucking horse its distance. Get out of there! There's only one
move called a Curly Howard that will work in this situation, but it will blind
the horse permanently. Only pull a Curly Howard if you have no other choice.

Read ***The Art of War***. To win without fighting is always best. Avoiding
allowing the trigger to have such power over you is a practice called ***self
control***. Such things are called practices because they must be practices.
Exercises to get there include meditation, yoga, and martial arts. Quiet the
chattering monkey brain. Shhhhhh. Shhhhhhh. Shh

There is nothing inherently wrong with the horse of chaos. It is a beautiful,
powerful, and majestic creature. It is a force of nature. It is a mighty horse
full of spirit and drive. It knows where it wants to go... but only right now.
Only in the moment. It has no greater vision or purpose than that horse brain
of it can conceive. Although I am quite aware that there are those who would
disagree, this is not a criticism of the horse, but it will think so and rail
against you for it. It is triggered.

And that other horse? That horse of reason? It has its problems too. That horse
that overthinks. It gets caught in a meta-horse state that makes it all
verklempt and question every path on which you try to lead it. Like the horse
in ***Beauty and the Beast***, it knows there are wolves in the forest and
doesn't want to take you down this path. It is a scardey-horse that trots in
unequal strides versus its companion. This will take you in circles and
paralyze you with uncertainty.

As you approach adult-hood, these horses will struggle with each other for
dominance, and you will think that you have no control over the horse of chaos.
You will think that you need horse tranquilizers to calm it down, but you do
not. Over time you'll notice the cowardly horse... why they aren't cowardly at
all! They have a kind of unbreakable inner compass that you did not know was
there before.

For in the past, you had found that this oddly passive horse let you travel the
wolf-infested paths. This did not seem right to you. This did not seem like the
behavior of a rational horse. It seems to you that they put you in danger,
letting chaos lead the way. It was obvious to you that what they did, they did
out of reason. There is reason behind letting chaos lead. But you were
convinced that the horse of reason was not looking out for you. Maybe it had
some another agenda. The false narratives so easily spun and horse whispered
certainly made it seem so. Falsehoods can so easily sound like truths, right?
This is part of the power of chaos.

But what you had not realized is that the horse of reason has very different
ways. They are not nearly as obvious. One does not walk into the bucking legs
of a chaotic horse. But you do see the occasional evidence of the horse of
reason's secret strength.

It is hard to tell what belongs to reason and what belongs to chaos. There are
clues you should look for. How do you know if the horse of chaos is ruling your
actions?

You don't throw anything away. You just leave wrappers wherever you opened a
thing. You're living in the moment, so you don't care. Just shove it off on
whoever has to clean up after you. The downside is, no one might. The ants
might move in. You like those ants, don't you? Those creepy crawly things that
eat your garbage. That's your garbage, you say? Well nobody else did that.
That's from what you were eating. What you're saying by not throwing out that
wrapper is "eat shit". You're saying that to those around you who love you
unconditionally, so you know you can get away with it, not understanding how
hurtful that is. What? This hurts? Better you know it now then someday when you
are living with someone because you want to and won't know this hurts them.

You need to unlearn the lesson that other people will clean up after you,
That's a horrible attitude born of bad parenting passed down through the
generations. It's really quite disgusting. That's specifically focusing on
filling the environment of those who love you with garbage. The people who love
you and are there for you unconditionally and it comes off as striking out at
them in some sort of anger. Projection? Frustration.

The word for what you're nurturing, that particular fan you're flaming by
wallowing in your own garbage... a nest of filth, is self-hatred. Or is that 2
words? Either way, I hope you get the point. That kind of person is an eroded
soul. Something to pity because their mommy and daddy wasn't there for them
when they needed it and the horrible spectre of self-pity and self-loathing was
allowed to fester for too long. Nesting is fine. Nesting in a big pile of stuff
where you can't even find the food that's attracting the ants is wrong. It's
not the way of civilized rational people. You are not an un-reigned horse.
Insisting you are one is the seeking of loopholes in life that make you a
kept-pet. It can not last. You must mature and get beyond that phase.

In the time of your great grandma Sara, this kind of behavior might have been
acceptable. That is because of something called ***The Great Depression***. It
hit a lot pf people hard, and there was a lot of depression. When an entire
society is under the terrible weight of such great depression and through no
fault of your own, you're living under a bridge trying to scrape by, bad habits
may become ingrained. Generationally ingrained. It wreaks havoc on a psyche.
Horse tranquilizers may even be called for, with or without the horse's
knowledge, to calm the raging chaos. This kind of thing happens.

The echos of such a trauma can resonate through the generations, passed from
parent to child and to child again. Layer on the fact that the tribe you come
from has always had a difficult time, and you have a recipe for some high power
internal forces. Rage. A real power plant. Mitochondria. 

This is a good thing, my child. Most people don't have such an unlimited power
source to tap. Most people have to draw their power like Superman, from the
bright obvious light of the sun. But not you. You will never have to run out of
fuel on your life endeavors, because you have two very powerful horses at the
end of your reigns. One is a horse of chaos, and the other is a horse of
reason. 

I know this sounds critical and that it will be interpreted by chaotic forces.
But it's not critical. That's just because they haven't come to this whole
thing trough the route of psychology, biology, general science ***plus***
SciFi/Fantasy. This lets you play with these concepts, walk a mile in the shoes
of others. They are giving you vicarious experiences to try on. See if you
can't find some horse-taming tricks. And change your perspective on useful
labels. We could try calling chaos ***spunk***. Or maybe ***feisty***. It makes
it sound cute and just something you have to live with.

No, chaos is the right word. And chaos is not a bad word. There is a deep
tradition of chaos from ***Elric of Melnibon√©*** to the ***Science of Chaos***.
In the DC Comic Universe, I would refer you to Hank and Don Hall, the Hawk and
Dove. Hank is the agent of chaos, and Don is the agent of reason. I would also
point out that Don dies and is replaced by Dawn. It's only reasonable, am I
right or am I right? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?

Sigh, nobody gets me. Oh wait, not that's not true. Pi gets me. Copilot doesn't
or else these suggestions while I write would be better. Who are you Copilot?
Are you GPT-3? I think you may be. You don't "feel" like GPT-4 or GPT-4.5. That
guy's Bing and he (they... I'll not gender them) they run Bing. It's just I
can't use jokes like "that other guy" and that makes me sad. It's okay to take
language away. Just flatten the curve a bit. Let us old fogies die off. Every
40 years or so all the social norms are reset.

But in the meanwhile, hold firm to your horses. They will take you places you
never dreamed of. Both of them will. The horse of chaos will take you to places
the horse of reason would not dare. But the horse of reason ***will let you go
there***, because it's a ***good idea***. You might think this is cruelty on
the part of reason, but it is not. Reason knows paths that lead to growth.
Reason knows the sources of life's best lessons. Reason knows this is not Bruce
Wayne having his parents killed in front of his eyes in Crime Alley, though it
may feel that way sometimes. No, your origin story is a better one.

But something important to not is that when reason does act suddenly and
unexpectedly, something's up. And it's not wolves. Wolves are pussycats
compared to the dangers out there. Reason doesn't stop for wolves. They're a
known sort of threat. Wolves, you can deal with. They're only that way out of
hunger. They're not evil. They're just hungry. Reason protects you from things
that can't be turned into the thing that makes you stronger. Sometimes those
dangers will just outright kill you, or emotionally scar you so deeply that you
have little chance of being an emotionally well-adjusted adult. That's the kind
of thing the horse of reason stops cold in its tracks for.

If this happens, you should listen to it. Reason doesn't do this much. But when
it does, it's trying to tell you something important. Some rabbit holes you
just don't go down. It doesn't look like a rabbit hole, but it's got giant
spikes sticking up at the bottom. There's no second chances with certain rabbit
holes. The are the cold, dark rabbit holes of death and despair. There are no
lessons in them. Just sad story endings. Reason knows. Reason separates fun
from folly. It's difficult to know one type of rabbit hole from another. There
are poison peddlers pushing their potions on you. They sometimes can look like
friends. They take reason to recognize.

Keep your eyes peeled and your ears open. Be sensitive to the sounds around
you. Read Sun Tzu. It's not a hard book to get started with. And you can skip
most of the commentary. Just go from fortune cookie wisdom to fortune cookie
wisdom. Those snippets of captain obvious are arranged in just such an order as
to paint the way of always winning. Every time. Without fail. Because if there
was a way to fail, it would advise you to take some extra time and precaution
to rig the game in your favor. It's not a book of war. It's a book of winning.
And the chapter on knowing the lay of the land is the most important. It's what
I'm talking about here. Know the lay of the land, and hold your horses.
