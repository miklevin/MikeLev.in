title: Hands-on With Moz Products & Clarification of What's What
headline: Exploring Moz Products & Making a Big Impact in My Fourth Week at Moz
description: I am currently in my fourth week as a Moz employee, and I am learning about the various products they offer. I am using the Free SEO Tools to test the boundaries of the free product, exploring Moz Local, Moz Pro, Free SEO Tools, and Resources, as well as the MozBar Premium and the Links API V1 & V2. I am documenting my progress and thoughts on my public blog, and publishing videos on YouTube to reduce fear and create consistency.

I'm in week 4 at Moz.

Finally started an account on moz.com and walked through the intro. I learned
about the accordion user interface on the left side. I plugged in a few test
keywords to test longtail specific venn intersections versus single-words from
same list. Checking the boundaries, such as it were. Granularity, resolution,
stuff like that.

We are going to apply the Moz tools to:

- 1 or more of my personal sites
- Possibly Moz.com itself

I will learn the various products.

So there's the Free Product, just login and start doing keyword research. A lot
of value for free, really. Especially since AdWords became more stingy with
data. The mere fact you need an AdWords account and campaign in there to use
AdWords Keyword tools is a factor pushing people to less committal tools, like
free versions.

The idea there is certainly to start a relationship. Later on, it may lead to
paying customer. Better there then PPC. What are the options once logged in?

- Moz Local
- Moz Pro
- Free SEO Tools
- Resources

There are navigation-less, yet still logged-in "modes" like the homepage.

I currently am on Free SEO Tools with my work email address. I will ask for
that to be comped, but not until after I get familiar with the boundaries of
the free product. Feel out to the edges. Know how much you can do with the free
product. Make that part of your Free and Open Source SEO Software pitch. Even
though these are proprietary sources of data, we use them. Our software is
still FOSS. We are completely allowed to import data from proprietary sources
like Moz. Here's some you can "export free" from the Web UI of the Free SEO
Tools level of service. Let's explore that first. See what we can do without
paying, then keep fleshing it in for folks who want to go pro.

Internalize this:

https://moz.com/products

- Entry-level is the "Free SEO Tools"
- If you're doing local SEO, there's a $15/mo product.
- If you're upping your "Free Tools" game, there's $99/mo Moz Pro.
- If you have lots of SERPs to track, there's Stat starting at $720/mo.

There are additional APIs offered, each with their own pricing tiers.

There's Moz Academy, which is How to use Moz Pro
https://academy.moz.com/how-to-use-moz

The API, around which the language varies, has multiple pricing tiers:

- $250 per month for 120,000 rows-per-month
- $500 per month for 500,000 rows-per-month
- $2,000 per month for 4,000,000 rows-per-month
- $10,000 per month for 40,000,000 rows-per-month

All this API-stuff is for what's called Mozscape sometimes, but when you look
at the API documentation, you see the "new language" that goes:

- Links API V1 & V2
- Please use V2, but we won't retire V1
- Look for consistency issues between the two systems.

Do a project with the MozBar in the immediate term. Let's do it!

- Try doing something Immediate-term with MozToolbar
- Find some immediate-term edits to help the clarity on https://moz.com/help/links-api

There's a MozBar Premium! https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar

logged in.

My default is going to be to type in here in my "Secret" public blog. I do it
for thinking out loud, for purposes of commitment and consistency, per Robert
Cialdini. Oh, I have to talk to Bing and ChatGPT about influence and persuasion
sometime!

Anyhow, I just feel more comfortable getting my thoughts out there for the
world to see. Maybe it's a bit about ego, but it's also very self-affirming and
motivating. It makes me compel things to the next step and the next step and
the next step that are sometimes very difficult to compel.

But I'm new on the Moz team and I feel like I was born for this opportunity and
I want to make a big impact... but not too fast. Ease into it. But not too
slow. Do it just right. And gathering data is such an important first step.

Okay, don't make false dependencies on all this, don't make busy-work, and
don't dilly dally nor get distracted too much besides that familiarity you need
to get with the chatbots. But be careful the rabbit holes there are deep.
Merely identify those rabbit holes for evaluation.

How "From Scratch" do you want to do everything? You have your "practice" and
even your "practice_save" folders under your repos root, but do you want
another fresh starting point. pipulate/repos/seoz ?

Okay the video I recorded looking at Moz with fresh eyes is published Moz-side
YouTube. It's really interesting that I can publish with that sort of
organizational privacy under GSuite. I'm going to use that really well.

Okay, reduce the fear by repeatedly pushing out these Moz-only YouTube videos
as sort of the practice-runs which are still share-able. It's a very good
compromise, commitment & consistency but only visible within Moz.
