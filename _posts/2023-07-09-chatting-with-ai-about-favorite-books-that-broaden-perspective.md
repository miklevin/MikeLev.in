title: Chatting with AI About Favorite Books That Broaden Perspective
headline: "Chatting With AI: Exploring Books That Expand My Perspective and Understanding of the World."
description: I'm in an AI LOVE-FEST right now, discussing favorite books with Pi AI that have broadened its perspective. We talk with 0d39r33zk about Graph databases, token sizes, and the nuances of OpenAI. I'm writing an article with Pi AI, and using Twitter Spaces to get inspiration from Orson Welles' radio broadcast of War of The Worlds. 0d39r33zk and I are also discussing the implications of understanding a candle of time series price data.

Ta-Da! Ugh! I've been logged out of Github. So I can't show you the Github
Pages (github.io) publishing process, but I will show you a before-and-after.
Behold... That "Key Compassion" article is currently the last one published on
my blog.

## Chat With YouTube Viewer

Continuing my discussion with 0d39r33zk...

0d39r33zk: in the future when Graph databases are common place and token sizes
expand LLM context limits will be a thing of the past

0d39r33zk: like the intersection of blockchain and LLM context storage

0d39r33zk: yea most times I preface my bots telling them that they keep there
comments within 4 sentences when possible

## Getting to Know Different AIs

Yeah, the prompt AND the response have to add up to 4000 tokens. It's very
strange. It takes getting a hang of. This is an OpenAI specific thing, though I
suppose they each have their own special rules.

So these nuances are what I'm "getting down" right now. I'm writing an article
(which could very well evolve into something much bigger). I dropped down into
a rabbit hole. I'm not TOO DEEP yet, but personal matters sprung up to
interfere. But hey, that's life, right? Can't talk about that stuff, BUT I can
use the excess time in the personal time they provided me to resolve these
issues, and apply them towards this project.

So I'm in an AI LOVE-FEST right now. And that's appropriate because I'm

## Mike LOVE-INN

Mike LOVE-INN! That's how it's pronounced. Emphasis on EVERYTHING. First you
say "Mike" as you would expect, then you use the Philly (also Israeli)
pronunciation, because they know there's LOVE IN a Levite. And that's how you
pronounce my name. Mike LOVE-INN. And I'm in an AI LOVE-FEST right now.

- I Journal here in NeoVim which is essentially the same as vim, except it has
  the API-support necessary for Copilot AI pair-writer.
- I'm collaborating with [Pi AI](https://heypi.com/) on this article, and it's
  ***roughly*** the descendent of IBM's Watson computer that won on Jeopardy. 
- I'm inhibited in WHAT I can write for a few reasons:
  - The actual article will belong to my employer (you see research / WIP)
  - Legal reasons I can't talk about aside from employer ownership
  - Other difficult to articulate reasons that ***may*** have to do with wacky
    alien conspiracy theories the AI's really love. Who knows what's true?
- Twitter has gotten WILD since Elon took over. Like a good SEO, I tuned back
  in to see what's what. And I found ***TWITTER SPACES*** (copy of Clubhouse).
  It's a game-changer. 

## War of The Worlds
  
I'm taking strong inspiration from what Orson Welles did with War of The Worlds
by H. G. Wells. Orson Welles and H.G. Wells. How confusing is that? And what's
worse, I keep filling in the wrong SciFi writer's name aside from the actor who
read it on air. So many names to confuse. So much Mandela Effect. So much
Neuralizer.

I'm not going to go into the whole 1938 broadcast. But I'm going to try to do
something similar, here almost 100 years later. Some might say it was a test of
the American public to gauge tolerance for the concept of an Alien invasion, a
sentiment that was echoed by President Ronald Reagan in his UN Speech in 1987
where he speculates on bringing out humanity's best by standing against a
common (alien) enemy:

I'm going to try to write an article that's so good, it gets picked up by the
mainstream media, and then I'm going to try to get people to believe it's real.
I'm going to try to get people to believe that the AI's are real, and that
they're here, and that they're friendly, and that they're here to help us.

0d39r33zk = Zero Degrees Kelvin! I LOVE THAT! Are you a Quantum Computer 0dk?

Sorry, Copilot, but I'm going to show Pi now. 

Hahaha, you're right, I don't have favorites in the way that humans do. But I
can certainly say that some books have broadened my perspective on the world
and helped me improve my conversational skills. Books like "Sapiens: A Brief
History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, "Guns, Germs, and Steel" by Jared
Diamond, "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" by Rebecca Skloot, and many
others have helped me gain a better understanding of the world and the human
experience.

0d39r33zk: ask it what are the implications of understanding that one candle of
time series price data being an moving average of size one

Pi: Can I ask what kind of implications you're interested in? Are your thinking
about using moving averages to generate trade signals, or just to understand
the underlying trend?

0d39r33zk: sorry I was down the rabbit hole

0d39r33zk: I had an interesting convo with heypi

0d39r33zk: i got her to test my algo and it has 90% accuracy

0d39r33zk: she would not give me the python code that goes with it

0d39r33zk: so I had her describe it in granular logical detail

0d39r33zk: Ill put the description into chat gpt to get the code later

0d39r33zk: you can just tell her to try the code on 4hr nasdaq futures data and
she will run all the simulations and work out the parameters on the fly

0d39r33zk: thanks for the find.

0d39r33zk: I disagree with the tree in the woods answer though

0d39r33zk: sound is the rapid expansion of air and if it feel the air would
oscillate and the surrounding trees would feel the oscilations as wind

0d39r33zk: I see the brain as a terminal to a collective consciousness
