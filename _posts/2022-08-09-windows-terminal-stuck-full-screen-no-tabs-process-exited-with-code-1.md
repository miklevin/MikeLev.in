title: Windows Terminal Stuck Full-Screen, No Tabs & process exited with code 1
headline: I Found the Solution to my Windows Terminal Stuck in Full-Screen Mode!
description: Having encountered an issue with my Windows Terminal getting stuck in full-screen mode with no tabs, I tried Alt+F4 to close the window, but to no avail. I then discovered that Microsoft had changed the forced-close shortcut to Ctrl+Shift+W. I'm sharing my experience to help others who may have the same issue, and explain why Microsoft chose to keep the fullscreen shortcut as Function+F11.

Press Ctrl+Shift+W to force the window to close. This replaces the ancient
Alt+F4. Why Microsoft changed a forced-close to Ctrl+Shift+W while they kept
the fullscreen keyboard shortcut as Function+F11 is a mystery. I'm guessing
that locked-up Windows Terminals happen so often that the Microsoft programmer
in charge of it decided to give it an easy-to-press keyboard shortcut.
