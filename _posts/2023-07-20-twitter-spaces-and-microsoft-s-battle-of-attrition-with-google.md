Okay, visualize then rapidly achieve. I was so separated from the world for so
many years of my life. No excuses! It's what I chose for myself. We all choose
our priorities in life, and if you're starved for affection and attention
because your parents were shitty, you can fall victim to the first person who
comes along and gives you a little bit of attention.

I was new in New York City. I was... YES! The timeline accounting for
everything in my life, play-by-play, extracted from my various journals. I can
get all the stuff the lawyer is going to ask about tomorrow ready and in order.
Play by play. Make my story read like a... well, a story I have a very
interesting story indeed. I lead and continue to lead a very interesting life.

I have been having a blast on Twitter Spaces. A lot of people credit Elon for
Twitter Spaces, congratulating him on making something so cool and so fast
after he took over, but in reality it was around since 2020. Twitter Spaces has
been around through the entire pandemic. It's just that Elon has been
participating in it, and that's what's making it so popular. Also some user
interface tweaks have really surfaced it. 

And it's funny because up until recently, I thought Twitter was for idiots. I
thought it was a cesspool of the worst humanity had to offer, mostly because
condensing your thoughts into 140 characters or less is not a good way to
communicate. It forces miscommunication. It forces over-simplification and
rewards the most bombastic and absurd statements. 

But Twitter Spaces is different. It's a voice chat room that you can join and
leave at will. All that nuance and detail I so crave and which usually only
comes across in long-form media, for which so many people these days seem to
have so little patience for, is there in Twitter Spaces. It's like town halls.
I mean it's not without its problem, and you have to follow the right people.
There are good hosts and co-hosts and there are bad ones. There are good spaces
and there are bad ones. When you find a good one, it's like a good party but
with news and information and a lot of people who are very smart and very
interesting.

I bring up all this Twitter stuff, because Twitter played such a big role in my
time in New York City, me being relegated to a "mere" 1,000 or so followers
while I saw people around me who knew how to "work" the Twidiots out there to
accounts of 100,000 or more followers. Of course it didn't make them one penny
and was not as important as holding down a job during all that time. And I did
much better in "long-form" media, such as YouTube, where I had a channel with
over 10K subscribers and several million views. And all that I really just did
to keep my foot in the door so I had first-hand experience with each platform
that could have a bearing on my actual job, SEO.

And of course now, SEO is in bigtime flux. The AIs are taking over there as
much as everywhere else, but with SEO in particular, entire companies are made
and broken overnight as traffic arbitrage gets reshuffled. The search engines
decide who gets what traffic (if at all) on what queries, searches, questions,
yadda yadda. Apple has a lot of ability to influence this in the US through
their 50% share control of the US smartphone market, but for many years they've
just been sending all that search traffic to Google to decide.

Google is very powerful. Their iPhone search dominance is reinforced by their
control over the entire Android platform. So on mobile right now, all roads
lead to Google. Never underestimate the power of the default search. All the
rest of the search traffic from other apps, sites or whatnot doesn't add up to
a fraction of what gets controlled by the "default" settings, because most
people don't change defaults. We change hardware too often to keep resetting
defaults. It's a battle of attrition.

Oh speaking of battles of attrition, Microsoft controls the desktop and still
has quite a bit of leverage. The browser wars have heated up again, and
entrances into Bing AI-search is replacing Cortana in the Windows Start Bar. So
even if you're 100% loyal to Google and keep re-installing Chrome, the
combination of having to have an Online Microsoft account to install Windows 11
and the forced-inclusion of Bing in the Start Menu, there's pretty much no
escaping Microsoft's attempt at a battle of attrition with Google.
