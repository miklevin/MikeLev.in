This is my first journal entry with Copilot turned on, haha! Is it going to
start suggesting stuff in a journal.markdown file that's 65K lines long. Let's
see what it tries to do. Nothing so far. Open another vim session to a .py file
and ensure that Copilot's really there. It is. There's going to be something
different about the environment.

I've also made the Microsoft Terminal window transparent so that my logo shows
through as I'm doing this sort of journaling. Wow is this going to change the
flavor of the videos. Check a smaller markdown file to see what Copilot does...

Watching this right now, courtesy of a friend and boss of recent years:

What am I going to do, haha! We are going to reach SciFi futures in my life.
Don't be scared. Live it, love it! Reduce frustration of not being able to do
what you've wanted to do. Project your imagination into the future.

Superpowers! I can draw already, but imagine how much better I'm going to be
able to draw with AI. Drawing, writing and all the creative stuff. And I don't
even have to worry about other people getting good at my thing, because I'm not
really that great at anything. Maybe the thing I'm good at is precisely this.

The thing I want to do is take those steps so that I don't lose my job and so
that the my share of the misery is less than the average. Societally we have a
lot of anger and doom we're going to go through, but we're going to get through
it, and things are going to re-balance.

Don't let the doom-and-gloomers get you down. They're just trying to tell you
how they feel about themselves deep inside, because they're not one of the ones
actively working to make the world better. Pessimism becomes self-fulfilling...
***for them***. Their pessimism is not self-fulfilling for me. My optimism is
self-fulfilling for me. The world's full of a shitload of reflections and a
shitload of people trying to sew their reflections onto you like Wendy sewing
on Peter Pan's shadow.

Okay, so the main thing is going to be to make your employer benefit profoundly
by having you on staff. Today was a good start. That compounding effect and
snowballing effect became more real because I visualized today's results and
actually did the Cialdini commitment and consistency trick and made it happen.

Do some profoundly valuable work. Make yourself invaluable.

Help others. Help others achieve their aspirational goals with your drinkme
script.

Hmmm, it's midnight. Get to sleep. But more important than anything else now is
plan out tomorrow to build upon today to get that snowball rolling and to get
the accumulating mass of your endeavor to compound.

Different approach than other people... differentiate yourself. No problem
there, LOL!

Provide an achievable aspirational path. Make it work for you and show other
people the way. Reach everyone and for those who balk at it and for whom it's
not for, don't worry. There will be plenty for whom it is.

And when it comes to your employer's customers, just make sure everything you
do drives more customers. Let the proof be in the pudding. And don't let other
people's fear about trying new things prevent you from showing others how to
try new things.

There are those who hang onto sinking ships because of fear and it's all they
know. Don't be one of them. If you find yourself on a sinking ship, slap on a
superpower suit and save some folks.

Care. Empathy. Creative problem solving. Indomitable spirit. And be Teflon as
the Gipper.
