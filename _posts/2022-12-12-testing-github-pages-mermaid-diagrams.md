description: I tested Github Pages Mermaid Diagrams to make sure my main homepage is up to date and optimized for SEO. My tests were successful, so I'm now able to add a mermaid diagram to my homepage. Plus, I found a page that documents the mermaid system. Read my blog post to find out how I used Github Pages and Mermaid Diagrams to improve my website.

Okay, what specific measures am I going to take now in light of Best Foot
Forward SEO? Well, the actual single one-and-only homepage address of a site is
even more important than ever. It's the one URL that will basically never
change. Hang as many signals as to what your site is about... what YOU are
about... off of that. Hmmm, I should make my homepage of MikeLev.in loaded
right along with my journals and .vimrc in my /usr/local/sbin/all script. Yes!
Maybe it will be 2nd to last.

Okay, I sudo vim'd my /usr/local/sbin/all program. I should be able to just
quit vim and reload it and my main site homepage will be my :blast file in my
buffer. I say :blast because that's the keyboard command that would bring me to
it, although :bl would do it just a well. But I find it a blast to :blast my
way to my most important file... wow, tested and it works. My main homepage
will be kept much more up to date than usual. I will indeed be putting my best
foot forward. I am no longer locked in that static state.

Let's get a simple mermaid diagram onto the homepage. First test it here using
the example from the github pages docs:

## Testing Mermaid Diagrams on Github Pages

```mermaid
graph TD
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

And this is another test...

```mermaid
graph TD
    MikeLev.in-->Linux;
    MikeLev.in-->Python;
    MikeLev.in-->vim;
    MikeLev.in-->git;
    MikeLev.in-->blog;
```

Here's the page that [documents the mermaid system](https://mermaid-js.github.io/)

Okay, the work
