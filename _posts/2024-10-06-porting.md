Just focus on the port. I finished `server.py` in the `botifython` repo for work
for the first of two special deliverable deliverers, and it's based on a bunch
of capabilities that I'm replacing with `pipulate.com`, namely how Websockets
and database persistence are done well as primary focuses of the `FastHTML`
framework and eliminates the needs for other ways I achieved those. The benefits
are staying within the FastHTML way of working are so huge especially early on
when this stuff is going to be copy/pasted a lot moving forward. Okay, deep
breath. 1, 2, 3... 1...

They're not the same filename, so pipulate its current form can be copied over
into botifython, and I should be able to `python filename.py` either of them,
and have them work out of the same folder just as well...

Okay, the first thing I really do is quit out of everything down to just this
blog article and the Mac desktop. Yeah, I'm going to do this port on the Mac. Or
am I? No, pull over everything to the Linux machine. Make sure Pipulate from
yesterday's pretty amazing state still runs over there. It wouldn't hurt to do a
Windows WSL test as well...
