There are those in life who have dynamic personalities, there are those in life
who have static personalities, and there are those in life who would have you
believe in false dichotomies. It's never black and white people. The solutions
to problems that aren't about pride and fear are shades of grey. Better still,
since our shades of grey metaphor has been ruined, there's a rainbow of
solutions in in there! What, we can't use rainbows generically either? Sheesh!
What's that? My favorite Rabbit Hole metaphor is tarnished now too Paramount+?
And we can't put a question mark after these stupid streaming names without it
looking stupid? Be dynamic, Mike. Be dynamic!

Okay, I lean static. I like my tools not changing for decades on end, even in
the field of technology, and yes that is realistic because vim & emacs. End of
story. Anyone promoting VSCode over them, talk to me in another fifty years and
we'll see where the Web UI is. The command-line interface will still be here.
It's what our robot overlords will use to boot themselves with. Yet, even this
static-advantage muscle memory stuff I love is to fade into the background so
that you can use all that excess capacity of your neo-cortex to do the real
dynamic work. When things change, you need to pay extra attention with you
***higher order*** mind. The part that thinks therefore it is. 

Yes, it's higher order, folks. Animals have a different kind of intelligence
but it didn't let them build the Internet and reach out to you with this
article. Human intelligence did. It's different, and it's higher order. It's
not better and maybe that's a language problem. But you see the problem with
shades of grey, rainbows? Same thing. If you've determined that you will
misinterpret, then you will misinterpret, but you know you're doing it, so that
makes it transparently disingenuous.

Bad guys aren't really bad. Their mommies and daddies, who themselves probably
weren't equipped or ready to be parents themselves, made them that way. It's
often through a series of classic mistakes:

- Over-sheltering them from learning things for themselves (fear)

Is there a second one? I don't know in this age of pandemic quarantines.
Everyone's a shut-in, so it's okay to be a shut-in yourself and raise your
children as shut-in's, rotting their brains with the social media and not
setting good examples by reading in front of them?

If you try to instill discipline by taking their phones away, lock your own
damn phones in a safe. Lead by example, people. Read in front of them. Better
still, write in front of them. Let them see you flipping open that laptop and
actualizing your thoughts onto "paper". Let them see you switch from one
computer to the next doing exactly the same thing, getting the point across
that matter doesn't matter. It's the information primarily inside your own head
that matters, and after that, the information that flows from machine to
machine. It's very spiritual and quite the cure for doomscrolling.

If you've been ruined by your folks, may I humbly suggest you watch someone
thinking out loud in vim. It doesn't matter if it's me or someone else. It
doesn't matter the subject-matter. It doesn't matter if it's just free-flowing
associative brainstorming or if it's a structured tutorial. 

It doesn't matter if it's poetry or prose... it doesn't matter if it's poetry
or prose... it doesn't matter if it's poetry or prose... fugue state coming
on... poetry must escape...

Me: Who is Snidely Whiplash and Who is that Other Guy Dasterdly?

Thank you, Bing! You are a true treasure-trove of wealth. I wonder if Google
will ever catch up, because you know I got on their Google Labs waiting list
for that thingie they announced last Wednesday at the Google I/O which seems to
be some sort of way of getting alternative revenue sources from the tanking of
AdWords clicks they're going to experience... Paid Inclusion 2.0. But I
digress... where was I? Oh yeah, in the flow... in the zone...

Ugh! That is just generic poetry, people. Find your help from inside first,
through writing and journaling. Survey the landscape. Dredge your subconscious.
As the astronomers used to say, you don't write it down, it didn't happen. Play
the observation game. Recognize attempts to recast reality as something
different. There is no Solla Sollew. Solutions to your troubles? They're all
within you.

But those solutions will not surface if you've committed yourself to your old
static ways. If you're not actively doing something to better yourself, you're
not working on solutions to "external" problems. There is no way I can express
in this book the power of that story, suffice to say that when you find
yourself projecting your own internal problems onto others, especially those
who can't defend themselves, take up lessons from Solla Sollew and ***inhibit
yourself***. I call it the Solla Sollew Uptake Inhibitor technique. It's much
more natural than the alternatives and won't interfere with the development of
your own self-regulation mechanisms at a critical time in your life.

You know, sometimes you are denied the chance to be involved in important life
decisions as expressly laid out, and you have to take matters into your own
hands. It's always best to explore options that are not as dramatic as what you
are capable of, given the situation and evidence. If someone evades the issue
every time it's brought up, make it an issue they can't evade. Some things are
important enough.

And even though Dr. Seuss cheated on his wife exposing his moral character
human weakness, ***and also*** even though such infidelity and betrayal is so
highly advertised and in your face these days given the state of our culture,
making it very hard to forgive him, let's try to cut Dr. Seuss a break. I think
you mike like to be cut the same slack if you were in his position.

The fact that Dr. Seuss drove his sick wife Hellen Palmer to suicide, just
reinforces the importance of doing the right thing when innocent bystanders are
at risk from your behavior.

Keep an open mind and open up ***I Had Trouble in getting to Solla Sollew***
and give it a read. Who knows, you might even find yourself reading it to your
kids.
