Okay, I have submitted my first 15Five report, haha! When I started out in this
biz, the lack-of accountability systems was like the biggest problem, because
the offenses could be as egregious as blowing off 10 perfectly reasonable
web-leads per-day coming in over the website and nobody would know. No matter
the emails or reports or personal pleas to the higher-ups, the problem was
incorrigible. I always got smiles and nods, but no action. So I turned the
mechanism that captured the sales leads into a message board system that
checked in with them to discuss how follow-up has been going. 

Of course all the prospective customers started answering back that they had
received no follow-up. I made a lead-assignment system so that the leads would
be assigned to the salespeople who could assign them out to dealers, value
added resellers, custom solution providers or whatever they were being called.
Every time a lead came in, it notified the company salesperson in that region
asking them to turn it into a direct sales opportunity or to assign it to a
reseller. Again, crickets. So you know what? I started assigning them to the
VARs myself. Boy was that a heady moment. I was wondering if I was going to get
fired.

But guess what? I didn't get fired, and I started receiving all kinds of
thanks from all over the world. I mean the names still just roll off my tongue
the friendships I made through this process. People like Ahmed Balfaqih and
Ahmed ElRidi who were just so appreciative and responsive, and whom I would
have never otherwise known. 

Ahmed told me I should turn it into a business because it's so useful and
they've never seen anything like it. I mean, Salesforce was a thing by then,
but this was a scrappy little version you could just throw onto a site. If you
took the whole thing, it was also the site's CMS, message board system, tech
support system, order management system and factory bill-of-materials system. I
could have been a contender (in the voice of Marlon Brando). 

I was like, no it's an internal system here at Scala and I'm happy here. But
alas, alas, I am such a dumbass. But I did make a lot of new friends.

This was maybe like 2002, a few years before I came to New York, realized I
wasn't just fixing a problem everyone wanted fixing but was actually running
afoul of the company's... I don't exactly know what to call it, but I was
starting to think it was criminal and started to raise concerns. That's when I
was told the company didn't really "have" to make sales. I was like "then why
did you bring me in for a percentage of company gross revenue?"

Shock.

I did not waste my great twenty-eights. I did not waste my great twenty-eights.
This was all worth it for the experience... for the experience... the journey
is the reward... the journey is the reward... if you haven't made it by now
you're never going to make it... if you haven't made it by now you're never
going to make it... reverberation... Resonance? Dissonance? Resonance?
Dissonance? Sour grapes or turn the other cheek?

This game has not played out.

Stan Lee! That is who this situation invokes in my head. Stan Lee was 49 years
old when he become the head of Marvel Comics. Now adjusting for the fact that I
am considerably less ambitious than Stan Lee and have little to no desire to
start my own company, my 52 years old is not too late at all to have some big
impact on the world.

I was knocked off the horse I came riding into New York on. It takes as many
years coming out of a situation to recover as it took going in. It's a shitty
rule of life, but I'm fairly convinced that's how the brain works. So the
sooner you act on something, the better. One of my biggest regrets in life is
that I lacked the energy to ***properly*** act on a certain situation sooner,
but now I think I shall.

Muster the courage. Take that lesson from Stan Lee. It' never too late to
become a superhero.
