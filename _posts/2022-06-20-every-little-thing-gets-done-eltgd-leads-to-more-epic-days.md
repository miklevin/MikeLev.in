title: Every Little Thing gets done (ELTgd) Leads to More Epic Days
headline: "ELTgd: Juneteenth 2022 - A Day of Accomplishment, Pleasure, and Self-Realization."
description: On Juneteenth of 2022, I had a productive day full of accomplishment and pleasure. I wrote a difficult letter to my ex, created a sub-arrow system for my Jekyll and GitHub Pages static site generator, enjoyed a hot bath and a meal at the local diner, interacted with my YouTube audience, and created one of my best videos ever. I was reminded that life is what we make of it, and that everything after a certain point is of my own choosing.

My precious time-off from work time on this Monday the Juneteenth of 2022 are
rapidly winding down. I pulled off some things I previously thought impossible
in my mind.

- I wrote the first draft of a very difficult letter to my ex concerning
  disturbing recent events that could also serve as a letter to my child
  explaining the current circumstances
- I got category arrows working as a sub-arrow system within my Jekyll and
  GitHub Pages static site generator system that sliced single page journals
  into a better Web experience
- I prevented all my emotional and mental energy from being flushed down the
  toilet as a result of circumstances beyond my control. I asserted a unique
  level of control over my own life I am normally reticent to do.
- I still got a long, hot relaxing bath in, one of the few great material
  pleasures of life available to use in a daily basis that's on par with the
  greatest in history. I'll throw in eating at the local Diner and listening to
  my SciFi Skippy the Magnificent Audible into this category.

I shit you not, this was a most excellent day. I've interacted with my YouTube
audience even though I have not livecast in a number of days. I pushed out one
of my best videos ever: This is the way the world is saved, not with a bang but
a whimper that talks about Alan Turing's not-told-enough story.

By external measures, things should probably be getting me down. But I know how
to exercise my uniquely human facilities and marshal my endless internal
energies and skills. Writings like this would be a good example. Lead by
example.

Don't be a sourpuss and don't assign blame. Don't rain down pessimism on
everyone around you looking for the next reason it's not your fault. Everything
in your life past a certain point is of your own choosing. The line demarcating
that point is blurred and dim, but that's no excuse either.

So what now? I'm waiting for some reports to generate for work to double-check
some numbers. When it's done running, I'm going to pull up the Web user
interface for the same report and create a screenshot to go side-by-side with
the Google Sheets-based dashboard. Okay, that's done.

Back to what you want and need to think about. Hmmm. Almost everything is done,
but not quite. I need to add support for categories to skite. If ELTgd (Every
Little Thing gets done) then I need to finish this out, or this little thing
isn't really done. Dependency-blocking... yeah, one thing is ***almost done***
but it depends on another thing and another thing and so on down the chain so
that not even one little thing can get done. Don't let that happen. 1, 2, 3...
1?

Look at the 10\_slice.ipynb code. Look at the most convenient place to inject
the support and HOW you're going to test it. Think! Okay, put in some category
data on MikeLev.in (this file).
