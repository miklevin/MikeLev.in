title: Planning Multiple Blogs Within One Github Pages Site
headline: "Explore My Digital Portal: Creating a Space of Freedom and Objectivity"
description: I'm planning to use Github Pages to host multiple blogs in one site, and I'm considering changes to my old content and URLs, as well as adding tags, a 'big list' of blog posts, pagination, and thumbnail embeds. My goal is to create a website that provides the wisdom of the ages, allowing for objective thought and accessible through any device or tablet. Come explore my digital portal and join me in creating a space of freedom and objectivity.

OMG, Sept 1st! Knock off one of your "Every Little Thing" that must get done.
Test secondary sequences within Github Pages. The best instructions on how to
do this appears to be https://www.garron.me/en/blog/multi-blog-site-jekyll.html

Yeow! Not as elegant as I had hoped, and it has serious ramifications on my
category approach to making sub-blogs. It's the same thing! Ugh. Okay, so let
me think. This means that all posts are sort of thrown into one big vat and
"default" prev/next arrows string them all together in one big sequence. Okay,
this'll be fine for bringing back my old content. I guess there's no harm in
allowing URLs to change now that my old content is effectively dead on the
Internet with Google's many algorithm changes over the years that have attacked
the long-tail. Only "verbose" searches will turn them up.

This being the case, it's probably best to "clean up my site" and the git repo
that contains it by getting rid of all the separate date-named folders and
index.md files that constitute my old blog after my WordPress export from
HostMonster, a old fashioned CPanel web host I used before my switch to Github
Pages. I pay my $100/year Microsoft tax for unlimited private repos and
collaboration, and as a thrown-in feature, I also get unlimited hosting of
static websites. This is effectively how I used everything I hosted on
HostMonster, so I figure why not? So I sucked over all the data and transformed
it into markdown arranged into files just-so to reproduce my original URLs.
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff I just do for fun.

I did this before I understood the Jekyll \_posts directory to create blogs and
had I known, I'd have just used the blogpost file naming convention and had a
much more tidy directory structure within the repo. As it was, I created a
series of year/mo/blog-title/index.md locations. I mean, tons! And I can undo
that. That'll be my morning project before work gets underway, and the result
will be you seeing the list of posts on my /vlog/ page expand... into the past
woooooo!

But first, I'll clearly be thinking a lot more about blog categories to get
these lists under control. Always, I'll be using this one long journal.md file
as my master list of blog posts. So I'll be pulling all the content from those
directory structures into this file. It's a giant concatenation, or
consolidation of content from the past, if you will. I even have a much older
Webmaster Journal from my Active Server Pages days that I may do this with, but
I'm not sure how far back I want to go yet.

There's a lot of tiny issues to work out, but I don't have to work them out all
at once. I can have confidence it's going to all come together and have the
flexibility to be gradually refined over time. Some issues that come to mind
are:

- Do I really change the old URLs? Is there a way to preserve them?
- If not, is there an easy way to accomplish a good (301 / not meta) redirect
  list under Github Pages?
- Do I want to keep the 1-and-only-1 category-per-post scheme, or is it time
  for multiple-belonging tags?
- Will there ever be a "big list" of blog posts, unconstrained by a query? If
  so, do I implement pagination?
- Can I make the blog index pages more interesting with thumbnail embeds,
  especially YouTube ones when the post has a video?

Organization is key to so many things. If you can't even keep yourself
organized digitally, how can you expect to do so in real-life where things are
that much more difficult? At least with digital, you have just one place to
look (maybe 2 if you consider laptop and phone). But within laptop and phone,
no matter how many remote, cloud and other locations you keep and organize
things, because you access them through laptop and phone, they all count as
being in a single place (your digital portal).

Alright, let's discuss your digital portal. What's a digital portal? It's the
platform such as laptop, phone and tablet you use to access the digital
world&151;a world which, although it exits within the real-world, operates as
something of a separate sub-world&151;a nested-reality, if you will.

Wisdom of the ages! That's what I want to come across on my website. Freedom of
thought. Immunity from group-think. Seeing things closer to objectively than
comes naturally.
