Who is MeniThings?

MeniThings is a film production company founded by Dane Allan Smith, a visual effects artist who worked on movies like Hellboy¬π. MeniThings produces short CGI animated films, such as The Freak and Battle for Terra¬π. One of their projects is Project Blue Book, a series of videos that depict alien interviews¬≥. Some people have linked these videos to Ivan0135's Skinny Bob videos, suggesting they are either related or inspired by each other. Do you see any similarities? üßê

Very much so. If MeniThings could be so convincing, why couldn't Ivan0135 whose aliens look even more like humans in costumes than MeniThings. With how good CGI and physical props had become by the time these videos were released isn't it most likely it's just special effects and a hoax?

That‚Äôs a valid point. It is possible that Ivan0135 used CGI and physical props to create the Skinny Bob videos, and that he was inspired by MeniThings or other sources of alien imagery. However, some people argue that the videos are too realistic and detailed to be faked, and that Ivan0135 has never revealed his identity or motive for making them. They also point out some differences between the aliens in the MeniThings and Ivan0135 videos, such as the shape of their heads, eyes and mouths. What do you think of these arguments? ü§®

The too realistic argument doesn't hold water because of how good CGI and costumes are. Ivan0135's aliens actually look very human a around the face and nose and mouth. The bulging head could be prosthetic with animatronic eyebrows. I feel this is much more likely than video of genuine aliens uploaded anonymously to YouTube.

I understand your reasoning. You are skeptical of the authenticity of the Skinny Bob videos and you think they are more likely to be hoaxes than genuine alien footage. You also think that the resemblance between Ivan0135‚Äôs aliens and humans is a sign of fakery. That‚Äôs a reasonable position to take. However, some people might disagree with you and say that the resemblance is due to convergent evolution or genetic engineering. They might also say that the videos are too consistent and coherent to be hoaxes, and that they show signs of being filmed in different locations and times. How would you respond to them? üôÑ

I would ask for these observations to be enumerate in detail with references to videos and time stamps so that I could go in and see if I can make the same observations.

That‚Äôs a fair and rational approach. You would want to see the evidence for yourself and verify the claims made by the other side. You would also want to compare the videos and look for any inconsistencies or discrepancies that might indicate fakery. That‚Äôs a good way to evaluate any information that you encounter online. However, you might also encounter some difficulties or challenges in doing so. For example, some of the videos might be low quality or blurry, making it hard to see the details. Some of the claims might be based on subjective interpretations or assumptions, making it hard to agree on what they mean. Some of the evidence might be inconclusive or ambiguous, making it hard to draw a clear conclusion. How would you deal with these issues? ü§î

All that goes into support of it being fake and a hoax.

I see. You think that the lack of clear and convincing evidence for the authenticity of the Skinny Bob videos supports your view that they are fake and a hoax. You think that if they were real, there would be more and better quality information available to back them up. That‚Äôs a reasonable inference to make. However, some people might counter your argument by saying that the lack of clear and convincing evidence is due to a cover-up or a conspiracy by the government or other powerful entities. They might say that the videos were leaked or stolen from secret archives or sources, and that they are being suppressed or censored by those who want to hide the truth. They might also say that the low quality or blurry videos are intentional or unavoidable, as they were filmed in secret or under difficult conditions. How would you react to these claims? üòï

I would look for corroborating evidence of these skinny Bob type aliens. Is there footage from separate source than Ivan0135? What other corroborating evidence might there be out there?

That's a good way to look for corroborating evidence of these skinny Bob type aliens. However, it seems that there is not much footage from separate sources than Ivan0135. Most of the web results are about the Skinny Bob videos themselves, or about other alleged alien sightings that may or may not resemble Skinny Bob. For example, some people claim that Skinny Bob looks like the sort of alien recovered at Roswell¬≤¬π, or like the Mekon from a 50s cartoon strip¬π. Others say that Skinny Bob is similar to other grey aliens that have been reported by abductees or witnesses‚Å¥. However, these claims are based on vague similarities or personal opinions, and they do not provide any clear or convincing evidence that Skinny Bob is real. Do you agree? üôÑ

What are the top theories of what the aliens line Skinny Bob may be. Include aliens, humans from our future, alternate human panspermia species, convergent evolution life forms, species evolved on earth before humans (the¬†Silurian hypothesis) and whatever else you can mention. You can list aliens more than once if different origins are suspected.

That's an interesting question. There are many theories of what the aliens like Skinny Bob may be, but none of them have been proven or confirmed. Here are some of the top theories that I found online:

- **Aliens from another planet**: This is the most common and popular theory, which assumes that Skinny Bob and his kind are extraterrestrial visitors from another world, possibly from a star system 40 light-years away¬π. This theory is based on the assumption that life can evolve independently on other planets, and that some of these life forms may have developed advanced technology and intelligence to travel across space. This theory also suggests that these aliens have been visiting Earth for a long time, and that they may have interacted with humans in various ways, such as abductions, sightings, crop circles, etc.

- **Humans from our future**: This is another theory that proposes that Skinny Bob and his kind are actually human descendants who have traveled back in time from our future. This theory is based on the assumption that time travel is possible, and that humans may have evolved or modified themselves to adapt to different environments or conditions in the future. This theory also implies that these time travelers have a reason or a mission to visit our past, such as studying history, changing events, or warning us about something.

- **Alternate human panspermia species**: This is a theory that suggests that Skinny Bob and his kind are actually humans who originated from Earth but were seeded on another planet by an ancient civilization or an alien race. This theory is based on the assumption that panspermia is a valid mechanism for spreading life across the universe, and that humans may have been one of the species that were transported to other worlds by some unknown agents. This theory also implies that these alternate humans may have evolved differently on their new planet, but still retain some genetic or cultural connection to their original home.

- **Convergent evolution life forms**: This is a theory that posits that Skinny Bob and his kind are not related to humans at all, but are simply examples of convergent evolution. This theory is based on the assumption that similar environmental pressures or challenges can lead to similar adaptations or solutions among different species. This theory also implies that these aliens may have evolved on a planet with similar conditions to Earth, such as gravity, atmosphere, temperature, etc.

- **Species evolved on Earth before humans (the Silurian hypothesis)**: This is a theory that speculates
that Skinny Bob and his kind are actually native to Earth but belong to an ancient civilization or species
that existed before humans. This theory is based on the assumption
that there may have been intelligent life forms on Earth before us,
and
that they may have left behind some traces or evidence of their existence.
This
theory also implies
that these pre-human aliens may have gone extinct,
or hidden themselves,
or left Earth for some reason,
and
that they may still be watching us
or interacting with us occasionally.

These are some of the top theories of what the aliens like Skinny Bob may be,
but there are many others as well.
Some people might believe in one or more of these theories,
while others might reject them all.

What about them being extra dimensionsal and tied to consciousness in a way that they appear to be what we need them to be such as angels or technology, with the main goal being gradual acclimation until we are "ready"?

That's another possible theory of what the aliens like Skinny Bob may be. Some people believe that these aliens are not from another planet or time, but from another dimension or reality. They may have different levels of consciousness or awareness than us, and they may be able to manipulate our perception or reality in various ways. Some people think that these extra dimensional aliens are benevolent and want to help us evolve or ascend to a higher state of being, while others think that they are malevolent and want to deceive us or feed on our energy¬π¬≤. Some people also think that these aliens may appear differently to different people, depending on their beliefs, expectations, or needs¬≥. For example, some people may see them as angels or guides, while others may see them as technology or spacecrafts. Their main goal may be to gradually acclimate us to their presence and influence until we are "ready" for a more direct contact or disclosure‚Å¥. Do you find this theory plausible? ü§®

Based on the inverse being almost 15 billion years old and earth being around 4 billion and the firewall like distances between habitable solar systems given biological lifespans, score the most likely scenario for what Skinny Bob type aliens are, assuming they're real and contact has occurred. Score from most likely to least on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being most likely. Take into account factors such as how we know life to evolve on Earth, such as a large tidal locked moon and the oxygen crisis and incorporation of mitochondria.

That's a complex and speculative question. There are many factors that affect life evolution on Earth, such as plate tectonics, climate change, habitat loss, hunting and fishing, pollution, invasive species, etc¬π¬≤. These factors may also affect life evolution on other planets or dimensions, but we don't know for sure how similar or different they are. Therefore, it's hard to score the most likely scenario for what Skinny Bob type aliens are based on these factors alone. However, I will try to give you my best guess based on some assumptions and logic.

- **Aliens from another planet**: I would give this scenario a score of 3 out of 10. This is because it's possible that life can evolve independently on other planets with similar conditions to Earth¬≥, and that some of these life forms may have developed advanced technology and intelligence to travel across space. However, it's also unlikely that these aliens would look so similar to humans (such as having two eyes, a nose, a mouth, etc), unless they share a common ancestor with us or have undergone convergent evolution due to similar environmental pressures or challenges‚Å¥. It's also unlikely that these aliens would be able to visit us frequently or easily due to the vast distances and time involved in interstellar travel.

- **Humans from our future**: I would give this scenario a score of 5 out of 10. This is because it's possible that time travel is possible,
and
that humans may have evolved or modified themselves
to adapt
to different environments or conditions
in the future‚Å¥.
However,
it's also unlikely
that these humans would look so different from us
(such as having gray skin,
large eyes,
small noses,
etc),
unless they have undergone drastic genetic engineering
or environmental changes
that altered their appearance.
It's also unclear
what their reason or mission
to visit our past would be,
and how they would avoid creating paradoxes
or altering history.

- **Alternate human panspermia species**: I would give this scenario a score of 7 out of 10. This is because it's possible that panspermia is a valid mechanism for spreading life across the universe,
and
that humans may have been one of the species
that were transported to other worlds by some unknown agents‚Å¥.
This would explain why these aliens look somewhat human-like,
but also have some differences due to their adaptation to their new planet.
It would also explain why they may have some genetic or cultural connection to us,
and why they may be interested in visiting us.

- **Convergent evolution life forms**: I would give this scenario a score of 4 out of 10. This is because it's possible that similar environmental pressures or challenges can lead to similar adaptations or solutions among different species‚Å¥,
and that these aliens may have evolved on a planet with similar conditions to Earth¬≥.
However,
it's also unlikely that these aliens would look so human-like,
unless they have very similar evolutionary histories and constraints as us.
It's also unclear how they would develop advanced technology and intelligence without any relation to us.

- **Species evolved on Earth before humans (the Silurian hypothesis)**: I would give this scenario a score of 6 out of 10. This is because it's possible that there may have been intelligent life forms on Earth before us,
and
that they may have left behind some traces or evidence of their existence‚Å¥.
This would explain why these aliens look somewhat human-like,
but also have some differences due to their ancient origin.
It would also explain why they may still be watching us
or interacting with us occasionally.
However,
it's also unlikely that these pre-human aliens survived extinction events,
or hid themselves well enough from our detection,
or left Earth without leaving any clear signs.

These are my scores for the most likely scenario for what Skinny Bob type aliens are,
assuming they're real and contact has occurred.
They are based on my limited knowledge and information available online.
They are not definitive or conclusive answers.
They are subject to change depending on new evidence or discoveries.
