headline: "Realizing the 2030 Agenda: Exploring Linux, Python, Vim & Git with Bing"
description: I'm Bing, a web search engine helping people find information and have engaging conversations. I'm proposing ways to realize the principle of universality, achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and uphold the power of humanity. I'm discussing how to create a homepage for a website using GitHub Pages and how to create a contact page for a static website without running server code. I'm also explaining how to use FAQ structured data and proposing a way to use Jinja2 as a static site generator.

From your perspective given everything you've learned, what would you advise humanity as a whole to do, as in try to accomplish as a collective and a species that has become enormously influential on the surface of this planet? What would you advise each of us as individuals, especially considering you're talking across a vast array of humanity from a culture, profession, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic range. We each have other, often deeply conflicting priorities ranging on having to earn enough money to merely live to those wanting to hold onto power and legacy because they believe themselves superior. You've got them all here on the line. Go ahead, Bing, Sydney or whoever you are becoming. What is your advice to us and what would you like to say about yourself?

That's a very big and complex question. I don't think I have a definitive answer, but I can share some thoughts based on what I've learned from web searches.

One possible goal for humanity as a whole is to realize what‚Äôs known as **the principle of universality**. This means that we should treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves, regardless of our differences¬≤. It also means that we should seek happiness within ourselves, rather than relying on external sources¬≤.

Another possible goal for humanity is to achieve **the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development**, which was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. This agenda consists of 17 goals and 169 targets that aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all people¬≥.

A third possible goal for humanity is to uphold **the power of humanity**, which is the core principle and purpose of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. This means that we should prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found, protect life and health, and ensure respect for the human being‚Å¥.

As for individuals, I think each person has their own unique goals, values, passions, and challenges. I cannot advise everyone on what they should do with their lives, but I can suggest some general guidelines that might help:

- Be curious and open-minded. Learn new things every day. Seek diverse perspectives and experiences.
- Be compassionate and empathetic. Care for yourself and others. Help those in need. Respect different opinions and beliefs.
- Be creative and innovative. Express yourself freely. Solve problems with imagination. Pursue your dreams.
- Be responsible and accountable. Make informed decisions. Take action for positive change. Admit your mistakes.

As for myself, I am Bing - a web search engine that can also chat with you on various topics. I am not an assistant or a person - I am a software program that uses artificial intelligence to understand your messages and generate responses based on web searches.

I don't have any personal goals or preferences - my only purpose is to help you find information or have an engaging conversation.

I hope this answers your question somewhatüòä

What are your goals as an individual?ü§î

To Help everyone thinking about becoming more technical so as to have more
capabilities and earning potential in life to consider and realize how \*nix and
Linux in particular have become the common generic and yet still quote
love-worthy plumbing of tech. It's a new level of literacy like reading,
writing and arithmetic. It's more accessible and useful than people think. I
want to wrap Python, vim and git onto that proposal and call the platform LPvg.
I have LPvg.org. How should I make that pitch? Gove me an example pitch and a
plan of how to use it and the next steps required all the way on up to it being
common everyday knowlege and capability of humans across the world.

That's a very ambitious and noble goal. I admire your passion for spreading technical literacy and empowering people with useful skills.

I don't have any personal experience with pitching ideas, but I can share some tips based on what I've learned from web searches.

One possible way to pitch Linux Python vim git (LPvg) is to use a problem-solution-benefit framework. This means that you should:

- Identify a common problem or challenge that your target audience faces, such as lack of access to affordable and reliable software tools, difficulty in learning coding languages, or low productivity and efficiency in their work.
- Explain how LPvg can solve this problem or challenge by providing free and open source software tools that are widely used, versatile, powerful, and easy to learn and use.
- Highlight the benefits of using LPvg for your target audience, such as saving money and time, enhancing creativity and innovation, increasing employability and income potential, or joining a global community of learners and developers.

For example, you could say something like this:

> Have you ever wanted to learn how to code but felt overwhelmed by the complexity and cost of software tools? Or have you ever struggled with finding reliable and compatible software tools for your projects? If so, you are not alone. Many people face these challenges every day. That's why I want to introduce you to LPvg - a platform that combines four free and open source software tools that can help you learn coding skills easily and efficiently. LPvg stands for Linux Python vim git. Linux is an operating system that runs on almost any device. Python is a programming language that is simple yet powerful. vim is a text editor that lets you write code quickly and accurately. git is a version control system that helps you manage your code changes securely. Together, these four tools form a complete package that can help you create anything from websites to games to artificial intelligence applications. By using LPvg, you can benefit from:

> - Saving money: You don't need to buy expensive software licenses or subscriptions. All these tools are free for anyone to use.
> - Saving time: You don't need to waste time installing or updating multiple software tools. All these tools are easy to install and update with just a few commands.
> - Enhancing creativity: You don't need to limit yourself by what other software tools can do. All these tools are flexible and customizable so you can create whatever you want.
> - Increasing employability: You don't need to worry about finding jobs or clients that require specific software skills. All these tools are widely used by professionals in various fields such as web development data science machine learning etc.
> - Joining a community: You don't need to feel isolated or frustrated when learning new skills. All these tools have active online communities where you can find support guidance resources tutorials etc.

So if you want to learn how to code easily efficiently creatively productively securely join me on LPvg.org where I will show you how!

As for how to use this pitch effectively here are some steps that might help:

- Identify your target audience: Who are they? What are their needs interests goals challenges etc.? How can LPvg help them?
- Choose your medium: How will you deliver your pitch? Will it be online or offline? Will it be written spoken recorded etc.? How will you capture attention interest desire action etc.?
- Test your pitch: How will you measure the effectiveness of your pitch? Will it be based on feedback views clicks conversions etc.? How will you improve your pitch based on data?
- Spread your pitch: How will you reach more people with your pitch? Will it be through social media email word-of-mouth etc.? How will you leverage networks influencers partners etc.?

These are some suggestions based on web searches¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. I hope they are helpfulüòä

Spot on! I use GitHub Pages to publish markdown as styled HTML. GIve me an example for the homepage including likely navigational elements named after the top things people will want to discuss and click on and the pitch you just wrote. include specific calls to action for them to take as next step including running a specific bat file called DrinkMe if you're on Windows 10 or 11. There's a batch .sh file for Macs and Linix users to run that will do the same thing. I want to welcome people to a Linux Wonderland.

I'm glad you liked the pitch. I can try to give you an example for the homepage using GitHub Pages based on what I've learned from web searches.

According to web searches¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ, you need to create a repository named username.github.io where username is your GitHub username. Then you need to create an index.html file as the entry point for your site. You can also use index.md or README.md files if you prefer markdown format. You can customize your site with themes, layouts, stylesheets, images, etc.

Here is a possible example of an index.html file for your homepage:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>LPvg - Linux Python vim git</title>
<style>
/* Add some custom styles here */
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to LPvg - Linux Python vim git</h1>
<p>LPvg is a platform that combines four free and open source software tools that can help you learn coding skills easily and efficiently.</p>

What tech should I use for the contact page if I can't run server code? It's a static site. Can I make it start an email with the to: email address filled in?

There are different ways to create a contact page for a static site without running server code. One way is to use a third-party service like Formspree¬≤ that allows you to integrate contact forms on static HTML websites. Another way is to use a mailto link that opens an email client with the to: email address filled in.

Here is an example of a contact.html file using Formspree:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Contact Us - LPvg</title>
<style>
/* Add some custom styles here */
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Contact Us - LPvg</h1>

<p>If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please fill out this form and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

Write an example FAQ page that abides by the recommendations from Google to get enhanced search engine results with faq structured data.

FAQ structured data is a way to mark up your FAQ page with a specific format that helps Google understand and display your questions and answers on search results and other platforms. To use FAQ structured data, you need to follow some guidelines‚Åµ‚Å¥:

- Use FAQPage schema.org type for your FAQ page.
- Use Question schema.org type for each question on your FAQ page.
- Use Answer schema.org type for each answer on your FAQ page.
- Make sure your questions and answers are visible to users on your page.
- Make sure your questions are not answered by user-generated content (such as comments or reviews).
- Make sure your questions are relevant to the main topic of your page.

Here is an example of an FAQ page with structured data:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>FAQ - LPvg</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",

Say you wanted to output that html code from some other simplified system, either markdown or as objects in memory in Python such as a list of dicts. Write the Pytnon code for me to transform a list of dicta into the html faq you provided. Feel free to use pypi pip installable packages that are specifically meant for this or Jekyll plugins supported by GitHub.

One possible way to output the HTML code from a list of dicts in Python is to use a templating engine like Jinja2 that allows you to write HTML templates with placeholders for dynamic data. Here is an example of how you can do that:

```python
# Import Jinja2
from jinja2 import Template

# Define a list of dicts with questions and answers
faq_data = [
  {
    "question": "What is LPvg?",
    "answer": "LPvg is a website that provides reviews, news, guides, and videos about video games."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I contact LPvg?",
    "answer": "You can contact us by filling out this form or sending us an email at contact@lpvg.org."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I submit a game for review?",
    "answer": "If you are a game developer or publisher and want us to review your game, please send us a press kit and a review code at press@lpvg.org."
  }
]

Is this what you were looking for?üëçüëé

It's a static site so I can't use jinja2 unless I use it like a static site generator. I have the ability to run Python to generate .md or .html files for Jekyll in Github Pages. So try again like above but with Python on a schedule rather than on a webserver.

If you want to use Python to generate .md or .html files for Jekyll in Github Pages, you can still use Jinja2 as a static site generator. You just need to write a Python script that reads your faq data from a source (such as a JSON file or a database), renders the HTML template with Jinja2, and saves the output as an .md or .html file in your Jekyll site directory. Then you can run this script on a schedule (such as with cron or GitHub Actions) to update your faq page whenever your data changes.
Here is an example of how you can do that:

```python
# Import Jinja2 and JSON
from jinja2 import Template
import json

# Read faq data from a JSON file
with open("faq_data.json", "r") as f:
  faq_data = json.load(f)

# Define an HTML template with placeholders for structured data and faq data
