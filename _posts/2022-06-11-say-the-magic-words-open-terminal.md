title: "Say The Magic Words: Open Terminal!"
headline: Unlock the Magic of Unix/Linux with the French Drop and Miss. Direction!
description: I learned the French Drop finger magic trick from my camp counselor Mike Silver at Science Camp Watonka when I was 12 years old. Now, I'm introducing a new skill called the French Drop and Miss. Direction, closely aligned with Unix/Linux. This skill is future-proof, obsolescence resistant, and immune to disruption. It's important to not solely depend on GUIs and to focus on Unix/Linux terminal.

Show the nice people how the sausage is made. Don't bore the magic seekers, but
do give deep insight to the spiritual seekers. Break this en in two. Yeah,
break it in two then go see your kid.

All I have to do is blow up on YouTube and all my woes are over, you say? The
first 1000 followers are the easiest, you say? [Tab 2]

It's time to address the elephant in the room. Few of you here are really here
to learn about Linux from me and how it's going to change your life. Most of my
happenstance audience just wants to see more hand magic.  [Tab 3]

More finger magic. We'll here's some finger magic for you… no really, it's
called the French Drop and I learned it from my camp counselor Mike Silver, the
openly first gay person I knew, at science Camp Watonka at Lake Wallenpaupack
40 years ago when I was 12 years old—right around the corner here from where I
life today… at least for the next 2 weeks.  [Tab 4]

This was the summer before my trip to Israel with my friend Guy Bruchstein and
his family. Yeah, that's a lot to unpack, right? So more videos to come on my
most singular life experiences sandwiched between the rise of Unix and the
death of Commodore. I've got so much to teach this generation of unreachable
TikTokers and Boomer-knockers. Maybe you're a Boomer…

I am not a Boomer (in Arnie voice… anyone? Anyone? Bueller?)

Well let's focus now on Camp Wataonka and the most important magic which I did
learn there and which I didn't learn there. I took the hand magic and I left
the computer science. It was booooooring and not for me. I mean adding and
shifting in binary? Really? I had to know that? What kind of brain fart people
were into computers anyway. Me? Give me art, magic, comic books and Dungeons &
Dragons any day. [Tab 5]

Why did nobody reach me about abstractions and switches gradually fading away
into a sort of magic as layered up APIs simplify human/interfaces until all
that remains is a sort of spontaneous creative expression like the Mickey's
Sorcerer's Apprentice, but gone right? [Tab 6]

Sigh, couldda wouldda shouldda, am I right? We'll, if I knew then what I know
know, what would I have done? I would have told someone like you looking for
mere hand trick magic to listen to someone like me who offers a more beautiful
life-changing sort of magic which is every bit as spiritually satisfying and
audience-impressing. Ever watch finger-magic computer hackers in the movies,
working their magic with nearly telepathic control of computers, near and far?
War Games from my generation comes to mind, but there's also Mr. Robot from
more recent. Yeah, I offer you that.  [Tab 7]

Twelve and Thirteen years old were very formative years in my life, and if the
removable finger trick is the bookmark to my 6-year old self and my
relationship with my “special” mailman Mr. Sucro, the French Drop is the
bookmark to my adolescence and my “special relationship” with my overnight camp
counselor and U.K. magician Mike Silver. Both of these men imprinted on me
deeply. Deeply in all the good and right ways. This is not going where you
think and the fact that that is the automatic response in todays society is a
problem. May I suggest you all read The Road to Oz where Dorothy meets the
Shaggy Man, ye-old Scooby Doo's buddy and a fine overlooked example for our
culture to emulate.  [Tab 9]

We'll happily the Web puts a giant firewall between Shaggy Men and your kids
but still let that special mailman or camp counselor into your life without
todays stranger danger paranoia. And so a buddy like me can show you the French
Drop in the spirit of the great Penn & Teller, bad boys of magic who revealed
the disappearing handkerchief trick to the world before it was cool to admit
Magic was all tricks. It's all tricks, people! Stranger danger is a trick to
control you. The weird isn't really that dangerous and some of the most
valuable information needing to be transmitted between generations is going to
come from peeps like my mailman Mr. Sucro, my camp counselor Mike Silver, or
indeed me right here right now with the French Drop.  [Tab 10]

I'm one-take Mike. I rarely edit, but when I do I get a million views. So come
with me now as we go behind the scenes now and wax-on and wax-off. Wax-on and
wax-off. Listen to Mr. Miyagi. He knows he can't convince you to internalize
the movements through practice without tricks. Without force. You have to want
something so badly, like freedom from bullies, that you're willing to put in
the work on faith. You won't know you're learning exactly the skills, the very
muscle memory, the precise movements you will need to defend yourself and
ultimately kick butt in life.  [Tab 11]

How do you know you're onto something important or new? A thread you must
follow? How do you know you found something loveworthy? How do you know you're
walking into the circles of your Ikigai?  It feels like Christmas Eve. You know
gifts are coming. You know a light is about to come into your life.

Let me show you something. It's called The French Drop.

Let me introduce you to someone. Her name is Miss. Direction.

Next step: More finger magic, hand magic

Lure 'em in with tricks... move onto what's important...

Life-skills... most valuable... most relevant... and just feeling good about
your abilities in the most number of situations.

All tech is text.

The single most important skill (a.k.a. trick) in life is developing your
wax-on, wax-off ability in the vim text editor.

- Magic... desires for it...
- Closely aligned with Unix/Linux
  - Muscle memory
  - Cool tricks
  - Lasting a lifetime

- Future-proof
- Obsolescence Resistant
- Immune to Disruption

Text wars...
- NOT VSCode vs. PyCharm
- eMacs vs. vi(m)
- emacs = RMS/LISP/MIT
  - THE Most Powerful Wizards
  - e"VI"l mode (vi emulation)
  - Harder
- vi(m) = Bill Joy/Bell/Unix/C
  - vim = vi(iMitated)... on the Amiga
  - vim = vi(iMproved)... rest of world
  - vim = Bram Moolenaar
  - The copied text-control magic
    - VSCode uses it
    - Other "vi-clones" use it
  - Plays like a video-game
    - Like martial arts

- Linux (Microsoft made WSL)
- Python (Hired Guido van Rossum)
- vim ??? M$ created VSCode
- git (Microsoft bought Github.com)
  - Bought NPM (NodeJS's repo) too

VSCode... while crazy-great
...also blocking you from vim!!!

- GUIs (Visual Desktops)
  - Necessary, no doubt
  - But don't depend on them
  - Depend ONLY on \*nix Terminal

- Unix
  - Unix Bell Labs / Ken Thompson
  - Proprietary at birth
  - Ivory Tower
  - DNS (address resolution)
- Linux
  - Linus Torvalds
  - GNU GPL2 (forces sharing)
  - A lot of interplay
  - The Web LAMP
