AI makes it feel like we're facing unprecedented change, but we've lived through
the industrial, atomic, and information ages. Humanity adapts. It's not the
first time we've had to change the way we live and work. Join me as I, a
50-something, musters enough neuroplasticity to adapt and thrive while avoiding
the hamster wheel of tech, and mastering a small set of versatile, timeless
tools. On this site, I focus on:

- **Linux, Python, vim & git**: Mastering the future-proof LPvg minimum subplatform
- **Re-acquiring Math Skills**: Picking up where my 1970s K-12 education let me down
- **Staying at the Top of My Field**: Protecting my earning capacity as things change
- **The minimal tool-chain for AI**: Expanding LPvg to include vector databases, etc.

## It's Text-files All The Way Down

It's all about text files and pushing bits around. Even after the rise of AI,
this fundamental concept will persist. User interfaces may change, and barriers
for entry will lower for non-programmers, but interacting with AIs won't absolve
you from learning to code. It just makes initial sketching easier. However,
complex problems remain complex.

While Jensen Huang says you won't have to learn to code and calls Python weird,
he admits that the first time you talk to AI will be in English, but the second
time it can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NSBdLouwEDM">give you the
Python code</a>. See the contradiction? You won't need to learn coding unless
you want to do second-pass refinements. English isn't reliable enough to build
automated systems around, and Python has become the lingua franca of tech.

## The Hamster Wheel of Faddish Tech

Tech fads reset every 5 to 10 years. If you're on that hamster wheel, such as
with modern JavaScript frameworks, you go from Angular to React to Vue to
Svelte, constantly relearning, retraining, and either migrating or abandoning
old code bases. Generally, the concept of a "framework" is to blame. But Python
hit a fundamental level and IS the framework. Even when you use a framework on
top of Python, such as Flask, FastAPI, or FastHTML, switching is much easier.
Python interfaces remain remarkably stable over the years, allowing your
intuition and muscle memory to improve.

The new breed of AI text-editors emphasizes this point. Your text editor is
where you spend a significant amount of time. It's even more essential than your
bed or chair because it becomes ingrained in your fingers through muscle memory
and shortcuts. Switching text editors can be more disruptive than switching
programming languages. Think VSCode is here forever? It's already under attack
from Cursor. As with PFE, Notepad++, TextMate, Sublime Text, Atom, and Brackets,
it will come and go. Vim (vi, nvim, etc.), the one all the others try to
emulate, will be the only safe harbor for your fingers. 

## Future-Proofing with LPvg Skills

If you develop muscle memory from years of practice in this slightly
less-than-sexiest of tech (at least as a secondary tech-stack you know), then
you won't become obsolete. LPvg skills may not be as trendy or seemingly
valuable as the current fad, but they will keep your skills relevant and provide
an alternative to popular approaches, offering some freedom from vendor lock-in.

No matter how jazzed up or convenient power-tools become, you'll notice an
underlying system of Linux, Python, vim, and git that even they rely on. Windows
and Mac strive to be Linux for the developer. All text editors offer a vim
emulation mode. When's the last time Python hasn't been the default answer AIs
want to give you (except for Claude artifacts). And git is... well, git. I'm
sort of advocating the pee in the pool of tech. These are the 80/20-rule "good
enough" tools that have become free, time-tested and are just accessible enough
for the average person.

## Lessons from the Amiga: Loving the Abstractions

It's not always smooth sailing. The carpet can be pulled out from under you, no
matter how well you prepare. The idea is to make smart choices, so a good deal
of what you know and your hard-won muscle memory and habits remain applicable.

I fell in love with the Amiga Computer some 30 years ago and have been trying to
recapture that magic ever since. I've concluded that you shouldn't fall in love
with your hardware or the particulars of your system. Instead, if you can love
some of the higher-level abstractions that cut across time, space, and problem
domains, you'll be okay.
