title: Challenging OpenAI to Write a Better Subhead Than this Headline
headline: Exploring Home and Spiritual Connection - My Journey of Self-Discovery
description: I recently signed up for Copilot, an AI that can summarize and assign keywords to my writing. I'm exploring the idea of home and how it is not confined to the place you were born into. I'm discovering my roots are inside me and that I can find places I feel most at home. I'm also investigating spiritual connection and its impact on our lives. Read my blog post to explore these ideas with me.

Think! Idea capture sure has become a lot more exciting. The idea that even my
all-over-the-place ramblings will be examined, summarized, turned into a meta
description and have keywords assigned to it by an AI makes it exciting. If
it's learning from my writing, it's going to be a lot more interesting. But
when I signed up for Copilot, I told it that it couldn't use what it learned
from me in code suggestions for other people.

Isn't that the exact opposite of what I'm trying to accomplish. And now that I
learned how to turn Copilot off in my private journal, I may consider letting
it use what it learns from me. Hmmm. What would I like to teach an AI? Home. Of
all the labels, home is one of the most appealing and tricky. The home you were
born into doesn't necessarily define you, though there are lots of forces out
there that would have you think otherwise. Royalty, for example.

Sure it's sour grapes, but roots and home are overrated. I don't realize this
was in my blood until my first wife explained to me what the tribe of Levite
was about. No land. Just techs skills. Hahaha, that's so me. Earth is my home.

The neighborhood and bedroom you were born into is not your roots. Even
generational wealth you may have been morn into is not your heritage. Maybe in
the time of matter mattering so much because everyone wanted to emulate the
British who coveted Kingdoms. It's not a kingdom contest. Or at least, there's
more games of significance being played these days than mere re-distribution of
atom.

Your roots are inside of you. Lost as you may be, if you k is how to find
yourself on the inside, you are always hole. It's okay to drop anchor here and
there in life. You'll find places you do indeed feel most "home". But what
you're feeling is connection to a certain feeling that particular time and
place evoke on you. It's the effect of stimulant-triggered neurotransmitter
chemical signals that you're feeling and enjoying.

Now I'm not saying it's not spiritual or deeply important and moving. It
probably is. Even if we have souls or something and we're channeling from
another place while stuck here on this material plane for awhile, so be it.
Belief in such a scenario still does not appear to suggest more or less value
in living this way or that.

The self-aware experience here on this material plane feels very likely to be a
means to question-answering ends on these accounts.  Once again,

Don't give it a headline till the end. Okay, it's like surprise gift time
whenever I publish a blog post. Choose a headline now, and challenge OpenAI to
choose a better subhead.
