title: Install ZFSUtils-Linux To Prep For LXD on WSL
headline: "Exploring LXD: Installing ZFSUtils-Linux on WSL to Move Life Forward"
description: I'm on a mission to move my life forward, so I'm looking around the world to find the answers. Today, I'm focusing on LXD, a Linux container service, and I'm learning how to install ZFS Filesystem for Linux and the advantages of containers over virtual machines. Come along with me on my journey and read my blog post to see what I'm learning.

                              What's most broken?
                    Where's the biggest bang for the buck?
                          What plates need spinning?</pre>


These are things I ask myself every day.

Or at least I try to.

They align with other important principles that must be simultaneously applied:

- Look around you. The world is your checklist. Find something?
- How deep does the rabbit hole go? Do a rabbit hole evaluation.
- What irrevocably moves your life forward? Compounding returns?

# The World is Your Checklist. Look Around.

When someone tells you vim has no practical application, ask them when they
"think out loud to themselves"...

- Where do they do it?
- Using what tools?
- How well it works?

My answer is that I do it in one single text-file. This... but not always this.
When it becomes something I can share publicly and has value (because the best
way to learn is to teach), then "bump" it to the right.

Like this...

Show the nice folks. Then share that video you're learning from and what you're
going to do about it.

LXD is on my mind.

LXC are Linux containers (daemons, a.k.a. Linux services)

Previously it was LXC (c for containers).

The first step is to install ZFS Filesytem for Linux, which is the old Sun
Solaris filesystem, now for FOSSy Linux.

We will stop there for today, 'cause I got stuff to do.

Run Linux containers (LXD / NOT Docker) on Windows Subsystem for Linux

Why?

So you get first-hand experience setting up Linux System Services without
compromising, corrupting, or otherwise FUBAR'ing your main linux system.

That's the advantage of containers.

Why not "virtual machines"?

Because they are terrible. Horrible. They're not going to be there for you on a
24 x 7 basis for many reasons I will cover in future videos.

But a container will.

And if not the container itself, your learnings flow right over to:

- Local Linux server (Raspberry Pi, QNAP NAS)
- Local laptop (still on WSL)
- Cloud server
