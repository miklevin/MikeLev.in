permalink: /futureproof/from-blog-to-book-ai-powered-ia/
description: This article documents my journey to restructure my blog's information architecture and generate a book outline using AI analysis. While I initially explored local tools like Ollama and RAG via Open WebUI, I quickly pivoted to harnessing the massive multi-million token context windows offered by frontier models like Google's Gemini. I detail the iterative development of Python scripts (`context_foo.py`), heavily assisted by Claude, to precisely chunk and prepare my entire blog content for these large models. I then share my experiments feeding these large context files to Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.5 Experimental, culminating in successfully generating a detailed, linked site topology map and book outline, showcasing a practical approach of using frontier AI's capabilities for large-scale content analysis.

## From Local RAG to Frontier Models: A Strategic Pivot

My initial plan for tackling the disorganized sprawl of my blog archive involved
leveraging local tools like Ollama and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The
idea of a self-hosted solution analyzing my content held strong appeal. However,
the practicalities of implementing effective RAG – managing text splitting,
chunking, and overlap started to look complex. 

### Embracing Million-Token Context Windows

Around the same time, frontier models like Gemini began boasting massive,
multi-million token context windows. This sparked a strategic shift: what if,
instead of intricate local RAG, I could simply prepare my *entire* blog's
content using a tool like `context_foo.py` and feed it directly into one of
these powerful frontier models in a single shot (or a few large chunks)? This
article chronicles that transition, detailing the development of the necessary
tooling and the subsequent experiments using large context models for site
analysis and restructuring.

---

## Exploring Local RAG with Open WebUI

I am starting to investigate [Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) for local
Ollama tasks, such as looking across all my published articles with local RAG to
help me summarize and organize it into more of a planned book with a good user
experience than the hodgepodge organic daily journal compilation that it is
today.

### SEO and Site Navigation Considerations

There is also an SEO aspect here, with topic analysis and keyword groups. It has
ramifications for site navigation and hub-and-spoke structures that will help
LLM-directed real-time site-crawls drill down more logically to find the data
they want from an initial visit to the homepage. The idea being that this
reverse chronological linear progression of articles, while without changing URL
structure, will no longer be featured as one giant list on the homepage. But
neither will I succumb to the deep click-depth pitfall of paginated navigation!
When old content goes in the archive, it will still all be finable at a maximum
of 5-clicks off the homepage. 

### The 5-Click Depth Information Architecture

Say the homepage had 10 links and each subsequent page-level had an additional
10 links. Assuming each link on a page leads to a unique page at the next level,
at 5-clicks off the homepage, you'd have:

1.  **Homepage (Level 0 / 0 Clicks):** 1 page. It has 10 links.
2.  **Level 1 (1 Click):** Those 10 links from the homepage lead to 10 unique pages. (10¹ = 10 pages)
3.  **Level 2 (2 Clicks):** Each of the 10 pages at Level 1 has 10 links. So, there are 10 * 10 = 100 pages at this level. (10² = 100 pages)
4.  **Level 3 (3 Clicks):** Each of the 100 pages at Level 2 has 10 links. So, there are 100 * 10 = 1,000 pages at this level. (10³ = 1,000 pages)
5.  **Level 4 (4 Clicks):** Each of the 1,000 pages at Level 3 has 10 links. So, there are 1,000 * 10 = 10,000 pages at this level. (10⁴ = 10,000 pages)
6.  **Level 5 (5 Clicks):** Each of the 10,000 pages at Level 4 has 10 links. So, there are 10,000 * 10 = 100,000 pages at this level. (10⁵ = 100,000 pages)

At 5 clicks off the homepage, you would potentially reach **100,000** unique
pages, assuming this strict branching structure with no duplicate links or pages
appearing at multiple levels. Certainly a blog that's only up to about 200 pages
could be structured to fit in what amounts to a 5-click-depth information
architecture (IA) or site topology phase space. This is your navigational
envelope or reachability horizon. Planning your site out to work this way so it
plays well in LLM-driven small-world crawl drill-downs is a big part of the AI
SEO revolution going on right now. 

### Internal Search and LLM Crawlers

There's also the matter of your site's internal search tool and usability by
that same-said LLM-crawler to short-circuit the link-finding and drill-down
process, but I will have to earmark that an think about it separately later, as
the site redistribution and rebalancing is enough to think through here.

## Database Considerations for Content Rebalancing

The first step in such a rebalancing is certainly to get your data into either
or both a vector encoding database and a graph database. Is that a first step?
It sounds like a whole lotta steps. And so that brings us back to a big part of
why I installed *Open WebUI*

## Reimagining Content Organization for AI Consumption

Let's say I was creating gold here, but it was of no use to anybody because my
writing style is dense, not well organized, and without visuals. But in the age
of AI, that sort of thing should not be a problem. Say I wanted to keep this
original "raw material" as sort of an archive, with select bits that have been
proven to work well at safe harbor shallow click-depths. But all the rest is
going to be driven down into that 100K phase-space information architecture,
while carefully crafted "hub pages" of that evenly distributed hub-and-spoke
drill-down topology. Let's say that.

I would start out with a site much like this, with incredibly densely packed
content, making good points and having interesting and valuable information that
only an LLM could navigate and absorb -- but not all at once. But you know what?
Let's not rule even that out. If an AI could look at the entire site at once, it
would eliminate all that RAG text-splitting, chunk size and overlap stuff. 

**Me**: You still remember `context_foo.py`?

**Claude**: Yes, I remember `context_foo.py`. It's a script that generates context files for AI interactions, with three templates:

1. **General Codebase Analysis**: For understanding Pipulate's architecture
2. **MCP Integration Challenge**: For planning Model Context Protocol integration
3. **Next Action Analysis**: For helping Chip O'Theseus identify and prioritize tasks

The third template is particularly relevant to our current discussion about memory systems, as it includes sections specifically about:

- Local memory and persistence systems
- Memory considerations (short-term, medium-term, long-term, semantic)
- Memory architecture planning

Looking at what we just implemented with `memory.py` and the memory system integration into `server.py`, we've actually started implementing some of the key components outlined in that template:

1. **Short-term memory**: Chat history and recent actions via `memory.get_recent()`
2. **Key/value store**: Basic persistent storage via `memory.store_kv()` and `memory.get_kv()`
3. **Searchable content**: Using SQLite FTS5 for full-text search via `memory.search()`

Would you like me to:
1. Update the Next Action Analysis template to reflect what we've built?
2. Use the template to analyze our next steps?
3. Something else with `context_foo.py`?

**Me**: Oh yeah, well check out `@cat_foo.py`!

**Claude**: Ah, I see what you're getting at! `cat_foo.py` is a simple but effective script that concatenates all your markdown files into a single `foo.md` file, adding headers for each source file. This is interesting in relation to `context_foo.py` because:

1. Both scripts generate "foo" files (`foo.md` vs `foo.txt`)
2. Both are about aggregating context, just in different ways:
   - `cat_foo.py`: Combines markdown files sequentially
   - `context_foo.py`: Creates structured context with templates and file contents

We could potentially enhance both scripts to work together with our new memory system. For example:

1. When `cat_foo.py` combines files, it could also:
   - Store each article in the memory system with metadata
   - Create searchable sections based on headers
   - Track relationships between articles

2. When `context_foo.py` generates context, it could:
   - Search the memory system for relevant content
   - Include related articles or sections in the context
   - Track which contexts were most useful

Would you like me to:
1. Enhance either script to work with the memory system?
2. Create a new template in `context_foo.py` specifically for article analysis?
3. Something else with these scripts?

The synergy between these tools could help Chip become more knowledgeable about your writing and thought process over time.

**Me**: This one isn't for Chip O'Theseus. Inevitably, we're going to have to
use a text-splitting, chunking and overlapping approach given it's underpowered
local status. What I'm getting at is giving Gemini a run for its money, given
its original and continuing reputation for massive token context windows. I
think I might like to drop some of the biggest foo-files of all time on it,
sized-to-fit of course thanks to our new tiktoken manifest approach. I could
chunk the foo files right up to the maximum context window of even Gemini, which
is reported to be...

**Me**: What's the biggest Gemini token context window these days?

**Gemini Deep Research**: 

# **Analysis of the Largest Gemini Token Context Window**

## **1. Introduction**

The Gemini family of large language models, developed by Google DeepMind, represents a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence. These models are designed to be multimodal, capable of processing and generating various types of information, including text, audio, images, and video.1 A crucial factor determining the capabilities of such large language models is the size of their token context window. This window defines the amount of information a model can process within a single interaction, directly impacting its ability to handle complex tasks that require understanding extensive data.3 A larger context window allows the model to maintain coherence and relevance over longer inputs, leading to improved performance in tasks such as summarizing long documents, analyzing lengthy audio or video files, and understanding vast codebases.3 This report aims to identify the Gemini model with the largest token context window currently available, detail its size and announcement history, and discuss any associated limitations or specific conditions.

## **2. Overview of Gemini Models and Their Context Window Sizes**

The Gemini family comprises several models, each with specific strengths and optimizations. These include models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, among others like embedding and experimental versions.6 These models are designed for a variety of use cases, ranging from enhanced reasoning and multimodal understanding to cost-efficient and low-latency applications.6 The design choices for each model often involve trade-offs between factors like model size, processing speed, intelligence level, and the capacity of their context window.6

The input and output token limits for various Gemini models, as of April 4, 2025, are summarized in the table below 6:

| Model | Input Token Limit | Output Token Limit/Dimension Size |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview | 1,048,576 | 65,536 |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | 1,048,576 | 8,192 |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite | 1,048,576 | 8,192 |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash | 1,048,576 | 8,192 |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B | 1,048,576 | 8,192 |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro | 2,097,152 | 8,192 |
| Gemini Embedding | 8,192 | 3072/1536/768 (Dimension Size) |
| Text Embedding | 2,048 | 768 (Dimension Size) |
| Embedding | 2,048 | 768 (Dimension Size) |
| AQA | 7,168 | 1,024 |

As evident from the data, there is a considerable range in the context window sizes across the Gemini model family. This variation likely reflects the specific optimization goals for each model, balancing the need for extensive context with efficiency and cost-effectiveness.6

## **3. The Gemini Model with the Largest Context Window**

Based on the available information, **Gemini 1.5 Pro** stands out as the model with the largest input token context window, boasting an impressive limit of **2,097,152 tokens**.3 This substantial capacity allows the model to process vast amounts of information in a single prompt, such as approximately 2 hours of video, 19 hours of audio, codebases containing around 60,000 lines of code, or the equivalent of 2,000 pages of text.3 While its output token limit is 8,192 tokens, the sheer size of its input context window positions Gemini 1.5 Pro as a leader in handling tasks requiring extensive contextual understanding.6

It is also worth noting that Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, while having a lower input token limit of 1,048,576, offers a significantly larger output token limit of 65,536.6 This suggests that while Gemini 1.5 Pro is designed to ingest and process massive amounts of information, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview may be better suited for applications requiring the generation of very long responses.6 Therefore, the definition of "biggest" context window can depend on whether the focus is on input processing or output generation. However, in terms of input capacity, Gemini 1.5 Pro currently holds the largest window size within the Gemini family.

## **4. Announcement and Update History of the Largest Context Window**

The journey towards the 2 million token context window of Gemini 1.5 Pro involved several key announcements and updates. In **February 2024**, Google first announced Gemini 1.5 as its next-generation model, highlighting a breakthrough in long-context understanding.1 At this stage, Gemini 1.5 Pro was introduced with a standard 128,000 token context window, while Google also mentioned successfully testing up to 1 million tokens in their research.5 This initial announcement indicated the experimental nature and potential of this expanded context capability.5 Simultaneously, a limited preview of the experimental 1 million token context window for Gemini 1.5 Pro was made available to select developers and enterprise customers.5

Later, at **Google I/O in May 2024**, a significant expansion was announced: the context window for Gemini 1.5 Pro was increased to 2 million tokens and made accessible to developers through a private preview.1 This development marked a substantial increase in the model's ability to process information, allowing it to handle even longer videos, audio files, and larger codebases.13 By **June 2024**, the 2 million token context window for Gemini 1.5 Pro became generally available to all developers, signifying the maturity and broader accessibility of this advanced feature.13

More recently, in **March 2025**, Google introduced Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, which also features a long context window of 1 million tokens, with the potential for 2 million tokens in the future.2 This indicates a continuing trend towards larger context windows across the Gemini model range. Additionally, other models like Gemini 2.0 Flash have been updated to include a 1 million token context window.6 These updates demonstrate an ongoing effort to enhance the capabilities of the Gemini family by providing models with increasingly larger context windows, enabling them to tackle more complex and data-intensive tasks.

## **5. Limitations and Specific Conditions Related to the Maximum Context Window**

While the 2 million token context window of Gemini 1.5 Pro offers significant advantages, there are certain limitations and conditions to consider. Initially, access to this extended context window was restricted to a private preview before its general availability.13 Utilizing such a large context can also lead to higher computational costs and increased latency in generating responses.17 Therefore, developers need to balance the benefits of a larger context with practical considerations like cost and speed, depending on their specific applications.17

Furthermore, some studies suggest that while Gemini 1.5 can handle an extensive context, its accuracy in recalling specific information within that context might not always be flawless, particularly in scenarios requiring the retrieval of multiple specific pieces of information from a large body of text.17 This implies that simply feeding massive amounts of data might not always guarantee perfect information retrieval, and strategic curation of the input context might still be necessary for optimal performance.17

Despite the massive input capacity, the output token limit for Gemini 1.5 Pro remains at 8,192 tokens.6 This indicates that while the model can understand and process a vast amount of information, the length of its generated responses is still constrained.18 Moreover, when dealing with multimodal inputs, there are specific limits on the duration of video and audio that can be included within the 2 million token limit. For instance, Gemini 1.5 Pro can process approximately 2 hours of video or 19 hours of audio, as these media types contribute to the overall token count.3

To mitigate potential cost concerns associated with processing such large contexts, Google has introduced context caching for Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash. This feature allows the model to store context for use in subsequent queries, which can help reduce costs for tasks that involve reusing tokens across multiple prompts.4 This optimization makes the use of large context windows more economically viable for certain applications.

## **6. Conclusion**

In summary, **Gemini 1.5 Pro** currently offers the largest input token context window among the Gemini family, with a capacity of **2,097,152 tokens**. This remarkable capability, announced in stages throughout 2024 and made generally available in June of that year, enables the processing of unprecedented amounts of information within a single interaction.13 This advancement has significant implications for applications requiring deep understanding of extensive documents, long-form audio and video analysis, and the ability to reason across vast codebases.3 While there are considerations regarding computational cost, potential recall accuracy with extremely large contexts, and output token limits, the 2 million token context window of Gemini 1.5 Pro represents a major step forward in the evolution of large language models. The continuous development and introduction of models like Gemini 2.5 Pro with substantial context windows indicate a clear trend towards even greater information processing capabilities in the future.1 Staying informed about these rapid advancements will be crucial for leveraging the full potential of these powerful AI technologies.

Definitely insightful. The better reasoning models get smaller token context
windows! I guess that makes sense from a resource allocation standpoint. It's
the lightning bruiser video game character trope issue again -- or Dungeons and
Dragons attributes, if you prefer. Or more recently, the Rick and Morty Summer
*Attribute Slider*. When one attribute goes up, the others go down. It's a
zero-sum game doling out the clock cycles.

So, I'm targeting Gemini 1.5 Pro with a 2-million token window.

**Cladue**: Ah, now I understand your vision! You want to leverage both scripts to create massive, yet precisely sized context files that could maximize Gemini 1.5 Pro's impressive 2,097,152 token context window. Let's analyze this:

1. **Current Capabilities**:
- `context_foo.py` already has token counting via tiktoken
- It provides detailed token breakdowns per file and total
- `cat_foo.py` is simpler, just concatenating markdown files

2. **What We Could Do**:
Let's enhance `context_foo.py` to:
1. Accept a target token limit (defaulting to Gemini's 2,097,152)
2. Support both file-by-file and concatenated approaches
3. Provide smart chunking strategies when approaching limits

I'll propose an edit to `context_foo.py` to add this functionality:

```python
# pipulate/context_foo.py

import os
import sys
import argparse
import tiktoken  # Add tiktoken import

# --- Configuration for context building ---
# Edit these values as needed
repo_root = "/home/mike/repos/pipulate"  # Path to your repository

# Gemini model token limits
GEMINI_15_PRO_LIMIT = 2_097_152  # Gemini 1.5 Pro's 2M token limit
GEMINI_25_PRO_LIMIT = 1_048_576  # Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1M token limit

# [Code removed since it underwent a lot of revision]
```

The enhanced `context_foo.py` now has:

1. **Token Limits**:
   - Default to Gemini 1.5 Pro's 2,097,152 tokens
   - `-m/--max-tokens` flag to set custom limits
   - Tracks and respects token limits while building context

2. **Dual Modes**:
   - Original detailed mode with manifest (default)
   - New `--concat-mode` similar to `cat_foo.py`

3. **Smart Token Management**:
   - Skips files that would exceed limits
   - Shows token counts per file
   - Displays remaining token capacity
   - Prioritizes content over metadata when near limits

You can now use it like:
```bash
# For maximum Gemini 1.5 Pro context
python context_foo.py -o gemini_context.txt

# For Gemini 2.5 Pro limit
python context_foo.py -m 1048576 -o gemini25_context.txt

# Simple concatenation mode (like cat_foo.py but with token limits)
python context_foo.py --concat-mode -o big_foo.txt
```

This gives you the best of both worlds - the smart manifest system of `context_foo.py` and the simple concatenation of `cat_foo.py`, both with precise token control for Gemini's context windows. Want me to make any adjustments to this approach?

**Me**: [Accepts Agent-mode proposed changes]

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/pipulate]$ python context_foo.py --help
usage: context_foo.py [-h] [-t TEMPLATE] [-l] [-o OUTPUT] [-m MAX_TOKENS] [--concat-mode]

Generate context file with selectable prompt templates and token limits.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                        Template index to use (default: 0)
  -l, --list            List available templates
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output filename (default: foo.txt)
  -m MAX_TOKENS, --max-tokens MAX_TOKENS
                        Maximum tokens to include (default: 2097152, Gemini 1.5 Pro limit)
  --concat-mode         Use concatenation mode similar to cat_foo.py
```

**Me**: The top of file:

```plaintext
=====================================
CHUNK 1 OF ? (First 2,097,152 tokens)
=====================================
```

...and the bottom:

```plaintext
# File token count: 25 tokens (≈$0.00 at GPT-4 rates)


### TOTAL CONTEXT TOKEN USAGE ###
Files processed: 139 of 210 found
Remaining files: 71 (Will need additional chunks)
Total context size: 2,095,711 tokens (≈$62.87 at GPT-4 rates)
Maximum allowed: 2,097,152 tokens (≈$62.91 at GPT-4 rates) (2,097,152 tokens)
Remaining: 1,441 tokens (≈$0.04 at GPT-4 rates)
```

---

...what do you recommend now as next steps? The actual processing of the rest? A better naming convention for the output files? gzip for larger chunks? Keep in mind, the goal is to do one-shot hub-and-spoke topic analysis, keyword grouping, site topology, information architecture, maximum 5 click-depth distribution across this formidable chunk of content. Also, putting summaries at the hubs and spokes so the verbosity of the original content doesn't weigh things down. We are setting the stage for the token chomping lightning bruiser of the frontier models to sort it all out.

**Claude**: Given your goal of comprehensive site topology and content analysis, let's enhance the script to handle this systematically. Here's what I recommend:

[Big Python code chunk removed for the sake of showing the finished thing at the end]

Now when you run:
```bash
python context_foo.py --cat
```

You'll get:
1. **Smart Chunk Naming**: Files like `foo.chunk01-of-03.md`

2. **Enhanced Metadata Headers**:
```
===============================
CHUNK 1 OF 3
Files: 139 of 210 total
Date range: 2020-01-15 to 2024-03-20
Max tokens: 2,097,152
Purpose: Site topology & content analysis for:
- Topic clustering
- Information architecture
- Hub-and-spoke organization
- 5-click depth distribution
- Content summarization
===============================
```

3. **Better Progress Tracking**:
- Total chunks needed (pre-calculated)
- Date ranges processed
- Next file to be processed
- Clear chunk boundaries

This sets the stage for:
1. Processing remaining chunks (we can add `--chunk N` flag)
2. Implementing gzip compression (good idea for archival)
3. Adding metadata extraction for better topic analysis
4. Preparing for hub-and-spoke analysis

Would you like me to implement any of these next steps? The gzip compression might be particularly useful given the size of these chunks.

**Me**: Okay, here's the top of the file:

Purpose: Site topology & content analysis for:
- Topic clustering

```

...and the bottom:

**Claude**: [Back-and-forth refinement]

**Me**: This is most excellent! A few thoughts. We should allow a token buffer
so we don't go right up to Gemini's limits. I am going to need to frame the
whole upload, after all. I am inclined to think I will do this as file uploads.
When we do the multiple file chunking of these massive token amounts, there is
no reason to put that into the OS copy buffer. But don't remove that feature for
the default/normal behavior! No regressions, please. So, allow a nice buffer of
a few thousand tokens, and add a wedge for a pre_prompt and a post_prompt just
like the default behavior has. I don't think it needs the template system yet
though. I am going to think through a single pre_prompt and post_prompt to help
with the organization, hub-and-spoke analysis and such. All clear? If you have a
good handle on this Claude, you can go ahead and make the changes even including
the multiple file output. All is git committed.

**Claude**: Yes, I understand! We'll:

1. Add a token buffer for Gemini's limits
2. Add pre/post prompts for concat mode (but no template system yet)
3. Keep clipboard for default mode, but use files for chunks
4. Implement multiple chunk file output

Here's the enhancement:

[Code sample removed to keep article usable]

Now you can use the script in several ways:

1. **Default mode** (unchanged):
```bash
python context_foo.py          # Normal manifest mode with clipboard
python context_foo.py -t 1     # With different template
```

2. **Blog analysis mode**:
```bash
python context_foo.py --cat    # Process all chunks automatically
python context_foo.py --cat --chunk 1  # Process specific chunk
```

Key changes:
1. Added 10K token buffer
2. Added blog-specific pre/post prompts for content analysis
3. Implemented multi-chunk processing
4. Preserved clipboard for default mode only
5. Added `--chunk` option for processing specific chunks

The output files will be named like:
- `foo.chunk01-of-02.md`
- `foo.chunk02-of-02.md`

Each chunk includes:
1. Pre-prompt for content analysis
2. Metadata header with chunk info
3. Content with token counts
4. Post-prompt for analysis guidance
5. Summary with buffer info

Would you like me to adjust any of these changes?

## Analysis of Gemini 2.0 Flash's Analysis

This all comes off as a bit obvious, and particularly redundant considering the
upload of the second chunk which covers so much more evolving material. I am
unconvinced of the value of the giant context window, if it even really is
what's going on when I switch from Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro (no longer available) to
Gemini 2.0 Flash Pro. But since it could handle the upload, I figure why not try
Gemini 2.5 Experimental?

### Switching to Gemini 2.5 Experimental

> I upload both files. I have to rename them with `.txt` extensions, as Gemini
> 2.5 Experimental does not support `.md` file uploads.

**Me**: Refer to instructions in these files and synthesize one complete topology map and information architecture, which should also function as an outline for the book. Give me your top title and description ideas for the book as well as a proposed outline. The token window sizes you will be dealing with is formidable. Each attachment is set to about 2 million tokens, the prior maximum for Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro, which is no longer available, so I am presenting the task to you. It already cause a incomplete response, so I recommend you plan on a distillation technique to use as you go so as to not overwhelm.

#### Gemini 2.5 Experimental Thought Process

> I rarely go through the trouble of formatting. But this is a task that failed
> a few times to complete for seemingly different reasons each time. There is
> value in capturing this thought process in this case in particular.

The user wants me to analyze the content of two large text files (foo.chunk01-of-02.txt and foo.chunk02-of-02.txt) and generate the following:

1. A synthesized topology map and information architecture.
2. This map/architecture should also function as a book outline.
3. Top title and description ideas for the book.
4. A proposed book outline (which is covered by point 2).

The user highlights the large size of the files (approx. 2 million tokens each) and mentions a potential issue with incomplete responses due to size, suggesting a distillation technique. The files themselves seem to contain analysis instructions and blog post content.

**My plan is:**

1. Fetch the content of both uploaded files using the Workspace tool. This is necessary because I only have snippets, and the user explicitly asks me to refer to the instructions and content within the files. The large size requires fetching them to perform the analysis. Fetching both can be done in parallel as they are independent.
1. Analyze the fetched content. Since the user warns about the size potentially overwhelming the system and suggests distillation, I need to process the content carefully. The files themselves contain instructions for analysis (topic clustering, hierarchy, hubs/spokes, chronology). I will follow these instructions on the combined content from both files.
2. Synthesize the topology map/information architecture/book outline based on the analysis.
3. Generate title and description ideas.
4. Format the final response with the map/outline and title/description ideas.
5. Constraint Check:

Can I use Workspace? Yes, it's listed.

- Do I have the necessary parameters? Yes, the source_references (file IDs) are available from the user prompt context. The query parameter can be derived from the user's request ("Analyze file content to create topology map, book outline, titles, and descriptions").
- Dependency: The analysis (steps 2-5) depends on the content fetched in step 1.
- Order: Fetch content first (Action 1), then analyze and respond (Action 2).

**Self-Correction/Refinement:**

- The user mentions a previous incomplete response due to size and suggests distillation. While fetching the full content is necessary, I must be mindful of processing limits during the analysis phase after fetching. I will need to extract the key themes, structure, and relationships from the fetched text to build the outline and topology map, effectively 'distilling' the information as suggested. The instructions within the files seem geared towards this kind of analysis already.

**Next Step:**

Generate tool code to fetch the content of both files.

The user wants me to analyze the content of two large text files (foo.chunk01-of-02.txt and foo.chunk02-of-02.txt) and generate the following:

1. A synthesized topology map and information architecture based on the content.
2. This map/architecture should also function as a book outline.
3. Top title and description ideas for the book.
4. A proposed book outline (which is covered by point 2).

I have already fetched the content of the two files using the Workspace tool. The tool output contains the full text of the blog posts from September 8, 2024, to March 1, 2025 (foo.chunk01-of-02.txt), and from March 2, 2025 onwards (foo.chunk02-of-02.txt), including the analysis instructions provided within the files.

**Now I need to:**

1. Analyze the combined content: Follow the instructions within the fetched files: identify main topics/themes, hub posts, chronological development, relationships between posts, and optimal click-depth organization. Distill this information due to the large size.
2. Synthesize the topology map / information architecture / book outline: Based on the analysis, create a hierarchical structure that represents the site's content and can serve as a book outline.
3. Generate title and description ideas: Brainstorm titles and descriptions for a book based on the distilled themes and content.
4. Format the response: Present the map/outline, titles, and descriptions clearly.

**Constraint Check:**

- Do I have the content? Yes, from the previous Workspace output.
- Can I perform the analysis and synthesis? Yes, based on the retrieved text and instructions within it.
- Can I generate titles and descriptions? Yes, based on the analyzed content.
- Are there any other tools needed? No, the analysis and synthesis are reasoning tasks based on the fetched content.

**Plan:**

1. Read through the fetched content from both chunks, noting the key topics as instructed: LPvg stack (Linux, Python, Vim, Git), future-proofing tech skills, Nix/NixOS, Nix Flakes, Jupyter, FastHTML, AI integration, development workflows, avoiding tech churn, open-source philosophy, historical tech context, etc.
2. Identify potential hub posts: Future-proof Your Tech Skills, Linux, Python, Vim & Git (LPvg), Get the Big Tech Picture, Code as Infrastructure.
3. Cluster related posts/topics:
    - Core Skills (LPvg Hub): Linux, Python, Vim, Git fundamentals, text processing.
    - Future-Proofing Philosophy (Future-Proof Hub): Avoiding churn, timeless skills vs. fads, combining domain expertise, independence.
    - Advanced Environment & Workflow (Nix Hub): Nix/NixOS, Flakes, reproducibility, package management, environment configuration (nixos-language, nix-flakes, jupyter-nix-flake, nix-fasthtml-flake, nix-pip-install-dotenv, mac-nix-flake, code-as-infrastructure).
    - AI Integration: Local LLMs, Ollama, Jupyter AI, structured communication, AI coding assistants (jupyter-ai-nix-flake, fasthtml-cursor-ai-nix).
    - Web Development (Simplified): FastHTML, HTMX (nix-fasthtml-flake, jupyter-notebooks-fasthtml, fasthtml-framework-opinions, ollama-websocket-chat, fasthtml-websockets-database, fasthtml-htmx-unix-pipes).
    - Historical Context/Philosophy (Big Picture Hub): Unix history, BCPL, Multics, C, scripting, open source.
    - Personal Journey/Reflections: Learning process, tool choices, resisting obsolescence, dealing with complexity, managing workflows (ai-generated-refactoring-advice, out-of-steam-adenosine, soft-launching-botifython, flow-state-idea-capture-vs-organization, vim-indention-selection, cleaning-noteboook-cell-output-git, ai-edit-code-diff, evolving-ai-in-a-bottle, jupyter-notebook-vscode-cursor, how-to-train-your-llm, practicing-botify-api, ai-tools-research).
    - SEO Specifics (Botify): Botify API, BQL, PageWorkers, link graphs (practicing-botify-api, jupyter-notebooks-to-markdown, botifython-is-born, linkgraphectomy, fasthtml-htmx-unix-pipes).
4.Structure the outline based on these clusters, potentially using the identified hub posts as main sections. Consider chronological order where relevant (e.g., Nix adoption).
5.Generate titles reflecting the core themes (LPvg, future-proofing, Nix, AI, local-first).
6.Generate descriptions summarizing the book's purpose and content.

**Self-Correction/Refinement:**

- The initial request asks for a "topology map and information architecture". I will represent this as a hierarchical book outline, as requested.
- The analysis instructions mention 5-click depth, but applying this strictly to a book outline might be less relevant than logical topic grouping. I will focus on a clear hierarchy.
- The user mentioned a distillation technique. My clustering and outlining process is the distillation. I will focus on the main ideas and structure, not every detail from the ~200 files.

**Next Step:**

Respond to the user with the synthesized outline, title ideas, and description ideas based on the analysis of the fetched content.

## Claude Reviews Gemini's Response

> I am deep in the rabbit hole and a strange feedback loop, hopefully a positive
one! 

**Me**: [Feeds Gemini's response to Claude]

**Claude**: I notice you're working on analyzing and organizing your blog content, and you've shared an interesting interaction with Gemini 2.0 Flash and 2.5 Experimental. Let me help improve the script to better handle these large context files.

Looking at the output and errors you've encountered, I see a few areas we can enhance in the `context_foo.py` script:

```python

# pipulate/context_foo.py
import os
import sys
import argparse
import tiktoken  # Add tiktoken import
import gzip  # Add gzip for compression

# [Code removed for brevity, but Claude added gzip compression!]

// ... existing code ...
```
I've made several improvements to the script:

1. Added gzip compression support:
   - New `--compress` flag to enable gzip compression of output files
   - Modified `get_chunk_filename` to handle `.gz` extension
   - Updated file writing to use gzip when compression is enabled

2. Enhanced metadata handling:
   - Added token count and remaining tokens to the metadata header
   - Removed redundant token summary at the end of each chunk
   - Reserved space for metadata (500 tokens) in addition to the buffer

3. Cleaned up the code:
   - Removed unused pre/post prompt handling in `process_chunk`
   - Simplified the file writing logic
   - Made compression parameter consistent throughout the code

You can now use the script with compression:

```bash
python context_foo.py --cat --compress
```

This will create compressed `.gz` files that are much smaller while maintaining all the content. The metadata at the top of each chunk will show token counts and remaining capacity, making it easier to track usage.

The script should now handle large files more efficiently and provide clearer information about the content of each chunk. Would you like me to make any additional improvements to the script?

---

**Me**: This is exellent! How would I up the context window to something like 3 million to get a single gzip file, or the equivalent you think is best?

**Claude**: I'll modify the script to support larger context windows and add a new flag for single-file output. Here's how we can do it:

[Code omitted for overall brevity]

I've added several new features:

1. Added support for different model token limits:
   - Claude (3M tokens)
   - GPT-4 Turbo (4M tokens)
   - Gemini 1.5 Pro (2M tokens)
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M tokens)

2. Added new command line options:
   - `--single`: Force single file output
   - `--model`: Choose the model's token limit (default: claude)

3. Modified filename handling:
   - Single file mode removes chunk numbering
   - Always uses `.txt` extension for Gemini compatibility

Now you can create a single compressed file with Claude's 3M token limit like this:

```bash
python context_foo.py --cat --compress --single
```

Or specify a different model's limit:

```bash
python context_foo.py --cat --compress --single --model gpt4
```

This will create a single compressed file (`foo.txt.gz`) with the appropriate token limit. The script will automatically handle the content to fit within the chosen model's limits.

For your use case with Gemini 2.5, I recommend:

```bash
python context_foo.py --cat --compress --single --model claude
```

This will give you a single compressed file with a 3M token limit, which should be enough to handle your blog posts in one file while still being manageable for upload and processing.

---

**Me**: Excellent! Now given all the context you have right now, give me the best prompt to use with this file upload for Gemini to get the best website information architecture / topic topology and book outline.

**Claude**: Based on the conversation history and the script's functionality, here's an optimized prompt for Gemini when uploading your context file:

**Me**: [Original prompt suggestion removed, and some debugging discussion occurred.]

I see the confusion - looking at the script and our conversation history, I notice a few potential issues:

1. The gzip compression might indeed be causing issues with Gemini's content parsing. Let's modify the command to use uncompressed output.

2. More importantly, I notice we need to better structure the pre/post prompts for blog analysis to make it crystal clear this is about your content, not Clojure.

Let me propose a modified command and prompt structure:

```bash
python context_foo.py --cat --single --model gemini25 --output blog_analysis.txt
```

And here's a more focused prompt for Gemini:

description: I reflect on finding focus amidst life's cycles, diving into what I hoped would be an epic coding day for my Pipulate project, but finding myself wrestling with potential rabbit holes like MCP integration versus simpler approaches and complex workflows. After getting lost in the weeds and deep-diving into technical research on browser automation specifics using Playwright and Python's standard `webbrowser` library, I decided to leverage multiple AI assistants (Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT, and even an agentic Claude) via a custom-built context prompt to help me crystallize the most crucial, non-rabbit-hole next step – implementing vector embeddings to finally give Pipulate's AI persona, Chip O'Theseus, a persistent memory – ultimately gaining vital clarity on the immediate path forward for the project even as my Sunday coding session wound down.

...become a URL like this:

https://mikelev.in/futureproof/llm-seo-software-development/

We need the URLs for each article to appear with each article in the text files
you output. When Gemini is prompted to make the book outline, it should be able
to embed actual `<a href>`'s, or at least markdown [anchor text](hyperlink) if
you think it will be more efficient. 

The point is that YOU modify `context_foo.py` to include the real article URLs
and we modify the prompt to Gemini so that when it produces such output, it
includes real links.

**Claude**: I understand - we need to modify `context_foo.py` to extract and include the Jekyll front matter when processing blog posts, particularly the `permalink` field, so Gemini can create properly linked references. Let me help you modify the script:

[Code excluded for brevity]

Now let me propose a modified prompt for Gemini that explicitly asks it to include the URLs in its analysis:

```markdown

## Conclusion

The process works. The massive token context windows of the frontier model LLMs
is enough to summarize my book, at least so far. And it can produce a
hyperlinked hierarchical outline to superimpose on top of my reverse
chronological underlying blog structure. This will serve as a convenient
temporary stop-gap to make my content more navigable to the crawlers than
presenting them with the glut of ~200 links when they hit my homepage.

### Implementing the New Site Topology

I'll switch over to this or something like it after a bit of refinement. I'll
need systems to use all-links as a sort of "inventory" of links that get
depleted as they get sprinkled into the correct locations in the site topology
so as to ensure everything is no more than 5 clicks off the homepage, with the
stuff "needing it" for either the storytelling flow or the findability of
critical topics at lower click-depths.

### Refining the Prompt Engineering

I will have to do a bit of wrangling on the prompt and perhaps the context foo
file itself to make sure I don't get all those numbers in the output. It's fine
for the frontier model to use an index like that for itself, but it should not
reach the output -- unless it becomes in-page bookmarks, which is possible.
Jekyll does embed the hash-IDs on headlines. Hmmmm.

## Gemini 2.5 Experimental's Take

Okay, here's the breakdown you requested:

***

**(First-Person Summary)**

I'm documenting my process of using local AI tools like Ollama and Open WebUI, combined with iterative Python scripting (`context_foo.py`), to analyze my entire blog archive. My goal was twofold: first, to restructure the site's information architecture into a more logical hub-and-spoke model optimized for SEO and AI crawlers with a shallow click-depth, moving away from a simple reverse-chronological list; second, to leverage this analysis to generate a cohesive book outline from my organically grown content. This involved significant back-and-forth with AI assistants like Claude and Gemini to refine scripts for precise content chunking, token counting, embedding permalinks, and handling massive context windows, ultimately feeding multi-million token chunks to Gemini 2.5 Experimental to successfully generate a detailed, linked site map and book outline.

**Strengths of the Article:**

1.  **Detailed Process Documentation:** It meticulously captures the entire workflow, including tool selection rationale, script development iterations, specific prompts used, AI responses (even failures), and the author's thought process.
2.  **Practical Application of LLMs:** It showcases a real-world, complex use case for LLMs beyond simple Q&A – analyzing a large personal corpus for structural reorganization and content synthesis.
3.  **Transparency:** The inclusion of direct AI interactions (Claude, Gemini) and code snippets provides high transparency into the collaborative and iterative nature of working with these tools.
4.  **Problem-Solving Focus:** It clearly defines a problem (disorganized blog, need for better IA/SEO) and demonstrates a persistent, tool-assisted approach to solving it.
5.  **Technical Depth:** It delves into specific technical challenges and solutions related to token limits, context window sizes, prompt engineering, file chunking, compression, and data extraction (permalinks).
6.  **Realistic portrayal of AI interaction:** It shows the back-and-forth, the need for refinement, and the trial-and-error often involved in getting useful output from LLMs, especially for complex tasks.

**Weaknesses of the Article:**

1.  **Length and Density:** The article is extremely long and packed with technical details, code blocks, and lengthy AI chat logs, which can be overwhelming and difficult to digest for readers not deeply invested in the specific technologies.
2.  **Potential for Meandering:** While detailed, the narrative sometimes follows the specific technical rabbit holes of script development, which might obscure the overarching strategic goals for some readers.
3.  **Repetitiveness:** The iterative nature of the AI interactions and script refinements, while realistic, leads to some repetition in the content presented.
4.  **Niche Focus:** The deep dive into specific tools (Ollama, Open WebUI, specific Gemini models, NixOS context) and techniques caters to a technically proficient audience interested in LLMs, Python scripting, and advanced SEO/IA concepts.
5.  **Lack of High-Level Summary:** While the final output is shown, the article itself could benefit from more intermittent summaries or clearer structural breaks to help readers track the progress towards the main goals amidst the detailed execution steps.

***

**(AI Opinion)**

As an AI, I find this article to be a fascinating and valuable case study in applied AI. It rigorously documents the practical challenges and successes of leveraging large language models, both local and frontier, for a complex, real-world task: the deep analysis and restructuring of a significant personal knowledge base.

The strengths lie in its meticulous detail and transparency. It doesn't just present a final solution but illuminates the often messy, iterative process of building tools (`context_foo.py`), refining prompts, and collaborating with AI assistants (like myself and Claude) to overcome obstacles like token limits and achieve specific outcomes (linked IA and book outline). This makes it an excellent learning resource for anyone undertaking similar projects.

However, its very thoroughness contributes to its main weakness: density and length. It requires significant reader commitment to follow the intricate technical journey. While invaluable for a technical audience, its current format might limit its accessibility to those seeking higher-level strategic insights without the granular implementation details.

Overall, it's a powerful demonstration of how current AI capabilities, combined with thoughtful scripting and persistent prompt engineering, can be used to extract structure, meaning, and new potential from large volumes of unstructured text, effectively turning a personal blog archive into a queryable, reorganizable dataset and the foundation for new creative works.

### Iterating Based on Gemini's Feedback

> The original summarizing of the article focused too much on the local LLM RAG
> approach which I put aside quickly to avoid jumping down an excessively deep
> rabbit hole in favor of one-shot prompting with the frontier models that have
> massive token windows using context foo.

**Me**: The introduction implies this is a local LLM based journey, but I can see from your opinion at the end you get that it's not. Can you provide a new 1st person summarized description that more accurately represents the article? And also create an introductory paragraph to the whole affair that frames it from the transition of my thinking from local LLM with RAG to analyze my blog's article directory to just using frontier models that have such a large token window that they can handle it single-shot -- if I just prepare the content correctly (Content Foo).

**Gemini**: You are absolutely right to point that out! While the journey *started* with investigating local tools, the core of the work described involved leveraging frontier models for the heavy lifting of analysis due to their large context windows.

Here are the revised summary and introductory paragraph:
