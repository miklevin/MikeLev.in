title: I'm Live streaming YouTube again More Freely Than Before
headline: Mastering Cloud Notebook Hosts to Become an Advanced SEO
description: In this blog post, I discuss the rapidly evolving Bard user interface issues and how they compare to Bing's implementations. I am balancing user needs with my own passions, which involve using Jupyter Python running locally or in Linux. To become more advanced SEOs, I am exploring cloud notebook hosts such as Google Colab, Azure Notebooks, and CoCalc. I am also applying principles of Commitment & Consistency and switching from vim to NeoVim to get Github Copilot.

I am communicating to our content team the rapidly evolving Bard user interface
issues, it trying to catch up with Bing that has set expectations by providing
some very good implementations on providing citations and copy/paste links on
the responses. Don't want to derail the meeting, but do want to get in these
breaking developments.

I have to balance what the Moz users need versus my passions. I am internally
quite convinced that what the Moz users need is cheerleading and a proven
formula on becoming slightly more advanced SEOs. And all my work is Jupyter
Python running local on your machine, and under Linux in particular. That's
very advanced, no matter how easy Microsoft and myself are making it for
people.

None-the-less, I have to dive into this stuff for myself as to not fall behind.
Changes in the industry are so fast right now in particular that if I don't do
this recalibrating right now, it will be that much harder to catch up later.

I am basically tweaking my new baseline capabilities. It was expected, but
still an awakening it happened so fast, that Python sandboxes were being
provided for OpenAI ChatGPT plugins. Get through the first round of this
process ASAP! Simplify!

The stuff I'm doing right now is way too advanced for MOZ content. The focus of
anything I do has to meet our customers at their comfort level. However, I make
the argument that life starts outside your comfort level. I am receiving advice
that I use Google Colab as the onramp to Jupyter and I know where that's coming
from, but also I want to lead people to the powerful direction.

Once you're on Colab or Azure Notebooks or Binder or any of the other of these
vast array of hosted Notebook choices, there's no going to the native install.
They already basically spent their willingness to try something new, and they
spent it on developing a new vendor/cloud dependency, that of hosted notebook
providers. Present the options up front and get to the conclusion that you can
do things with the local install that you just can't do with the hosted
versions. Those things include:

- Coming from an IP that's not the cloud-provider's
- Being able to change your IP with easy-to-use desktop VPN software
- Being able to do Browser automation with Playwright/Puppeteer
- Processing the data locally so you can double-click results into Excel

My first piece will probably be an example of the types of things you can do
with Jupyter. Wet their appetite with some big wins. Dispel their fear and help
them to take the first baby steps outside their comfort zones.

My next call is at 1:00 PM, and what I want to do after that call is to
live-cast the rest of the day. And so what I should do is roughly script that
live-casting session so I can keep jumping back over here to keep myself
on-track. Okay, 1, 2, 3... 1?

Practice live-casting again. Do a quickie! Maybe interview Bing and Bard about
the many ways to run Jupyter, providing advantages and disadvantages. And let
people see me work here in vim live again. Yes! Wrap it up quickly.

## BING: list ways to run Jupyter

There are several ways to run Jupyter notebooks. Here are some of them:

1. **Standard Jupyter servers**: You can run one of the standard Jupyter notebooks servers by installing the server in your Python environment, and then running the server and connecting to it via a browser¹.
2. **IDE integration**: You can execute notebooks via your Integrated Development Environment (IDE)¹.
3. **Hosted services**: You can execute notebooks via hosted services¹.
4. **The command line**: You can run Jupyter Notebook within a specific folder by typing `jupyter notebook` in the command prompt³.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## BARD: list ways to run Jupyter

Here are some ways to run Jupyter:

* Use the Jupyter Notebook App.
* Use a command-line interface.
* Use the Notebook Viewer.
* Use the Notebook Compiler.

The Jupyter Notebook App is the most user-friendly way to run Jupyter. It is a
web-based application that allows you to create and edit Jupyter notebooks. To
use the Jupyter Notebook App, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook and
then navigate to the directory where you want to create your notebook. Once you
are in the correct directory, you can create a new notebook by clicking on the
"New Notebook" button.

The command-line interface is a more technical way to run Jupyter. It allows
you to create and edit Jupyter notebooks from a terminal. To use the
command-line interface, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook and then
navigate to the directory where you want to create your notebook. Once you are
in the correct directory, you can create a new notebook by typing the following
command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

The Notebook Viewer is a tool that allows you to view Jupyter notebooks without
having to edit them. To use the Notebook Viewer, you will need to have the
Jupyter Notebook installed. Once you have installed the Jupyter Notebook, you
can view a notebook by clicking on the "View" button.

The Notebook Compiler is a tool that allows you to compile Jupyter notebooks
into Python scripts. To use the Notebook Compiler, you will need to have the
Jupyter Notebook installed. Once you have installed the Jupyter Notebook, you
can compile a notebook by clicking on the "Compile" button.

## BING: List the cloud notebook host like Google Colab, Asure Notebook and others.

Here are some cloud notebook hosts similar to Google Colab and Azure Notebook:

1. **Kaggle**: Kaggle provides free browser-based Jupyter Notebooks and GPUs⁵.
2. **Amazon SageMaker**: Amazon SageMaker notebook runs on the Jupyter Notebook App¹.
3. **IBM DataPlatform Notebooks**: IBM DataPlatform Notebooks is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment¹.
4. **Jupyter Notebook**: You can run Jupyter Notebook in the cloud¹.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Bard:** List the cloud notebook host like Google Colab, Asure Notebook and others.

Here are some cloud notebook hosts:

* Google Colab: A free cloud service that provides access to Jupyter Notebooks and Google's computing resources.
* Azure Notebooks: A cloud-based service that provides access to Jupyter Notebooks and Microsoft's Azure computing resources.
* CoCalc: A cloud-based service that provides access to Jupyter Notebooks and a variety of programming languages and software tools.
* Kaggle Kernels: A cloud-based service that provides access to Jupyter Notebooks and Kaggle's dataset library.
* Binder: A cloud-based service that provides access to Jupyter Notebooks and a variety of programming languages and software tools.

These services allow you to run Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud, which can be helpful if you need to access powerful computing resources or if you need to share your work with others.

They're great when you want to do exactly what everyone else is doing in
exactly the same way as everyone else without the advantages that the power of
your desktop brings to the picture. That's where competitive advantage resides.
And it doesn't really have to be difficult.

You don't need to use vim like I'm doing here. Let's separate those issues. I
advocate and am passionate about a few different things. They're not all
required out of the starting gate.

There's some really easy ways to get started.

I fear explaining how to do cloud Jupyter hosts, because you're leaving all the
real power on the table. But why not crawl before you walk? If I lay the issues
out very clearly at the outset, I can help folk go from Colab to local
Linux-based Jupyter later.

What am I doing?

I am applying the principles of Commitment & Consistency as laid out in the
seminal marketing book Influence (a.k.a. The Art of Persuasion) by Robert
Cialdini.

I'm likely switching from vim to NeoVim so I can get Github Co-Pilot in THIS
environment.

What am I doing (again)?

I am live-casting much more freely during the work day than I did before,
because in my last capacity at ZD, all my deliverables are closely kept
proprietary secrets. In my new capacity at ZD/MOZ, all my deliverables belong
to you. And there are some good ones. This is all for my day-job, even though
this first step right now is calibrating to the new world order under ChatBots
that I must accommodate to, or be left behind. RESEARCH!

I believe in Linux, Python, vim & git as a sort of eternal tech platform. If
you know it plus whatever, you'll never go obsolete. You are future-proofed. I
believe that so strongly that having to move off vim just makes my point.

As the world changes, your mastery of vim (muscle memory similar to driving)
carries over to the new vi-based platform.
