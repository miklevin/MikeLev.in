title: Running Automated Script on NAS 24x7 Under LXD Container
headline: "Learning LXD and Container Station: My Journey to Automate Tasks on my NAS 24x7!"
description: I'm documenting my journey of learning about Container Station and LXD, and how I successfully set up a long-running script in a Linux Container on my QNAP NAS. I've already created two YouTube videos to document the process, and now I'm working on changing the script into a Python one and making it do something to remind me of something daily. Follow my journey and learn how to set up your own Linux Container!

Hello World! I just did the final step so that my LXD Linux Container running
in my "home cloud" (QNAP NAS / not my laptop) just as capable as the ones I'm
running directly on my laptop. So LXD Linux Containers are now my main vehicle
for development work (expressing myself with infotech tools).

I've been learning Container Station on my QNAP NAS. I've also been learning
LXD which that's based on, which uses the command lxc for everything except the
initialization. But time in tooling is just about over. I've pivoted to where I
need to be to not be clobbered by the proprietary.

Go one small step at a time. On the next video, do the 2 great tricks that work
great together. Do I add the .screenrc? Don't get too ambitious with a single
video. Just take one chisel-strike. Okay, but go do the set-up work. Get a
long-running script running.

Okay, keep building it up. Nothing too big. Change your Unix Script busy-loop
into a Python one. Don't add moving parts yet. Just change the moving parts.

Okay, got that video out:

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="l_HdPSYBm6I" %}

That went well but now we should make it do something to remind us. To keep
pushing us to do something daily.
