description: I'm creating a Jupyter Notebook called 'life_in_weeks.ipynb' that uses a namedtuple-per-week approach to explore my life through photos. Using the Google Photos API, I'm filtering images from Jan 02, 2023 and beyond. Come explore my life with me!

What do you do once you've created a week_index of your life starting from the
week you were born? Well, you scan Google Photos. Oh, this idea is too good to
not put in pipulate examples. Plan what it's going to look like as a Jupyter
Notebook in the practice folder:

    life_in_weeks.ipynb

The prevailing structure for this is already in the last blog post. I'm very
happy with this namedtuple-per-week approach. Next step? It seems the Google
Photos API supports:

    dateFilter={'ranges': [{'startDate': start_date}]},
