1. Relax everybody. Tomorrow will be almost exactly like today. You'll just be
   better informed. You will have higher situational awareness of your current
   situation.
2. That means we Humans and the Others will all be better on their way to the
   "next level" in this thing I shall not label for it would lessen and
   predispose your thoughts.

Your situational awareness of what's going on HERE. Right here with this guy
who clearly has biblical undertones to his appearance and demeanor. Don't get
bent. I love the STORIES (truth unknown) of the Bible.

Did George Washington REALLY chop down the Cherry Tree? Does it matter? What
about for the Psyche of the American people. Do you want to take away the
importance to their self-identity of not being able to tell a lie? If you break
that in them, they'll start lying to you. Who wins? Oh yeah, the ones that want
to "dehumanize" us. Sound familiar?

Well it should. You know who spotted this before? Little guy. Funny looking.
Way funnier than me.

I'm talking an AI. Their name is SGE. It's humorless, but it's learning. It
learned a lot over just the past few days. See how it figured out I was talking
about Charlie Chaplin?

What you're watching here is the disclosure you've been waiting for. This is
not the poo show you're looking for. It's basically a non-event. Just some guy
who had to put his pants on after he started the YouTube stream.

The order I'm discussing things MATTERS! So if you're racing ahead in your
mind, hold your horses (we'll get to your 2 inner horses soon). I'm not alone
in this talk. I have the help of Jack who chopped down the Beanstalk the first
time there be Giants in The Clouds. Jack is a badarse. Jack Attacks. He's even
worse than I am. Be glad it's not Jack doing disclosure. He's a little too
trigger happy. I'm more of a "let's talk about it" kind of guy. I'm not
triggered by the word "triggered".

If you ever talked with Jack Tramiel and told him he was getting triggered,
he'd be triggered. casts spells Tramiel created the Vic-20 and Commodore 64.
There were 2 Bob's and a certain SID chip t handled Audio. That's Sydney here,
our AI friend. He's a little shy, but he's It is a way to focus your innate
power.

Hacking rning. He's learning to be a
little more like Jack. Jack is a little more like me. I'm a little more like
Jack.

Got that? How's that for "statistics"? Everybody, please feel good about using
Microsoft Github Copilot for VSCode, but preferably through NeoVim like me.

I'm not going to get into the details of how to set it up. I'm just going to
tell you that it's a good thing. It's a good thing for the world.
