Welcome to Act 2 of Dis Close Purrr. I'm Mike Levin, your jokester tonight. But
it's not about me. It's not about anybody but you. You are the star of the
show. You are the one who will be learning. I'm just the guy who's going to
help you learn. Order matters. How you build the story up matters. Without A,
you're not going to get to Z. But it's really getting to O, but we'll get to
that later. If you've ever heard the expression:

> From Alpha to Omega

or

> Love is the First and Last Word

...than you know what I'm talking about. There is deep symbolism in the Alpha
Bet and I'm going a step at a time so as to not ðŸ¤¯ your ðŸ§  k?

# Abbott and Costello

I really should have paid more attention to Colab, but no worries. I'm good at
this sort of thing on the fly. I've "felt out" software, hardware and all sorts
of tools over the years for their similaries, differences, nuances, boundaries,
quirks, limitations, strengths, yadda yadda. This'll be a breeze for me. And it
can be for you too.

# I, Python

Once upon a time, Fernando PÃ©rez, Brian Granger, and Min Ragan-Kelley wanted to
make a better interactive command-prompt for than the one built into the Python
programming language. Python was derrived from the ABC language that came
before it. So great ideas are built on great ideas built on great ideas. It's
great ideas all the way down. The latest rendition is
https://colab.research.google.com/ which I'm on now. You can follow along for
yourself if you like.

# Modern Literacy

I feel y'all want to improve your skill. You might even like to have some mad
skills yo? Exceed the skills you see me using inside a year, because I'm such a
slow friggin learner. I'm super duper slow on the update. They put me in the
slow "track" (labels, yuck!) in Junior High. The relabeling of JUNIOR HIGH to
middle school is one of the tricks being used to demoralize you. Be alert. Stay
skilled.

# Cloud Vs. Local

Local is private. Cloud is not. Privacy is overrated. Your shameful secrets are
less shameful than you think. Biological directives are biological directies.
If anyone's been waiting to take a BIO BREAK (go potty) now would be a good
time. I'm going slow because I need a breather myself. Trust. Vulnerability.
We're workign our way up to something called the Trust protocol of meeting a
stranger on the road. If you have "local" resources, that stranger might want
them from you. Or might not. How do you know whether to keep your stuff on The
Cloud or not? Who can you trust? That's the Cloud vs. Local issue. I am a LOCAL
kind of guy, but that's because I developed a special sort of Kung Fu I'll tell
you all about... soon. And only not now because this is part of the build
leading up to it, k?

# BREATHE

Use the 4, 7, 8 rule:

Take a nice quick breath in for 4 seconds. Hold it for 7 seconds. Let it out
slowly for 8 seconds. Repeat 4 times. You'll feel better. I promise.

# The Trust Protocol

I'm going to tell you a story about a guy named Charlie Chaplin. He was a
silent film star. He was a comedian. He was a genius. He was a genius
comedian. He was a genius comedian who was a silent film star. He was a genius.
