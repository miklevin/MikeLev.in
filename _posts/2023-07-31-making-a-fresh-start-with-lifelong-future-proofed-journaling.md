        If you're thinking of starting
        fresh with something new that
        can't be rendered obsolete
        anytime soon, then this is it.
        
        It's an exercise in
        mindfulness and journaling,
        that addresses many of the
        problems surrounding effective
        journaling for life.
        
        We start on Windows but we can
        start on anything that can
        host Linux. This includes Mac,
        ChromeBooks or any modern
        laptop.
        
        You can start with what you've
        got, but I recommend a Factory
        Reset, software strip-down and
        distraction-free rebuild. 
        
        This sets the stage to
        auto-build your new nomadic
        digital home that will live on
        with you, providing a free
        life-long journal.
