headline: Surviving Google's 'Helpfulgeddon' - How I'm Differentiating My Content from the Endless Deluge
description: I recently tested out ChatGPT and was amazed by the results. With its help, I'm ready to start fresh and create a better site by looking at data from Google Analytics, Search Console, and others. I plan to focus on creating content that will help others learn Linux, Python, vim, and git, and will listen to feedback from my audience. Join me as I strive to differentiate my inner voice from the endless content deluge and make the most of SEO principles that still work.

After all the hype about ChatGPT lately, I decided to dive in and give it a go
yesterday. I kicked the tires earlier when it was announced, but not until
Sunday did I run a few tests which included:

- Seeing what ChatGPT knew about Linux.
- Seeing what ChatGPT knew about Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Seeing What ChatGPT knew about my field of SEO (search engine optimization)
- Asking ChatGPT to tell a story that connects the dots between these three.

The results were as startlingly cool to me as they've apparently been to the
rest of the world over the past week or two. ChatGPT does change things. It
does write better than most humans. Maybe not better than a human writer, but
hey come on, how many humans really write? It's a lot like reading books. You
get out of school, and that's basically the last book most human adults have
ever read, much less continuing to refine writing skills throughout life.
That's where ChatGPT steps in.

This makes me reflective. In my field of SEO, if doorway pages and low-value
content was easy to produce before, well now we can just have new content
flowing out onto the Internet for little more reason than media-manipulation at
a faster rate than all the readers of content in the world could ever consume.
Humanity has basically just created infinite never-ending stories of a
reasonable quality. Those who like mental candy that doesn't dive deep into
nutritional value for the mind and soul would probably be perfectly happy
skimming ChatGPT output in their feeds for the rest of their lives.

Something's going to change. All the content we made in the past of this sort
is going to be caught up in the sort of filters Google and others must
implement to contend with the content deluge. That's probably why Google is
taking away the estimated number of pages on a site when you do a Google search
with the site: modifier. It used to (and still does sometimes) give an
estimated count of how many pages Google knows about and is willing to serve
from a site, and people in my industry could use that as a clue of how well we
were doing. Bigger site, bigger net, more traffic no more.

So what to do?

### Step #1: Forget the past

The principles of SEO that have worked for so many years have been based, more
or less, on the stupidity of the process. PageRank and all the other layered-on
processes, while effective at first, are easily gamed. Pile on the in-bound
links, keep tweak "striking distance" pages based on SEO best practices, and
write new content based on GAP Analysis, linking them into your site structure
to reinforce page-topic. Lather, rinse, repeat. We used to think of our sites
as nets to capture traffic and a big role of the SEO was to make that net both
larger and tighter-kit. Forget all that. A world of tight-knit nets throws off
the rules of the game. The signal-to-noise ratio suffers. Web content becomes
less helpful. The whole search system collapses under its own weight.

### My Long-Tail Didn't Migrate

Not long ago, I migrated my main site off of WordPress. I tried to keep all the
blog URLs in-place so as to not lose all that long-tail traffic that kept
pouring in. For lack of any better pages on the Internet, if you published a
page that had all the words of the search on the page, yours would be served.
This is no longer true. Google filters those long-pages that go for pure
probability-driven big keyword intersection-matrices. The long-tail is being
filtered. The great unwashed masses are no longer being listened to. New
smarter processes look at a broader array of signals and make determinations
about what pages should be served on what keywords more as a human would. My
site never recovered after the migration.

### Step #2: Nuke The Place From Orbit

How could this not be an opportunity? I can conduct tests now without fear of
losing past assets, because those assets have been mostly burned. I'll retire
tons of content, probably keeping the URLs intact, but otherwise removing all
links to them, sending them into a deep, deep archive from which I could pull
things out again, but for now it's best to lay a new and better site on top of
the same space, only occasionally keeping the old URLs and content that are
actually still working. And I'll essentially do this from scratch, looking at
the data of Google Analytics, Search Console and others. Clean mind. Clean
slate. As one of my favorite and most misquoted movie lines goes: Nuke the
place from orbit, it's the only way to be sure.

    Don't you see Simplicity
    Is what the mind is craving?
    Make it so And truth will glow
    Just like the path you're paving.

The next step is the tricky one.

Commit.

And then become consistent about your commitment.

And then listen to feedback and treat it as manipulatable data.

Learn and teach the skills you're learning about collecting and manipulating
data.

Listen particularly closely to the highly engaged, interested or otherwise
interactive in your audience. You've connected with them. This is Calvin,
Luke, Scott, Joe, ZoroNoa01, ComputerChronicles and others.

So what do I bring to the table really, with my original content?

Well, a clear path onto Linux, Python, vim & git (for the uninitiated). Yeah,
sounds cult-ish. So be it.

We all have an inner voice. We do channel. Shhh! You hear that? That's not your
inner voice. That's the sound of my voice in your head. Your inner voice told
you to let me in.. That's entanglement.

Much of what you think is your inner voice is the happenstance entanglements
that hang on in your head as a result of your circumstance in life. You can
start the process of sorting you from them right now.
