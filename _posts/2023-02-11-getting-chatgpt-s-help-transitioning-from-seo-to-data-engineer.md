Alright, how many people out there in the SEO industry can say they can
remember themselves still being wrangled into into it by nature of the fact you
were a skilled Webmaster? Being a Webmaster was bigger than being an SEO back
in those days. Webmasters could do, and had to do it all, because there were no
specialists. At least there were no like SQL specialists or even software
low-end and cheap enough to be the infrastructure for websites. And so the free
and open source software movement. And so MySQL. And so cometh the Oracle who
gobbles you up whole because FOSS database poses a threat. Java? Munch, munch.
It was just an appetizer that came with Sun Microsystems. We will have no NoSQL
before it's time BerkeleyDB munch, much. And so on down through decades of
stifled innovation and adapting FOSS community, and like breeding a super-bug,
the already viral Linux infects even Microsoft Windows. Deeply infects.

Nobody gets it. I feel it shall be my role to illuminate the masses, lead the
way and other narcissistic nonsense, but my old Amiga freak friends know what
I'm talking about. We've been there, done that, been disappointed by so much,
that this is the first time anything really interesting s happened since The
Amiga. Game consoles are lost on me, because of where I'm investing my
muscle-memory training time. I know the resources and instincts those games
tap. No thank-you.

All that muscle-memory training energy's going into me getting better at vim.
Vim is almost like my thought-processing operating system, but never as much so
as emacs is for an eMacs user. The kind of meta I imply exists most fully
expressed (and potentially expressible?) in the LISP world. The legacy of
operating systems, time-sharing, bizarro alternate universe-like world that
would have been if the workstations during the rise of Jurassic Park-like
computer graphics (CGI) took off. If you have enough capacity to explore worlds
beyond the bare-minimum I consider necessary for modern tech literacy: Linux,
Python, vim & git, then it ought to add LISP. I don't know LISP enough as to
say Scheme or Common LISP or Clojure. All I know is Paul Graham totally got to
me. There is no language like...

Hey ChatGPT: What was Paul Graham's essay on a proposed "best" computer language?

You might be referring to Paul Graham's essay "Beating the Averages," which was published in 2001. In this essay, Graham proposed a new programming language, called Arc, that he believed would be a "better" language than existing ones in several ways. He argued that Arc would be easier to learn, more flexible, and more powerful than existing programming languages, and that it would enable developers to write more maintainable and scalable code.

In the essay, Graham also discussed his experiences with building successful startups and the role that programming languages play in determining a startup's success. He argued that a good programming language could give a startup a significant advantage over its competitors and help it to quickly outpace them.

While Arc has since been developed and used by some, it never became a widely adopted programming language. Nevertheless, Graham's essay remains a popular and influential piece in the tech community, and continues to be widely discussed and debated.

Hey ChatGPT: No, not the one that begins with an A. I mean the one that begins with a B. Boy, Paul really covers his A, B, C's, doesn't he?

You may be referring to Paul Graham's essay "The Hundred-Year Language". This essay was published in 2005 and in it, Graham proposed the idea of a "100-year language," which he defines as a programming language that would be so well designed that it would last for at least a hundred years, or even longer.

In the essay, Graham discussed the limitations of existing programming languages and what a "100-year language" would look like. He argued that such a language would be easy to learn and use, but also incredibly powerful, allowing developers to write code that is concise, expressive, and easy to understand. He also emphasized the importance of keeping the language simple and avoiding features that would make the language too complex.

While the idea of a "100-year language" remains just that, an idea, Graham's essay has been widely read and discussed in the tech community and has had a significant impact on the way that many people think about programming languages and their design.

**ChatGPT:** While very interesting, that doesn't start with a B, now does it? Now, the essay is has something like the world Blurg or Blurb. It's an argument for LISP.

Yes, you're thinking of Paul Graham's essay "Blub Paradox." This essay was published in 2003 and it presents Graham's argument for why LISP is the best programming language.

In the essay, Graham uses the "Blub Paradox" to illustrate his point. He argues that if you compare LISP to other popular programming languages, such as Java or C++, LISP might seem less capable or less powerful, just like the fictional language Blub might seem less capable than a more advanced language. However, Graham argues that this is only because LISP has a different way of thinking about programming, and that its simplicity and expressiveness actually make it a more powerful language for many tasks.

The essay is widely read in the tech community and remains an influential piece on the topic of programming languages and their design. Graham's arguments in "Blub Paradox" continue to be debated and discussed by programmers and computer science enthusiasts alike.

**ChatGPT:** I would suggest that while Paul is technically correct, that LISP is the objectively best programming language because of its unique meta capabilities, most people want shortchuts. Specifically, most people want the best shortcuts that work easily and as expected in the most common use cases most of the time. Minimal extra effort beyond "accepting the defaults" should have to go into using a tool except when you're deviating from the most common use cases, and this would drive the popularity of the ideal shortcut language. Speculate what properties this shortcut language might have.

The ideal shortcut language that you describe, which provides shortcuts for common use cases with minimal extra effort, would likely have the following properties:

1. Easy to learn: The language would be designed with a gentle learning curve and would use intuitive syntax and structures that are easy for new users to understand.
1. Readability: The language would prioritize readability, making it easy for others to understand and maintain code written in the language.
1. High-level abstractions: The language would provide high-level abstractions for common programming tasks, allowing developers to write more code with fewer lines.
1. Portability: The language would be designed to be portable and run on a variety of platforms, so that developers can write code once and run it anywhere.
1. Popularity: The language would have a large and active community of users and developers, making it easy to find answers to questions and get help with problems.
1. Good performance: The language would be designed to be fast and efficient, allowing developers to write code that runs quickly even in complex or demanding applications.
1. Robust libraries and tools: The language would have a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and frameworks that make it easier to build complex applications.
1. Interoperability: The language would be designed to be compatible with other popular programming languages and tools, so that developers can easily integrate it into their existing workflows.

Of course, these are just general guidelines, and the specific properties of the ideal shortcut language will depend on the needs and preferences of different communities of developers. However, by prioritizing these features, a language could become widely adopted and become the preferred choice for many developers seeking to write code with minimal extra effort.

Hey ChatGPT: Would a language such as this still be of value to learn and know as a human being, even though in a few years AIs will be able to code better than any human. It's reasonable to believe that the level of intelligence and intuition demonstrated by deep learning systems masting the games of Go and Chess will be applied to every endeavor that was once a challenge or a skill or a craft or even creative outlet for humans. What point is it even taking up any endeavor when you know some machine somewhere will ultimately be able to do it better than you?

Even if artificial intelligence systems can perform programming tasks more effectively and efficiently than humans, there will still be a value in learning and knowing a programming language as a human being.

First, AI systems may be better at performing certain tasks, but they are limited by their programming and the data they have been trained on. Humans, on the other hand, bring a unique perspective and creativity to the table that AI systems cannot replicate.

Second, learning a programming language can be a valuable skill for many different careers, and a good understanding of programming concepts can be useful even if you are not a programmer by trade. In today's technology-driven world, being able to understand and work with code can be a valuable asset in many different fields.

Finally, even if AI systems can perform programming tasks better than humans, the process of learning a programming language can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience in its own right. It can challenge your problem-solving skills and help you develop new ways of thinking about the world.

In short, while AI systems may be able to perform programming tasks more effectively, there is still value in learning and knowing a programming language as a human being. Whether for career development, personal growth, or simply for the enjoyment of the experience, learning to code can be a valuable and rewarding endeavor.

Hey ChatGPT: These are all really good ideas, thank you ChatGPT. I also have two other endeavors. They are my personal website, MikeLev.in where I host a blog at https://mikelev.in/blog and a site called Pipulate where I am trying to start a free and open source software movement using a series of tutorial Jupyter Notebooks that run in a Linux version of JupyerLab on WSL on Windows 10 or 11 with a special "drink me" install.bat that I wrote. People can follow along if they run that .bat file on their Windows 10 or 11 machine and install WSL with an instance of Ubuntu 20.04 that hosts the Linux version of JupyerLab server, which is accessible with a Windows browser like Edge at http://localhost:8888. I think getting JupyterLab running like this and using the examples in the practice folder that gets set up is the best way to start making the transition from somewhat technical and ambitious SEO to full-fledged Data Engineer. I plan on engineering a transition to a new career capable of extending the field of SEO to be capable of keeping pace with the developments of AI. Help me make this argument.
