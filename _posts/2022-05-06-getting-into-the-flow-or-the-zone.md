title: Getting Into The Flow Or The Zone
headline: "Unlocking Productivity and Focus: My Journey to Re-Achieve the Flow During the Covid-19 Lockdown"
description: For the past 15 years, I've been struggling to get into the flow while working in a cubicle. But thanks to the Covid-19 lockdown, I've been able to re-achieve this state of productivity and focus -- just like in the Disney Pixar movie Soul. Working from home has allowed me to block out distractions and become more productive, and I'm exploring the concept of 'feeding the love-worthiness of things'. Read my blog post to learn more about my journey!

Being able to get into the flow or the zone on-demand is such a wonderful gift,
or as it seems, developed ability. As a programmer who has had to work in the
cubicle environment for the greater part of the past 15 years, it was an
ability that was agonizingly denied to me.  Getting knocked out of the zone is
a trigger. With lockdown and quarantine, I've had the opportunity to re-achieve
this state again.

Working from home can help if you can actually block the distractions. For some
people it may be exactly the reverse, but ever since the trend of offices has
plummeted in the workplace, so had my programming productivity. Happily, it is
back! Not everyone can, but at home I find I can filer out those things
interruptions about 1000x better than in an office cubicle.

The ability to get into the zone is heavily tied to my "feeding the
love-worthiness of things" concepts. An interesting spin was put on it in the
Disney Pixar movie Soul where people who do it to excess (collectors and such)
living too far removed from objective reality and actually go into dark places.
I haven't heard that spin on it before. Honestly I wish I had the opportunity
for being in the zone so much for it to be a pitfall.
