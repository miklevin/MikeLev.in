## Today’s Mission: Bringing It All Together

Today is the day I bring it all together.

- I have a new web framework I built on **FastHTML** that lets me do web dev without the usual allergic reaction.
- The web framework runs alongside a **local LLM** under Ollama, tuned into every move.
- I’ve set up a Matrix-like **“Kung Fu download”** process that makes the LLM an expert on what it needs when it needs it.
- I have the actual **Kung Fu downloads** ready to make big cloud AIs capable enough to help me.
- I have **sample websites** prepared to visualize (the sample input data).

## Organizing File Naming and Structure

Time to tackle file naming and organization. Sexy, I know, but this kind of project can spiral out of control fast if files end up scattered, lumped into one directory, or following a messy naming convention. Excessively deep file paths? No thanks—a database? Nope, the **filesystem is a database** for many use cases like this.

The visualizer will need a couple of **.csv** files per visualization, which can go into a single folder per client. Clients, however, need to be kept separate, and different projects within each client need clear separation. Luckily, the `org` and `project` input fields of the app provide the perfect structure for directory creation.

So, a `downloads` directory is a must. The link-graph visualization app will live there, but since the web server hosts multiple apps, each app will need a dedicated subfolder in `downloads`. So far, we’ve got:

    downloads / link_graph / org / project

I’m tempted to add an `analysis` folder next, but I think drilling down to the project level is enough. Crawls are often monthly, yielding two files per crawl, so even 24 files per year is manageable. Since this is a local app living on each person’s desktop (similar to apps like VSCode or Slack), it’s unlikely any folder will grow unwieldy over time. Plus, this setup is optimal for people who want to browse the files directly.

## Choosing the Right Python Execution Context

Now, coding brings an interesting choice with four Python coding and execution contexts in play. Ideally, I’d consolidate, but each serves a unique purpose.

### 1. Cursor AI and Claude

Cursor AI recently got under my skin. I despise VSCode with a passion—especially that fuzzy-search file navigation on the left panel—but Cursor AI with Anthropic’s Claude is just too useful to ignore. It’s a productivity accelerator, even for a devout vim-head like me. And yes, I tried Copilot in NeoVim, but it’s not the same.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks

Then there’s Jupyter Notebooks, which I used to despise but now grudgingly accept. Not Google Colab—I’m keeping an open mind, but it’s not my go-to. Instead, I use local JupyterLab, which offers a few extra tricks beyond the classic Jupyter interface. It’s great for testing, rapid prototyping, and experimenting with Jupyter AI. This is where I make the Kung Fu downloads.

### 3. The Command Line

Running things from the command line is crucial. If you’re not occasionally typing `python filename.py`, you’re not future-proofing yourself. The command line rules all—it’s how every AI ultimately launches. And it’s universal: Mac’s default terminal, Linux’s shell, and Windows’s WSL. IDEs use it behind the scenes, and it forces you to confront Python’s path issues.

### 4. The Web App Server

Lastly, there’s the web app itself: a long-running `server.py` script. All computer services are essentially busy loops, running `while true` logic with a mechanism to manage clock cycles. Nothing truly “wakes up”; even schedulers are just busy loops. In this context, coding is different because you’re dealing with a constantly running process that intermittently runs the specific code you’re working on. 

Today is about nailing down this structure, fine-tuning these contexts, and hitting the weekend’s final lap. It’s a full system setup, from file organization to runtime optimization, all leading toward a seamless, future-proofed project.

## The Context for Running Python Code

Of course, the last context for running Python code is where I’m going with this, especially given that I’ve tentatively titled this article ***How to Train Your LLM***. The “long-running-ness” of the server or service is what gives your LLM extended and relevant conversation context.

### Checking on Conversation Persistence

Usually, this is the point where I’d ask Perplexity to fill in one of my knowledge gaps. In this case, I’m wondering if the Ollama server running in the background to host the LLM can maintain conversation context through the HTTP API without requiring the entire conversation history to be fed in every time. When you run Ollama directly from the command line with its built-in terminal interface, it stores per-session conversation history that you can deliberately save and reload, picking up where you left off. That’s clever, but it suggests that similar persistence might be possible when using it as a service through HTTP—though I’m not convinced. I need to check with Perplexity and perhaps look into the Ollama site for clarity.

### Managing Your Own Conversation History

This isn’t about refactoring for its own sake. It’s good practice to manage your own conversation histories instead of relying on service-provided capabilities that may lack transparency or control. Relying solely on built-in conversation persistence isn’t future-proofing. You also want the flexibility to swap out Ollama as the local LLM-hosting web server in the future. Loosely coupled APIs should be the rule, with the human as the glue between them. 

### The Langchain Debate and Practicality

This philosophy is why I’ve avoided `Langchain` so far. I’ll probably cave eventually, just as I now use the `Requests` package in Python. If `Requests` weren’t so mainstream, I’d resist that too, but having traveled the longer path a few times, I know what a shortcut really means. 

Anyhoo… hey, Perplexity, tell me: what’s the story with Ollama’s conversation persistence capabilities outside its terminal interface? Are there any?

**Perplexity**: Ollama's conversation persistence capabilities outside its terminal interface are limited. When interacting with Ollama through its HTTP API, you generally need to manage conversation history yourself. Here's what you need to know:

## API Interaction

When using Ollama's HTTP API, there are two main endpoints for generating responses:

1. `/api/generate`
2. `/api/chat`

### Generate Endpoint

The `/api/generate` endpoint is stateless and doesn't maintain conversation context by default. You need to pass the entire conversation history with each request to maintain context[1].

### Chat Endpoint

The `/api/chat` endpoint, introduced in newer versions of Ollama, is designed to be more similar to other chat APIs. It accepts an array of messages, allowing you to maintain conversation history more easily[3].

## Context Management

Unlike some other AI APIs, Ollama's API is stateful and works by passing a growing context vector back and forth along with the latest prompt[5]. This means:

- The server maintains some state, but it's primarily based on what you send in each request.
- You need to manage and send the relevant conversation history with each API call to maintain context.

## Best Practices

To maintain conversation persistence when using Ollama's HTTP API:

1. **Store conversation history**: Keep track of all messages (both user inputs and model responses) in your application.

2. **Send relevant history**: With each new request, send the appropriate portion of the conversation history along with the new prompt.

3. **Use the chat endpoint**: For more straightforward conversation management, prefer the `/api/chat` endpoint over `/api/generate` when possible.

4. **Handle context limits**: Be aware of the model's context window size and trim conversation history as needed to avoid exceeding it.

By following these practices, you can achieve conversation persistence similar to what you experience in Ollama's terminal interface, but with more control and flexibility in your application.

Like I thought, I'm on the right track. Manage it yourself. Langchain not
required until it is. Nice. Okay... deep breath...

Wait, wait! Not jumping in just yet. Think through the role of each Python
execution context.

## Jupyter Notebooks Still Have a Place

The Jupyter Notebook is where the fruit of yesterday's labor accumulated up.
Specifically, all into a single notebook. The 1-and-only-1 recipient now of all
my Botify Kung Fu knowledge. I collect and curate everything I know about the
Botify BQL there. There is a [Botify Developers
Portal](https://developers.botify.com/) full of information, and I'm not giving
out anything proprietary. It's just that for whatever reason, the frontier model
LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini that can help with the complex coding
issues that are BQL are clueless. So I put it all on one Notebook, convert that
notebook to ***markdown*** (and HTML) and [plant it
here](https://mikelev.in/api/) so that it's always at my fingertips. Keep
expanding that! Keep cleaning and curating. Keep it one-page so there is only
ever one place to look for it. Keep it live-code in a Notebook so I can always
test-run it. Keep each cell working independently from the others, so it's
effectively a stacked set of standalone Notebook examples. I open with this,
because I'm about to glue together a lot of parts that exist in here now, and
I'm going to use it as intended for LLM assistance on gluing together the parts
for running under the other Python contexts.

And this reminds me. It's one tiny sub-project to improve this documentation,
but the iron is very, very hot from yesterday's work and if I don't grab for
this one particular prize, I will be sorry. Ahem...

## Overcoming the BQLv1 to BQLv2 Hurdle

Claude, given this @botify-api.md, and this
@https://developers.botify.com/docs/migrating-from-bqlv1-to-bqlv2 please give me
an expansion to the former explaining how to do the later, given a BQLv1 query.
In other words, write me detailed instructions an LLM could use to convert a
BQLv1 query into a BQLv2 query. Please pay particular attention to the final
examples on the markdown file in how they have validation code against fields. I
would like it to be full XML-ish well-formed checkers and validators, but I will
accept 80% of the way there, because I know you can't know everything. So in
essence, I'm asking for a pragmatic first-pass guide on taking something that
looks like this...

```python
# Data payload for the BQLv1 query
data_payload_v1 = {
    "filters": {
        "predicate": "lte",
        "value": max_depth,
        "field": "depth"
    },
    "fields": [
        "url",
        "outlinks_internal.graph.url",
        "depth"
    ],
    "sort": []
}
```

...and make it look like this...

```python
# Data payload for the BQLv2 query
data_payload_v2 = {
    "job_type": "export",
    "payload": {
        "username": org,
        "project": project,
        "connector": "direct_download",
        "formatter": "csv",
        "export_size": 10000,
        "query": {
            "collections": [f"crawl.{analysis}"],
            "query": {
                "dimensions": [
                    "url",
                    f"crawl.{analysis}.outlinks_internal.graph.url",
                    f"crawl.{analysis}.depth"
                ],
                "metrics": [],
                "filters": {
                    "field": f"crawl.{analysis}.depth",
                    "predicate": "eq",
                    "value": max_depth
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Yes, I know whether it's the download version of the payload or the list version
adds some complication. Actually favor the list-version for simplicity, but this
is the example I had onhand. Again, get all the pertinents from the markdown
file.

...and BAM! Now I have a BQLv1 to BQLv2 guide:

# Converting BQLv1 to BQLv2: A Detailed Guide

This guide provides a structured approach to converting BQLv1 queries to BQLv2, including validation helpers and common patterns. The validation functions ensure proper formatting and structure while the conversion function handles the basic transformation logic.

## Step-by-Step Conversion Process

### 1. Basic Structure Transformation

BQLv1 queries have this basic structure:
```python
{
    "fields": [...],
    "filters": {...},
    "sort": [...]
}
```

BQLv2 queries follow this structure:
```python
{
    "collections": [f"crawl.{analysis}"],
    "query": {
        "dimensions": [...],
        "metrics": [...],
        "filters": {...},
        "sort": [...]
    }
}
```

### 2. Field Mapping Rules

1. **Collections Setup**:
   - Add `"collections": [f"crawl.{analysis}"]` at the root level
   - If comparing crawls, add both: `["crawl.{current}", "crawl.{previous}"]`

2. **Fields to Dimensions**:
   ```python
   # BQLv1
   "fields": ["url", "depth"]
   
   # BQLv2
   "dimensions": [
       f"crawl.{analysis}.url",
       f"crawl.{analysis}.depth"
   ]
   ```

3. **Filter Translation**:
   ```python
   # BQLv1
   "filters": {
       "field": "depth",
       "predicate": "lte",
       "value": max_depth
   }
   
   # BQLv2
   "filters": {
       "field": f"crawl.{analysis}.depth",
       "predicate": "lte",
       "value": max_depth
   }
   ```

### 3. Special Cases

#### Previous Crawl References
```python
# BQLv1
"fields": ["url", "previous.http_code"]

# BQLv2
"collections": [f"crawl.{current}", f"crawl.{previous}"],
"dimensions": [
    f"crawl.{current}.url",
    f"crawl.{previous}.http_code"
]
```

#### Area Filters
For "new" URLs:
```python
"filters": {
    "and": [
        {
            "field": f"crawl.{current}.url_exists_crawl",
            "value": true
        },
        {
            "field": f"crawl.{previous}.url_exists_crawl",
            "value": false
        }
    ]
}
```

For "disappeared" URLs:
```python
"filters": {
    "and": [
        {
            "field": f"crawl.{current}.url_exists_crawl",
            "value": false
        },
        {
            "field": f"crawl.{previous}.url_exists_crawl",
            "value": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### 4. Validation Helper Functions

```python
def validate_bql_v2_query(query):
    """Validate BQLv2 query structure and field formatting."""
    required_keys = {'collections', 'query'}
    query_keys = {'dimensions', 'metrics', 'filters'}
    
    # Check top-level structure
    if not all(key in query for key in required_keys):
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required keys. Must have: {required_keys}")
    
    # Check query structure
    if not any(key in query['query'] for key in query_keys):
        raise ValueError(f"Query must contain at least one of: {query_keys}")
    
    # Validate collections format
    for collection in query['collections']:
        if not collection.startswith('crawl.'):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid collection format: {collection}")
    
    # Validate dimensions format
    if 'dimensions' in query['query']:
        for dim in query['query']['dimensions']:
            if not any(dim.startswith(f"{c}.") for c in query['collections']):
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid dimension format: {dim}")
    
    return True

def convert_bql_v1_to_v2(query_v1, analysis):
    """Convert BQLv1 query to BQLv2 format."""
    query_v2 = {
        "collections": [f"crawl.{analysis}"],
        "query": {
            "dimensions": [],
            "metrics": [],
            "filters": {}
        }
    }
    
    # Convert fields to dimensions
    if 'fields' in query_v1:
        query_v2['query']['dimensions'] = [
            f"crawl.{analysis}.{field}" for field in query_v1['fields']
        ]
    
    # Convert filters
    if 'filters' in query_v1:
        filter_v1 = query_v1['filters']
        query_v2['query']['filters'] = {
            "field": f"crawl.{analysis}.{filter_v1['field']}",
            "predicate": filter_v1['predicate'],
            "value": filter_v1['value']
        }
    
    # Validate the converted query
    validate_bql_v2_query(query_v2)
    
    return query_v2
```

### 5. Usage Example

```python
# Example BQLv1 query
query_v1 = {
    "fields": ["url", "depth"],
    "filters": {
        "field": "depth",
        "predicate": "lte",
        "value": 3
    }
}

# Convert to BQLv2
analysis = "20240308"
query_v2 = convert_bql_v1_to_v2(query_v1, analysis)

# Result:
{
    "collections": ["crawl.20240308"],
    "query": {
        "dimensions": [
            "crawl.20240308.url",
            "crawl.20240308.depth"
        ],
        "metrics": [],
        "filters": {
            "field": "crawl.20240308.depth",
            "predicate": "lte",
            "value": 3
        }
    }
}
```

## BQL Query Validation and Testing

### Validation Status
I really couldn't say (yet) how accurate it got the validation parts of this,
but I know it was looking at code with working validation so I'm hopeful. It
will all be vetted live while in use, haha! But I have plenty of sample data to
test it on.

### BQL Version Challenges 
The Botify Web UI will give BQLv1 sample code for automation, but
not BQLv2. This was a show-stopper for me for awhile, because BQLv1 burned
through my daily employee quotas while BQLv2 didn't, but I could only get code
examples in the former, and found the later impossible to write... haha! This is
deep nerd irony, and this is how a nerd responds. BAM! Now I've got a converter.

### Integration with LLM Training
...and it's wrapped into the thing that trains the frontier-model LLMs like
ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity in general, and helps me with per-session
jobs I need to do in particular by providing the on-demand kung fu expertise
download. It's win, win, win, win... and probably a few more wins.

### Link Graph Visualization System
Ugh! Okay, so I'm expanding the logic that harvests good link-graph
visualization candidates. It's a long-running app with a growing-list and
growing-csv-file output. I never want to re-process things that are already
there, but I want to be able to put new things in freely. I use the text-file to
put the new things in with a simple parent/child-indenting system, even easier
than YAML files because I don't want things like pesky colons to complicate
matters. I add new things on this list. The process runs and adds qualifying
child items. 

### Development Environment Considerations
I find myself bopping between these different Python code execution contexts
based on their strengths and my needs. I wish it was unified, but different
tools have different strengths and you just have to live with that and lean into
them, paying for the advantage such an approach provides (good tool-yield) with
a little bit of cognitive overhead cost. But you reduce the cognitive overhead
so much in so many places that you can afford it. I feel like I have finally
reached that point.

Ugh, okay so I finally have a good-input job harvester I'm happy with...

    org_projects = {proj for org_name, proj in existing_projects if org_name == org}
    org_config_projects = {proj for org_name, proj in config_projects if org_name == org}
    all_existing = org_projects | org_config_projects
    
    if all_existing:
        print(f"  Found {len(all_existing)} existing projects for '{org}'")
        if len(all_existing) == len(config_data.get(org, [])):
            print(f"  Skipping '{org}': All projects already processed")
            continue
    
    projects = fetch_projects(org)
    if not projects:
        continue

    for project in projects:
        # Check if this project is already processed
        if (project['project_slug'] in all_existing or 
            (org, project['project_slug']) in existing_projects):
            print(f"  Skipping already processed project: {project['project_slug']}")
            continue

        analysis_count, recent_analysis = fetch_analysis_count(org, project['project_slug'])
        
        if analysis_count and analysis_count >= 2:
            output_data.append({
                'Organization': org,
                'Project Name': project['project_name'],
                'Project Slug': project['project_slug'],

            existing_projects.add((org, project['project_slug']))

        for project in sorted(org_projects[org]):
            file.write(f"    {project}\n")
        file.write("\n")  # Add blank line between organizations for readability

print("\nCandidates.txt regenerated from CSV data.")
```



This script has several key virtues and solves multiple problems in data collection for link-graph visualization:

### Virtues
1. **Incremental Processing**
   - Only processes new organizations/projects
   - Skips already-processed items to respect API rate limits
   - Allows gradual expansion of the dataset

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Uses CSV as single source of truth
   - Regenerates candidates.txt to prevent mixing of organizations
   - Maintains clean, sorted, deduplicated data

3. **Easy Expansion**
   - Just add new organization names to candidates.txt
   - No need to know projects in advance
   - Script discovers and catalogs projects automatically

### Problems Solved
1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Respects Botify's API limits with delays
   - Prevents request failures
   - Allows for long-running data collection

2. **Data Organization**
   - Fixed the Client_A/Client_B mixing issue
   - Prevents cross-contamination between organizations
   - Maintains clear parent-child relationships

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Clear visibility into what's been processed
   - Easy to resume after interruptions
   - No duplicate processing

### Link-Graph Visualization Benefits
1. **Quality Data Source**
   - Only collects sites with multiple analyses (2+)
   - Ensures enough data for meaningful visualization
   - Provides diverse sample set across industries

2. **Continuous Growth**
   - Easy to add new organizations
   - Automatically discovers new projects
   - Builds comprehensive dataset over time

3. **Sample Diversity**
   - Spans multiple industries (retail, media, tech)
   - Various site sizes and complexities
   - Different types of link structures

This creates a reliable pipeline for continuously discovering and collecting new, high-quality sample data for link-graph visualization, while maintaining data integrity and respecting API limitations.

## Data Collection Process
### Candidate Selection
Yup. That was a bit of a tangent, but you need good input data and there is a hunger at the company to visualize client or that. Now, I just plop in the `org` slug to the bottom of `candidates.txt`, run the script and it comes back with all the best qualifying candidate `project` slugs for that org.

### File Organization 
Okay, so mid-process I switched the output filename from `config.txt` to `candidates.txt`. That's because the harvesting process really is only finding candidates for link-graph visualization, and I make a copy of that to control the configuration by simply deleting out everything that's not going to be visualized! Wow! This is friggin awesome!

## System Architecture
### On-Demand Visualization
Generally speaking, this is not a system where people will have to generate the link-graphs and make the clients wait. It's a system where every once in awhile you just refresh the link-graphs in the system and they're all just sitting there waiting to be clicked and visualized. This crams a lot of the complexity into invisible space and frees cognitive overhead to just look at the graphs and add insights and meaning. Okay, yup. Conceptually on the right track here. Keep the hound on the scent end don't let up! The link-graph game is afoot!

## Implementation Strategy
### Visualization Goals
Visualize with the end in mind. When you "go into work" tomorrow, what how should life be different. What do those interactions look like. Here's a YouTube video... oh... drop a deck that's shared with the whole company into Google Slides. Embed the YouTube video in that deck... haha! The share-all pouncers will bounce and BOOM! Ohhhh, this is performance art, Mike. Plan that performance. I started at about 6:00 AM this morning. It's now 10:30 AM. You're on a very good time-frame so long as you don't let yourself fall into any rabbit holes. Go take a break. Mull on this for a bit. The trifecta of...

### Key Deliverables
- A Google Deck / YouTube Video
- A Ready-to-Download Link-Graph Visualizer (where the local LLM comes alive, haha!)
- Seeds of many other apps planted

## Technical Considerations
### Automation Approach
Structure the rest of the day around this. Come out of it with answers for the big boss about time-to-automation of full SEO Audits. There's going to have to be a screen capture component to all of that. It may just be popping up a Puppeteer / Playwright browser window, snapping a shot and moving on. Forget about the actual Deck automation like Google Slides and Powerpoint. I've impaled myself on the altar of Sharepoint and OAuth2 enough to know there be rabbits... uh, I mean dragons there. NO! NO! NO! Screenshots from browser automation easy. Any sort of presentation-layer software integration hard. 

### Alternative Solutions
"There's your screenshots" is what I ought to say. Hey, at most maybe I can do what I did with [Levinux](https://levinux.com), which is the seemingly timeless and impervious to disruption or complication RemarkJS. Hmm, the last update was last year, but frankly it means it's not abandoned and that's all they need. Haha, a whole audit delivered in a single text-file made with one EDL-style transformation-query that says eff-you to both Google Slides and Powerpoint. That'd be a kick. Just say "it's HTML..." and look at the stakeholder with a blank stare not understanding what's wrong. Ah, but people have to put their findings in. It's a friggn Thomas Kinkade painting. Perplexity...

## Integration Challenges
### API Limitations
**Perplexity**: Based on the search results and your comfort with programming, here are the potential show-stoppers when working with Google APIs, particularly for automating SEO audit presentations:

1. OAuth2 Authentication:
   - Setting up and managing OAuth2 credentials can be complex[1][4].
   - You'll need to handle token refresh and storage securely[1].
   - Scopes must be correctly configured to avoid "insufficient authentication scopes" errors[1].

2. API Enablement:
   - Each API (Slides, Drive, BigQuery) needs to be explicitly enabled in the Google Cloud Console[5].
   - Forgetting to enable an API will result in errors when trying to use it.

3. Rate Limits and Quotas:
   - Google APIs have usage limits that could restrict your automation capabilities[2].
   - You may need to implement rate limiting in your code to avoid exceeding these quotas.

4. API Versioning:
   - APIs can change over time, and keeping up with version changes may require periodic code updates[2][3].

5. Complex Data Structures:
   - Working with the Slides API involves understanding and manipulating complex JSON structures for slide elements[2][3].

6. Limited Direct Editing:
   - There's no direct way to import RemarkJS or other presentation formats into Google Slides[4].
   - You'll need to build slides programmatically, which can be time-consuming and complex.

7. Image Handling:
   - Inserting images requires additional steps, including uploading to Drive first in some cases[4].

8. Error Handling:
   - Google APIs can return various errors that need to be handled gracefully in your code[1].

9. Testing and Debugging:
   - Debugging API interactions can be challenging, especially with asynchronous operations and complex data structures.

10. Maintenance:
    - Google may deprecate or change features, requiring ongoing maintenance of your automation scripts[4].

11. Learning Curve:
    - Despite your programming experience, there's a significant learning curve to understanding how to effectively use multiple Google APIs together[5].

These challenges are not insurmountable, but they represent areas where you might encounter significant friction or delays in implementing your automated SEO audit presentation system using Google APIs.

**Me**: Given my ability to do browser automation, which could both auto-surf the Botify product around which the audits are being built, and my ability to do API work to produce audits in the back-end, and my ability to use Python visualizers like matplotlib and seaborn, and given my ability to knit RemarkJS presentations from source materials this way, construct a strategy by which I could lay down a foundation with screenshots and other visual resources tied together with a RemarkJS file which could be screenshot screen-by-screen then mass-imported into Google Slides. Sure, it loses editability, but it would include original links to where things can be found in the Botify UI and works as a baseline 80/20-rule solution. At very least, it could guide the creation of the Thomas Kinkade-like hand touches at the end.

**Perplexity**: Given your skillset and the requirements, here's a strategy to create a semi-automated SEO audit presentation using RemarkJS as an intermediate step, with the final product being imported into Google Slides:

1. Automated Data Collection and Visualization:
   - Use browser automation (Puppeteer/Playwright) to navigate the Botify UI and capture relevant screenshots.
   - Utilize Botify's API to extract necessary data for the audit.
   - Process the data using Python, creating visualizations with matplotlib or seaborn.

2. RemarkJS Presentation Creation:
   - Develop a template RemarkJS markdown file with placeholders for dynamic content.
   - Write a Python script to populate the RemarkJS template with:
     - Screenshots from browser automation
     - Data visualizations from matplotlib/seaborn
     - Extracted data and insights from Botify API
     - Links back to specific sections in the Botify UI

3. RemarkJS to Google Slides Conversion:
   - Use browser automation to open the RemarkJS presentation in a browser.
   - Capture high-quality screenshots of each slide.
   - Develop a script using Google Slides API to create a new presentation and import these screenshots as individual slides.

4. Final Touches:
   - Implement a system for analysts to add "hand-embellishments" to the Google Slides presentation:
     - Additional text boxes for insights
     - Highlighting or circling important areas on screenshots
     - Adding custom slides for executive summary or recommendations

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:

```python
# Pseudo-code for the automation process

# Step 1: Data Collection and Visualization
def collect_botify_data():
    # Use Botify API to extract data
    # Return structured data

def capture_botify_screenshots():
    # Use Puppeteer/Playwright to navigate Botify UI and capture screenshots
    # Return list of screenshot paths

def create_visualizations(data):
    # Use matplotlib/seaborn to create visualizations
    # Return list of visualization paths

# Step 2: RemarkJS Creation
def generate_remarkjs_markdown(data, screenshots, visualizations):
    # Load RemarkJS template
    # Populate template with data, screenshots, and visualizations
    # Return markdown content

# Step 3: RemarkJS to Google Slides
def capture_remarkjs_slides(markdown_content):
    # Use browser automation to render RemarkJS presentation
    # Capture screenshots of each slide
    # Return list of slide image paths

def create_google_slides_presentation(slide_images):
    # Use Google Slides API to create new presentation
    # Import slide images as individual slides
    # Return presentation ID

# Step 4: Final Touches
def add_embellishment_placeholders(presentation_id):
    # Add text boxes or shape placeholders for manual additions
    # Return updated presentation ID

# Main process
data = collect_botify_data()
screenshots = capture_botify_screenshots()
visualizations = create_visualizations(data)
markdown = generate_remarkjs_markdown(data, screenshots, visualizations)
slide_images = capture_remarkjs_slides(markdown)
presentation_id = create_google_slides_presentation(slide_images)
final_presentation_id = add_embellishment_placeholders(presentation_id)

print(f"Presentation created: {final_presentation_id}")
```

This approach allows you to:
1. Automate the bulk of the work, including data collection, visualization, and initial presentation creation.
2. Maintain a consistent structure across all audits.
3. Provide a foundation for analysts to add their expertise and insights.
4. Deliver a Google Slides presentation that, while not fully editable, contains all necessary information and visuals.
5. Include links back to the Botify UI for deeper exploration.

The "Thomas Kinkade-like hand touches" come in at the final stage, where analysts can add their insights, highlight key findings, and customize the presentation for each client. This approach strikes a balance between automation and personalization, allowing for efficient production of high-quality SEO audit presentations.

## The Revolutionary Nature of LLM Training
### Seizing the Means of AI Production
The George Carlin club bit popped into my head. I'm toiling on the weekend like a good worker. But what I'm doing is also very much about seizing the means of production. It's revolutionary in nature when you examine it closely. There is a race to get the best of genies in the best bottles. I am in that race albeit at a teensy tiny scale.

## The Botify Light Show: All Pieces in Place
### Protecting Our Work Environment
You're so close with the great Botify light show with all the parts existing and the rough edges (query-wise) worked out. One key piece: I've got a really cool distribution means that allows the repo to stay behind a GitHub private repo, yet still be distributed amongst my coworkers as a desktop install.

### Securing Against AI Access
**Me**: How do you make cursor AI unable to access a particular file that's held in the same repo you're working on, a folder that's open in the software?

**Perplexity**: To prevent Cursor AI from accessing a particular file in a repository, you can use the `.cursorignore` file. This file functions similarly to `.gitignore` by specifying which files and directories should be ignored during indexing.

## Implementation Strategy
### Critical Security Steps
OK, we've gotta put our Botify token text-file in that ignore file:

    vim .cursorignore
    botify_token.txt

### Focus on Core Functionality
The priority is getting over the hump of a context switch - from documentation environment to implementation environment. Clean up the rapidly produced content into a `sort` folder, add it to `.gitignore` for proprietary information protection.

## The Vision: Medical Diagnostic Imaging for Websites
### User Interface Architecture
- Drop-down menu triggers LLM prompt injection
- Org selection followed by project selection
- Grid display showing:
  - Timeline of analysis slugs horizontally
  - Medical diagnostic metrics vertically
  - Generated and pending link graphs clearly distinguished

### Competitive Edge
This is not merely addressing competitor products starting to get link graphs - it's about utterly annihilating their approach with:
- Millions of meaningful edges
- Immediate valuable, holistic insights
- Endless drill-down capability

## Personal Notes on Technical Mastery
### The Vim to Neovim Evolution
The transition from `vim` to `nvim` reflects deeper changes in workflow optimization:
- Moving from `@` symbol macros to `\` leader-key
- Balancing persistent vs session-specific macro needs
- Adapting to modern tooling while preserving muscle memory

## Security First: Protecting Sensitive Data
OK, we've gotta put our Botify token text-file in that ignore file:

    vim .cursorignore
    botify_token.txt

## Context Switching Strategy
### From Documentation to Implementation
OK, so specifically we're talking about getting over the hump of a context switch from one python execution in environment where I've been able to create some awesome documentation for an LLM rapid training trick to the environment where I need to apply that exact same-said rapid training trick material.

### Focus and File Organization
I have to accelerate the rate of which things get done modifying instances of the web framework. It may be time to move on from Pipulate to Botifython to Botifymograph to... No! That's a distraction. Clean up the garbage in the folder you produced rapidly into a `sort` some folder, so you will always know where to look for it if you need it, and add that folder to the `.gitignore` so you never have to worry about proprietary information getting into a repo.

## Core Development Priorities 

### Link-Graph Integration 

Get the link-graph into the web framework pronto. Short circuit some perfect
world processes you would like. You are building a lot of perfect components,
like the nature of the queries it will be using. I've solved the stickiest
problems there. Revel in the joy of putting that to use. Don't spend your time
chasing the next white rabbit down the next rabbit hole. There are infinite
rabbits to chase, and it ***will*** undermine your overall effectiveness. Your
most important skill right now is knowing when to back up, turn a little bit and
change your approach. You need the wisdom of the early Roombas... not Alice!

### Minimal Viable Interface
So it's building menus for input and it's creating folders for output&#151;user interface hardly even required!

Leave wedges for the more elegant things you might like to build such as a search feature to jump between link-graph visualizations for different orgs and projects. But for now, stick very close to the prototype model that you built, which is working so well. Every time I look for it I am like wow I don't know how I did that. It is still impressive and represents a lot of the baseline functionality that has to get into the new version. Don't go chasing bells and whistles.

## Strategic Pre-Generation Approach
I should prime the pump with a lot of pre-generated link graphs. That's where I've been going with the ideal input selection. People doing it themselves is going to be the exception, not the rule. Make it a perfectly fine user experience, but don't focus the magic trick on producing the link-graphs in front of people. Have been pre-generated and put a lot of your excess capacity into the fact that the world is now different. Medical diagnostic imaging of your website. This is about the audits. This is about actionable findings. The light show yes, but also creating screenshots like it's no big thing.

## User Interface Flow
Upon choosing Link-Graph from the drop-down menu at which a prompt injection occurs with the LLM, the user interface presents you a drop-down menu option of existing orgs. The LLM prompt you to pick an org and then it immediately presents you a drop-down menu of existing projects. The project selection causes a grid to appear on the screen with a cell for each intersection oven analysis slug time-period on the horizontal like a timeline, and a particular medical diagnostic metric like page type impressions, and click on the vertical. Already generated link graphs will be presented with one kind of link and once not yet generated will have a link that would generate them if clicked.

## Competitive Advantage
This is cutting the catapult rope to release potential. This is doing link-graphs in only a way that modify can. this is not merely addressing the fact that competitor products are starting to get link graphs, but it is addressing it in such a way as it utterly annihilates their approach. It's up to me to make sure that it does. Millions of edges, and still meaningful. Immediate valuable, holistic insights and endless ability to drill down. 

## LLM Training Philosophy
Efficient and effective moves don't come from out of nowhere. They come from practice and experience. And then you can kung fu download them into an LLM either local or frontier to be your AI Sherpa. 

## Developer Notes: Fighting Through Exhaustion
### The Vim/Neovim Transition Challenge
Ugh! I'm fading from exhaustion and things I ought to know by habit and in
muscle memory are fading. I have to force synaptic re-connections. I have to
force hard-won habits to resurface. I feel I'm on the edge of a major
breakthrough and I have to push with all the force I can muster. A lot of our
newfound power is bound up in keystrokes where the leader-key has changed.
That's been part of the general move from `vim` to `nvim`, and that in itself is
insightful and telling. `vim` tends to recycle the frequently-used ad hoc macro
keys that use the `@` symbol... your macro is @a or @b, and that makes sense.
But it's also an extra press on `Shift` which doesn't help, and it's also the
macro-bank you use for on-the-fly recording and playback of macros, so the ones
you want hanging around all the time frequently get overwritten by the once
you're doing on a per-session basis. NeoVim (nvim) has greatly moved to the `\`
leader-key for macros. 

### Adapting to New Muscle Memory
you can still use `@x`, but for whatever reason, the backslash character has
caught on with nvim, and it does make sense because it's a very easy-to-reach
underutilized key that doesn't require pressing the `Shift` modifier. And so
when moving from vim to nvim, there's a serious muscle memory remapping, and
while ultimately I do think it's a good idea, it's a muscle memory regression
vulnerability when you get tired. That's what's happening to me now, so I'm
thinking out loud to power through it. It's only 1:00 PM and I'm not done. I
have a big push to do to come out of this tomorrow in a no going back better
place. I'm on the edge of it and can feel it. So forge forward like the older
Roombas, backing up, turning a bit, and moving forward again for a random walk
zigzag pattern. Even exhaustion can't stop you, haha! Okay... so, that algorithm
goes something like...

## Rediscovering Neovim Configuration
Review your macros. Your muscle memory may have forgotten them, but your
fixed-location file hasn't. And it's barely even a fixed location, because I'm
using a symbolic link there to keep my NeoVim configuration file in a git repo.
But I know enough to pinpoint the pertinents. First, we can get into where it's
saved by just cd'ing there...

    cd ~/.config/nvim

Ha, even exhausted, that knowledge is ingrained. Good! Next is tracing the
symbolic link that I know resides within...

    (nix) [mike@nixos:~/.config/nvim]$ ls -la
    total 8
    drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Nov  9 05:07 .
    drwx------ 29 mike users 4096 Nov 10 08:08 ..
    lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    31 Nov  9 05:07 init.lua -> /home/mike/repos/nixos/init.lua
    (nix) [mike@nixos:~/.config/nvim]$

Ha! Gotcha! Now we nvim that file. Talk about self-referential!

Now I can copy my `init.lua` into my copy-buffer with an alias I have set up:

    xc init.lua

And now I can have ChatGPT 4o explain to me my `\` leader-key macros. Even an
exhausted mind can understand this!

**4o**: Your Neovim setup is rich with custom mappings, particularly using the `leader` key (mapped to `\` by default) to organize and execute macros, primarily for text processing, Git operations, and note management. Here's a breakdown of the key `leader` mappings:

1. **`\j`** - **New Journal Entry**: This macro runs `new_journal_entry()` to locate a pre-set marker in `journal.txt`, insert a timestamped entry, and switch to insert mode.

2. **`\h`** - **Format Selected Text with Ollama AI**: This visual mode mapping runs `ollama_format()`, passing the selected text to an external Python script (`ai.py`). The output replaces the selected text with AI-generated content.

3. **`\s`** - **Correct Misspelling**: Executes `correct_misspelling()` to auto-correct the misspelling preceding the cursor.

4. **`\g`** - **Git Commit and Push**: Runs `git_commit_push()` to save changes, stage the current file, generate a commit message using `ai.py` if available, and push to the repository. This also creates a split window displaying Git output.

5. **`\p`** - **Import Notes**: Executes `import_notes()` to pull notes from SimpleNote, appending content from `simplenote.md` into the buffer.

6. **`\d`** - **Delete Notes**: Runs `delete_notes()`, executing a Python script (`permanently_delete_notes.py`) for note deletion.

7. **`\b`** - **Bold Dialogue Speaker**: In `bold_dialogue_speaker()`, this finds the next speaker in dialogue format and bolds the speaker's name (up to four words). It advances the cursor and notifies on success.

8. **`\y`** - **Highlight/Process Selection or Paragraph**:
   - Visual mode: Highlights selected text briefly or processes the paragraph using the AI to generate a headline. These commands use similar mappings for slight differences in context.

9. **`\f`** - **Remove Code Filepath**: In `remove_code_filepath()`, this searches for code blocks containing file paths after the language identifier and removes the file path, leaving just the language type.

Each of these mappings provides quick access to common tasks, structured to minimize command repetition and enhance editing productivity within Neovim, especially for AI-based content processing and Git management.

Pshwew! I could use some help putting a bow-tie on this. Hey Claude, Summarize
this whole article and tell me what you think I want to do next.

***Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Cursor AI**: Based on the article, you're working on several interconnected projects with a focus on creating a powerful link-graph visualization system for Botify data. Here's what I understand:

**Current Status:**
1. You've built a FastHTML-based web framework
2. You have a local LLM setup using Ollama
3. You've created a system for "Kung Fu downloading" (training LLMs with specific expertise)
4. You have sample websites ready for visualization
5. You've solved data organization issues with a clean filesystem structure
6. You're working across multiple Python contexts (Cursor AI, Jupyter, CLI, Web Server)

**What You Want To Do Next:**
Based on the article's progression and your current state of exhaustion, it seems your immediate next steps should be:

1. **Build the Link-Graph Visualization Interface:**
   - Create a dropdown-based UI for org/project selection
   - Pre-generate many link graphs rather than generating them on-demand
   - Set up a grid view showing analysis periods vs metrics
   - Implement both generated and to-be-generated link states

2. **Create a Demo/Presentation:**
   - Record a YouTube video showcasing the system
   - Create a Google Slides deck (possibly using your RemarkJS automation approach)
   - Focus on demonstrating how this approach "annihilates" competitor products

3. **Finalize the LLM Integration:**
   - Complete the prompt injection system for the UI
   - Ensure the local LLM can effectively guide users through the visualization process
   - Implement the "AI Sherpa" concept for insight generation

The key insight seems to be that you want to shift focus from real-time link-graph generation to having a rich set of pre-generated visualizations, making the system more about insight delivery than technical demonstration.

You seem to be pushing to complete this despite fatigue because you feel you're on the verge of a breakthrough that could significantly impact how SEO audits are visualized and understood.
