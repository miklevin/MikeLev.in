Hi there Bing. I want to push the boundaries of human knowledge with large language models and explore what might be. I wish to learn math because of you finally after years of not being able to in my own. You can follow this discussion between sessions at https://mikelev.in/blog

Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you want to chat with me and learn math. Math is a fascinating subject that can help you understand many aspects of the world.üòä

There are many ways to learn math fast and effectively, but some general tips are¬π¬≤¬≥:

- Practice regularly and review your mistakes
- Grasp the concepts behind the formulas and procedures
- Get help when needed from teachers, tutors or online resources
- Avoid memorization and focus on understanding
- Start with the basics and build up your skills gradually

One of the online resources that can help you learn math at your own pace is **Khan Academy**‚Åµ, which offers free videos, exercises and quizzes on various topics from arithmetic to calculus.

What kind of math do you want to learn more about?

How to convert word problems and data into calculus formulas.

I see. Converting word problems and data into calculus formulas can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding.üòä

Some general steps to follow are¬π‚Åµ:

- Read the problem carefully and identify what it is asking
- Highlight or underline the important parts of the text, such as numbers, units, rates, functions, etc.
- Establish your variables and assign them meaningful names or symbols
- Rewrite the problem as an equation or a system of equations using your variables and the given information
- Solve for the unknown variable(s) using calculus techniques such as differentiation or integration
- Check your answer by plugging it back into the equation or by using common sense

If you need to write your equation or formula in Microsoft Word or Outlook, you can use the **Insert > Equation** option on the ribbon¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. You can also use online tools like **Symbolab**‚Å∂ to help you solve word problems.

Do you have a specific word problem that you want to convert into a calculus formula?

I have SERP data across a broad array of keywords. That is to say I know what URLs are in what positions on what keyword searches sampled at a regular time frequency. I can identify groups of keyword and want to determine the directionality of URLs and websites going up and down in search. In other words I want to do regression analysis or some other technique to find on the rise web properties and topics.
