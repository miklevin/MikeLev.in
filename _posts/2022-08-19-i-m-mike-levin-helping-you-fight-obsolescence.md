I'm also creating videos to help others fight obsolescence in their technical skills. Come join me as I introduce people to Linux and vim, and show them how to install Linux on their Windows systems with wsl --install in Powershell. Today is the day to take control of your technical skills!

Woo wee! I got another video slammed out using a script that's been running
through my head. I think doing the overhaul of MikeLev.in using simplecss.org
has really got my creative juices flowing. It's a catalyst. I've got to keep
that momentum going now. Every main page of my site will have a video which
I'll probably write a script for.

Hi, I'm Mike Levin helping you fight obsolescence in your personal technical
skills by helping you see what tools to take up and why. Linux and vim are the
way to get started, and you can on your Windows system today simply by changing
your built-in default command-line from MS-DOS and Powershell to Linux by
opening a Powershell and typing wsl --install.
