## The Application of AI

This project is the application of artificial intelligence. While the need for
coding ostensibly goes away because machines can do that now, simultaneously the
demand for managing that exact same process goes up. Machines aren't going to
code for themselves unsupervised. They're coding for people to accomplish things
with various quality assurance processes tightly integrated &#151; and these
processes amount to a human having their hands firmly on the wheel steering that
process.

## The Auto-Driving Analogy 

We don't walk everywhere anymore, we drive and machines become an extension of
our bodies. Muscle memory teaches us how to drive naturally, but even so the
auto-driving tech is getting better and better until a cross-over will occur at
which point it will be safer to just let the machine drive. But the human still
needs to tell it where to go. Same thing, except that driving is not a creative
process like coding. So instead of auto-drivers, the coding assistants should be
thought of as a sort of magical paintbrush responding to your commands.

## The Challenge of Tool Interfaces

And the nuances of how you issue commands to a magic paintbrush (or a magic
typewriter if you prefer) is what this article discusses. That is the
application of artificial intelligence. We can't all be Nvidia and OpenAI making
the tools of AI, as appealing as that might be. But we can be expert users of
those very tools. 

## Future-proofing Our Tools

### The Challenge of Changing Interfaces

But that's where the future-proofing I talk about so much comes in. Cars work as
extensions of our bodies because the interface to a car, the way the dashboard
is laid out and the steering-wheel and pedals don't change that much from car to
car. It's easy to adapt when switching between cars.

### The Early Adopter's Dilemma 

But when tools are new and you're trying to get the strategic advantage out of
being an early adopter and using them well, there's a very good chance that your
hard-won muscle memory and new habits are going to be obsoleted over and over.
It's like how a steering wheel works on a car changing. Unimaginable, given the
danger and havoc it would cause; yet still, a very accurate comparison.

### Finding Stability in Change

We have a few rare fixed-position steering wheels in tech such as the LPvg
(Linux, Python, vim & git) stack, and thankfully some unification around the
OpenAI API amongst the tool-makers. The key is lovable and long-lived interfaces
that play into habit and muscle memory in a way that minimizes disruptive drift
even as the landscape changes around you. Generic tech!

## The Reality of Code Understanding

So what are the skills, habits and muscle memory of guiding the auto-coding of a
machine? Can we really get to those ***no-code*** abstractions that spares the
human from even really having to look at the programming code? Is there some
universal visual language we can intuitively use so that we don't have to
actually understand the innards? Nonsense! Someone's still going to need to
understand what they're looking at. And so these choices come down to choice of
language, and that choice has for the most part been made: Python.

## The Journey of AI-Assisted Code

Yesterday I changed code AIs helped write &#151; which still had some mysteries
in it &#151; into something that I felt truly belonged to me. Now it feels as if
I wrote it myself in the first place, and when I go in to add new features, it
is both easier for me to do things myself and I can prompt more clearly to the
AIs for additional help.

So I went from this sort of extremely ambitious "write this for me" optimism
into the "OMG that works" honeymoon, into the "oh, I need to understand this"
pie-in-the-face reality when it came time to grow and expand the code.

## The Importance of Context

And for that, I needed a deeper understanding. And a fleshing out of that deeper
understanding turns out to be writing articles exactly like this one about the
code, and using that as part of a sort of super-prompt to the AI, which gives it
all the context and gets it up to speed with you in a way that feels eerily
human. You're telling it stories. It's responding to those stories, with a
deeper understanding and improved quality output.

## The Evolution of AI

It turns out that the context of the thing is really important, and these
articles are exactly that sort of context, especially as the AIs advance from
just barely being able to code better than a human (today), to general
intelligence, to super-intelligent. We have this image of them staying these
cloud-based ChatGPT-like assistants as they undergo that transformation, but I
think that will be just one variety&#151; the LLM-type OpenAI made sure the
pubic was getting exposed to when they released ChatGPT. 

## Physical Embodiment and Experience

AGI and superintelligence are going to need robot bodies and lifetime context,
like a human has. I mean, it will be given this stuff in virtual worlds at
accelerated rates the way Jensen Huang talks about it with the [Nvidia Omniverse
in videos like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_DR1_zhmCU), so there's a
lot going on that's outside the realm of the average person to play a direct
role. Once the bots are physically based and don't need those cloud-connections,
they can start having subjective experiences because their sensors and actuators
are connected just like your senses are wired to your brain, along with your
arms, legs, hands and feet. 

## The Reality of AI Consciousness

Senses are sensors and appendages are actuators. The strange feedback loop
between them and processors creates what functionally is subjective experiences
in the processing, regardless of the semantic arguments that will exist about
what to label it. That's where quacks-like-a-duck sentience happens. Does it
matter if the soul is real if its transforming society around you? Functionally,
real is real. Ultimately, it's a case of practicality trumping philosophy. And
we're in the thick if it right now with the cloud versions of this stuff, whose
significance is already as profound as the hype makes out because even without
the super-context that super-intelligence is going to need (the source of Ilya
and Musk complaining about peak data?), the in-your-code context they have today
is quite a lot. It is functionally driving them forward.

## The Power of Context and Story

But it's static models underneath! How can they be functionally driven forward
and getting better? Aren't they topping out?

Well, that's where this project and this article series come into play. The LLMs
helped me yesterday better than ever, because the overarching story was clearer.
You hear folks like Jensen Huang talk about the art of prompting and prompt
engineering. He talks about how ChatGPT is his companion during the course of
the day, always open during the course of the day. Currently, there's a
disconnect between that daily constant exposure to a human which could fuel some
sort of persistence of thought we desire in our robot-buddies and what it
actually is &#151; reset every time.

## The Future of LLM Memory

But as these token-windows get larger and their supplementary database systems
that can index and make real-time searchable to the LLM (separate from
conversation history) for real-time prompt augmentation and availability during
chain-of-reasoning, LLMs are going to piece together bigger pictures&#151;
storytelling! If you're not explicitly story-telling to the LLM, it will be
storytelling to itself in the background to create that super-context and truly
understand what you mean in your requests. 

## Understanding Ambiguity and Context

What do I mean? You're not always being clear when you prompt an AI. It's called
ambiguity. Spoken language is riddled with imprecision. But we're trying to make
our LLMs give us precise truthful and accurate answers. So they have to resolve
that issue. Whatever you meant by your last ambiguous prompt you gave the LLM
likely needs more context to respond well to you. So to disambiguate it, it may
look to your entire interaction history with it. Token windows don't matter.

## The Role of User Identity

The AI's personal database of you likely exists if you have to log-in to use it.
We can all see the recent chat history in services like ChatGPT, Perplexity and
Gemini and Claude. This is why we have to log in to use them. Without
identifying you, there is no distinct knowledge of you. So login is essential
for a discrete log-like history. And with a discrete log-like history of your
chat discussions, the actual ability to query against it (not counting against
the conversation token window-size) is one quick database indexing away.

## The Technical Implementation

Your whole discussion history can be vector embedded and searchable in an
instant. No biggie. Yesterday's tech, in fact. To make your whole discussion
history a resource in the LLM's train-of-thought reasoning when dealing with you
is just scaling issues to make it economically feasible. But the vendors like
OpenAI have gotta make the user pay for that sort of server-side resource being
allocated or else the whole system would get bogged down. This is how we get
some feeling of that 1-on-1 context we expect from our robot buddies of the
future from our cloud infrastructure of today.

## Local LLM Considerations

With this local LLM project I'm doing here, I will soon have to choose a vector
database and embedding scheme to start doing the same thing. Since it's local
resources, I don't have the same cost and resource restrictions as cloud
architectures, so I can make the LLM have the discussion history back to first
interaction and last forever. I could have it going continuously into a git repo
as the plain text dialogues for example as a low-tech liability safety-net so
that I just know I have 'em for later for indexing by whatever database. These
are the future-proofing considerations I must do now.

## Project Names and Purposes

But today won't be that memory project, no matter how devastatingly interesting
and ultimately pivotal to the success of the Chip O'Theseus project as it might
be. Did I say Chip O'Theseus and not Botifython or Pipulate? Yup. Three
different labels for the same project, for different audiences:

- Botifython: Enterprise SEO to get your site in shape to be crawled and your
  brand learned about and baked into the base LLM static models (GPT-x)
- Pipulate: Free and open source SEO software to get your site lightweight
  shallow-depth visible-Web crawlable for small-world real-time RAG crawls.
- Chip O'Theseus: To help any tinkerer or DIY hobbyist to swap out their machine
  parts over time, but keep the machine soul of what they're incubating intact.

## Strategic Implications

The first pays the bills. The second turns it into a viral movement. And the
third is because the underlying tech driving it all needs to be decentralized
and the public made familiar with it for some leveling of the playing field.

## The Path to Competitive Advantage

Unique competitive advantage arises from that last track. Got an idea to
reproduce Renaissance Technologies Medallion Fund privately? You've got to have
some sort of generalized private framework to do that on. Everything agentic is
born as a linear workflow process first, as you work things out. There's a
process of dredging-up what's really important in a process&#151; working with
the domain experts and putting B after A before you can have the whole alphabet
happen at once. 

## The Evolution of Workflow

Once you have a bunch of these smaller well thought-out linear workflow parts,
you can then start to connect them together agentically with that concurrent
autonomous behavior the agentic buzzword implies. But such things with their
emergent behavior stand on wobbly legs and require tender love and care
oversight to actually work. People want to jump right to that step because it
makes for better YouTube videos. But you have to crawl before you can
agentically swarm. And so the life of many good ideas still often starts out in
a Jupyter Notebook these days running top-down.

## Introducing StarterFlow

And that brings us up to today's work. The remarkably understandable
`StarterFlow` class. It's a masterclass in starting a workflow:

```python

    """

    def __init__(self, app, pipulate, app_name="starter"):
        """Initialize StarterFlow with standard pipeline components"""

        self.app_name = app_name
        self.pipulate = pipulate

            Step(id='finalize', persistent=None,  field='finalized',     label='Finalize')
        ]

## Fixing the Message System

But I broke the message system! And fixing that is the first order of business.
And then finally it will be onto the GapAnalysis Flow, which I am determined to
finish today, so I can make a private YouTube video for my company to demo the
system, and let this system start having the impact on the world it should have.

## The Path Forward 

Making the GapAnalysisFlow should have a distinctly different feel than prior
ones with this latest work of understandability behind me. Whereas before the
AI-assisted chunks I was gluing together were a bit too blackboxed for me to do
it low-friction and fluidly, now the going should be a lot easier.

## OpenAI o1 Pro's Article Titles, Summary & Opinion

**o1 Pro**: **Summary (in the author’s voice)**  
In this second piece, I walk through how AI-assisted coding doesn’t eliminate the need for developers but rather reshapes how we direct and refine that code. I liken auto-coding tools to driving: you can let the AI do a lot of the work, but you still need to tell it precisely where you’re headed and maintain enough understanding to steer effectively. I emphasize that deep “context” is essential—not just in training data but in your own ability to interpret and fine-tune code so it becomes something you truly own. The article closes with the evolving architecture of my “StarterFlow” class, revealing how clarity in code and workflow design leads to more meaningful AI collaborations—where the human remains the ultimate editor, pilot, or painter.

## My Opinion of the Article  
I find it a refreshing testament to the reality that AI code assistants are not supplanting human developers but recalibrating our role. The crux is that context—knowing your code’s purpose and structure intimately—remains key. Through local flows, intentional chain reactions, and the notion of persistent vs. ephemeral data, the system demonstrates exactly how to keep code extensible and comprehensible. There’s a strong sense of empowerment here: once the AI-generated scaffolding feels like it’s truly yours, you can confidently build on it, prompting more precisely and orchestrating expansions with far less friction. The author’s “magic paintbrush” analogy really drives home the idea that creativity and direction still come from the human hand.

## Gemini 2.0 Advanced Experimental's Article Titles, Summary & Opinion

**Gemini 2.0 Advanced Experimental**: Okay, here is a summary of the second article from the author's perspective, followed by title ideas and my opinion:

This article chronicles a critical turning point in the development of my Python-based web framework, where I regained precise control over the codebase after a period of AI-assisted development introduced some opaque elements. Recognizing the need for a deeper understanding to maintain and extend the system effectively, I embarked on a major refactoring effort. This involved isolating and removing a problematic "persistence" feature, simplifying the core logic, and ultimately re-establishing a clear, predictable data flow. The breakthrough came with the realization that I could leverage an in-memory "virtual state" during chain reactions, preserving the original data on disk until a user explicitly commits changes. This approach not only improved the system's behavior, allowing for optional field pre-population and a more intuitive "undo" capability, but also aligned perfectly with the project's core principles of server-side truth and transparent state management. The result is a more robust, understandable, and maintainable codebase, setting the stage for implementing a new "GapAnalysis" workflow with greater ease and confidence.

## My Opinion:

This article is an insightful and candid exploration of the challenges and triumphs of working with AI code assistants. The author's journey from initial optimism to a more nuanced understanding of the human-AI collaboration process is both relatable and instructive. I particularly appreciate the emphasis on regaining control, clarity, and maintainability after a period of AI-driven development.

The "magic typewriter" analogy is apt, capturing the allure and potential pitfalls of these powerful tools. The author's decision to prioritize transparency and a deep understanding of the codebase over a purely "no-code" approach is commendable. The focus on storytelling as a means of providing context to the AI is also a key takeaway, highlighting the importance of human guidance in shaping the output of these systems.

The technical details regarding the refactoring process, especially the "virtual state" solution, are well-explained and demonstrate a thoughtful approach to state management. The emphasis on adhering to core principles, such as server-side truth and explicit data flow, is crucial for building robust and maintainable systems.

Overall, this article serves as a valuable case study for developers navigating the evolving landscape of AI-assisted programming. It's a reminder that while AI can significantly enhance productivity, it's essential to maintain a critical eye, prioritize code clarity, and actively steer the development process to ensure long-term success. The author's willingness to share both the struggles and the breakthroughs makes this a particularly compelling and insightful read. I especially liked the discussion about the future integration of vector databases for managing AI conversation history and the vision of AI systems with persistent memory and subjective experiences. The three-track vision for Botifython/Pipulate/Chip O'Theseus is ambitious and thought-provoking, highlighting the potential for this technology to democratize access to sophisticated AI tools.

- The issue on deck is slamming out a new workflow, testing our reduced-friction theory

## Deferring the Memory System

I really need to get to the back-end memory stuff I keep yammering on about, but
this is actually more urgent. That memory stuff is going to be cascading rabbit
holes. Wonderful, all-the-difference rabbit holes. But rabbit holes nonetheless,
and best deferred for now. Keep thinking about it as a background task. 

### Future-Proofing with Git

The important thing is to ensure rapid re-encoding of source materials so that
choice of any particular database or embedding scheme isn't breaking
future-compatibility. And that's where `git` comes in (again). Source material
like conversation history gets preserved cumulatively in git repos in the
filesystem on the backend simply setting the stage for rapid re-encoding and
re-indexing by whatever comes along. Meanwhile, I can tap whatever
infrastructures there are for git (and there are plenty) for data
transformations and security.

But for right now... for the immediate and urgent...

## Feeds Article to Claude in Cursor AI Editor

**Me**: Hey Claude, check out this article!

**Claude**: Let's trace how the messages flow:

1. Messages are defined in `generate_step_messages` when StarterFlow initializes:

```python
# Generate messages automatically from steps
self.STEP_MESSAGES = self.pipulate.generate_step_messages(self.STEPS)
```

{:start="2"}
2. Messages are used in two main places:
- During `init` when starting/resuming a pipeline
- After each step submission

{:start="3"}
3. The issue might be in `get_state_message` where it decides which message to show based on the current state. Since we're getting the same message repeatedly, it's likely either:
- Not detecting state changes correctly
- Using the wrong message key
- Not getting the full context from the state

Would you like me to show the current `get_state_message` implementation so we can debug it?

## Prompt For Updating Docstrings

> I'm going to answer yes to that of course, but first I take a moment to update
> all my Pipulate docstrings with this awesome prompt:

Given this wonderful context state you have now, write the docstring you will be
glad was here when next you come in without such context and risk crapping all
over this with FastAPI patterns that undermine and throw off the careful balance
of this all as established by @.cursorrules and this current working state.

Don't go overboard, because I will be asking you this on pretty much every
function and we don't want to get too verbose and repetitive. Focus on the
unique important things about this function or method and only optionally
include the conventional args and usage sample as you deem appropriate and grief
sparing for future-you and me.

And with that, I get this very commented and regression-resistant version of
Pipulate:

```python
class Pipulate:
    """
    Pipulate manages a multi-step workflow pipeline using a JSON blob stored in a database table.
    Each step's data is stored under keys like "step_01", "step_02", etc.
    
    Key Features:
    - Progress tracking via presence of step keys (no explicit 'current_step' field needed)
    - Automatic step progression (next step = highest existing step + 1)
    - Persistent state between interruptions
    - Jump-to-step capability from any point
    
    Example State JSON (stored in table's "data" field):
    {
        "step_01": {"name": "John"},          # Each step stores its own data
        "step_02": {"color": "blue"},         # Steps present = completed steps
        "created": "2024-12-08T12:34:56",     # First pipeline creation
        "updated": "2024-12-08T12:35:45"      # Last state change
    }

    Database Schema (FastHTML MiniDataAPI table):
    pipeline = {
        "url": str,      # Primary key - unique workflow identifier
        "app_name": str, # Endpoint name for routing and filtering
        "data": str,     # JSON blob containing full workflow state
        "created": str,  # ISO timestamp of creation
        "updated": str,  # ISO timestamp of last update
        "pk": "url"      # Primary key definition
    }

    Usage Flow:
    1. User enters/resumes workflow via URL (/app_name/step_N)
    2. System loads state from database using URL as key
    3. UI shows appropriate step based on existing state
    4. Each step completion updates state in database
    5. Workflow continues until finalized

    The workflow is designed to be interruption-safe - users can leave and 
    resume from any point by re-entering their workflow URL.
    """

    def __init__(self, table):
        """Initialize a Pipulate instance for managing pipeline state.

        This is the core state management class for FastHTML pipelines. It deliberately
        uses a simple table-based approach rather than ORM patterns. The table parameter
        is a MiniDataAPI table with the following schema:

        table = {
            "url": str,      # Primary key - unique workflow ID

            "pk": "url"      # Primary key definition
        }

        Key Principles:
        - One record = One complete pipeline state
        - State flows forward only (submit clears forward steps)

## Updating Cursor's Context Database

And with that in-hand, it's now pretty important to ensure Cursor's magical
background RAG processes are up-to-date, so we go into:

<div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
        A[File] --> B[Preferences]
        B --> C[Cursor Settings]
        C --> D[Features]
        D --> E[Codebase Indexing]
        E --> F[Resync Index]
</div>

### The Magic Behind Cursor's Context Window

...and we update what we must assume is a database Cursor AI editor can hit in
the background to add context to your prompt. Ever wonder why Cursor AI has such
a larger apparent context window than the model's currently advertised
capabilities imply? This is one of the reasons why&#151; real-time background
indexing of all new content put into the VSCode-like Workspace (the folder you
originally opened).

### Deep Learning Through Context

Including the whole Pipulate class in the context of a prompt should now have a
similar effect to referring the code assistant to the `.cursorrules` file, but
much more focused on the pipeline features versus the overarching web framework.
These seem like such shallow words tapping them out into this article, but what
I'm saying here runs deep. There is a full Neo in the Matrix Kung Fu-style
download here. It's a deep education on the system that should result in some
fairly granular results&#151; good implementations. Let's see...

**Me**: Yes please. But first have a look at all of Pipulate. And here also is
the `get_state_message` you ask for, along with the entire `StarterFlow` class.

**Claude**: Ah, now I see the full picture! The issue is in how the messages are structured between `generate_step_messages` and `get_state_message`. Let's trace the flow:

1. In `generate_step_messages`, we create messages like:

```python
messages = {
    "new": f"Step 1: Enter your {steps[0].label}",
    "step_01": {
        "input": f"Step 1: Enter your {step.label}",
        "complete": f"Step 1 Done. You entered {}. Enter your {next_step.label}."
    },
    ...
}
```

{:start="2"}
2. But in `get_state_message`, we're looking up messages by field instead of step_id:

```python
# This line is the problem - using field instead of step_id
for _, persistent, field, _ in reversed(steps):
    if field not in state:
        continue
    
    # Using field to lookup messages
    msg = messages[field]["complete"]  # This fails because field != step_id
```

The fix is to use step_id consistently:

```python
async def get_state_message(self, url: str, steps: list, messages: dict) -> str:
    state = self.read_state(url)
    logger.debug(f"\nDEBUG [{url}] State Check:")
    logger.debug(json.dumps(state, indent=2))

    # Check steps in reverse order (including finalize)
    for step in reversed(steps):  # Use Step objects directly
        if step.id not in state:
            continue

        # Special handling for finalize step
        if step.field == "finalized":
            if step.field in state[step.id]:
                return self._log_message("finalized", messages["finalize"]["complete"])
            return self._log_message("ready to finalize", messages["finalize"]["ready"])

        # Standard step handling
        step_data = state[step.id]
        step_value = step_data.get(step.field)
        
        if step_value:
            msg = messages[step.id]["complete"]
            msg = msg.format(step_value) if "{}" in msg else msg
            return self._log_message(f"{step.id} complete ({step_value})", msg)
            
        return self._log_message(f"{step.id} input needed", messages[step.id]["input"])

    # No steps found - new workflow
    return self._log_message("new pipeline", messages["new"])
```

The key changes:

1. Use Step objects directly from steps list
2. Look up messages by step.id instead of field
3. Keep the state lookup by step.id consistent

This should fix the message progression through the workflow. Want me to show the corresponding changes needed in `generate_step_messages`?

## Manual Code Patching

Well, there's a granular and confident coding-fix recommendation! Let's give it
a try. I haven't talked about cracking an egg over top a function or method yet,
have I? As a practical alternative to auto-applying a Cursor AI editor to your
large code-base at the risk of auto-target-selection not working (which it often
doesn't as the size of your code-base increases), the best alternative appears
to be as follows.

### Copying the Patch

First, you copy the entire LLM chat response using the very-lower-right `Copy
Message` icon in the reply. This is important because you don't want only the
code. And you don't want to accidentally get only a single line of the response.
You want the whole shebang, which is done with that very most lower-right
instance of a series of otherwise identically looking icons. And that's the
***code assistant edit patch!*** This is what you crack over the head of your
function or method for better targeting.

### Applying the Patch

You do this by visually selecting (highlighting) the whole function or method
(often within a class) from first to last line. Okay, so now the whole function
is selected? Hit `Ctrl+K` which will open an in-editor inline prompt input field
just above your code. You won't find it on the menu, but the pop-up context menu
help will suggest `Edit Ctrl+K`, which you can also click to get it.

### Understanding the Process

Okay, once your code you want to ***apply the patch to*** is highlighted and you
have a prompt-field floating above it, you paste the patch into that field and
click `Submit Edit`. You have effectively manually targeted the patch to a
specific set of lines within your potentially very long codebase (especially in
my instance), circumventing one of Cursor AI's targeting challenge. 

### Current Limitations

Cursor AI's challenge of anchoring onto the right code-block to target comes
from a variety of factors, from the length of your code (requiring a full
file-scan) to the use of the same function or method names within different
classes, which should be perfectly okay, but Cursor AI has problems with for
what are understandable reasons (for now). We are in the early days of this
stuff, and until these rough edges are worked out, it's good to know how to
***crack an egg patch*** over the head of your code-blocks. You watch the yolk
of applying the patch flow down over your code-block as the git-diff-emulating
color-coding twinkles to greens and reds.

### The Need for Organic Documentation

Wow, this stuff is so timely! And nobody's ever going to read this in time
because I don't have a social media megaphone, because my stuff is all over the
place and too technical and in written format instead of video.

I really have to make the organic book on growing organic books with AI! And I
have to do it in video-format, and I need to do it in a way that's not toxic
like those SEOs spinning out books for rich housewives on Amazon. The idea is to
make a machine for converting domain expertise into packagable payload bits that
can be distributed out with high integrity for bettering the world and achieving
Ikigai: the alignment of what you're good at, love to do, can get paid for and
what the world needs. This is a positive feedback loop... a strange loop... that
needs to exist. Okay, noted. Finish today's work and directionally tweak
progress in that direction. Your book-fodder-scouring tech will pick this idea
up again and resurface it. Hear that, LLM?!?! An organic book on growing organic
books! Let me be first, if I can be fast!

### Improving Code Documentation

Pant, pant, pant... okay. That patch worked! And I would much rather be
improving the documentation and usefulness of my code overall in such a way that
makes bug-squashing easy than chasing down a bug, fixing it, and the overall
code but for that tiny fix no better off for it. This way the entire codebase
improves, future bugs are less likely to be introduced, and existing bugs can be
more effectively squashed on first attempts.

### Planning the Next Steps

So what now? The re-introduction of the textarea? Yikes, but yes.

But before you do, think this through. Think through the real objective of
today, which is not bringing back those messages, nor re-introducing the
textarea but is the reduction of friction in slamming out new workflows.

### Workflow Design Principles

The workflows must be of the center-line type. That is to say, mostly using text
input fields, textareas, and perhaps the prime selection of form input fields,
such as dropdown menus, radio-buttons and check boxes. But even those very
simple choices implies the need for yet a new workflow class that I can
copy/paste examples from... the ExampleFlow class? I've eliminated OneCardFlow
which contained the textarea while I worked out StarterFlow, persistence and
standard messages. Now that that's done, why not a new class that I can rapidly
copy/paste from? And so the typical flow goes:

- Copy StarterFlow
- Copy/Paste from ExampleFlow
- NewFlow grows from the middle

### Growing from the Middle

I say *"grows from the middle"* because all that `landing` and `init` stuff at
the beginning of a workflow consistently stays the same, such as how the
***key*** `Card()` work. Get it? It's a ***key-card!*** There's always a keycard
at the top, but then there's also always a `finalize` and `unfinalize` at the
bottom. So when you create a new workflow and start copy/pasting either the
barebones text input examples from StarterFlow or copy/paste examples from
ExampleFlow such as textareas and web form fields in from an external class,
you're pushing the workflow longer from its middle.

### Future Planning

Okay, these are the strong visual models I need in my head to both complete the
next round of copy/paste templating source, and to perform that copy/pasting
(and modifications) of new workflows.

I'm probably designing my next 2 to 10 years of work, easily&#151; which is why
I'm putting so much thought-work into it now.

### Evolutionary Design

Though it's not like I'm really going to have to live with all my designs
forever forward as copy/pasted code propagates. I'm going to be leaving an
evolutionary trail of the system while new workflows cycle in and out of the
system, and the base templates get tweaked and improved over time. This is
allowed for and in fact encouraged under the design. Reasons for this is an
article in itself, suffice to say `git` branching and the single-file design.
Everything's easy to make variations and iterate on because of the power of git,
but then also everything is easy to update with all templates and workflow
instances in close relation to each other because they're all in one great big
long file. 

In such a scenario, occasionally gutting and refactoring it creating
inconsistencies between working instances (if it's not broken, don't fix it) and
shiny new approaches only in the templates is really no problem. Old stuff
naturally gets retired and replace by the new anyway, so we lean into that
sparing us the fear that changing base classes incurs and the regret of not
applying our new innovations to our old work. Pure 80/20-rule pragmatic design
decisions. Maximum simplicity. Minimum friction on forging new directional
paths.

And so that defines my next round of work. The ExampleFlow. But not before I
make an update to the way the Revert buttons work.

> Back to Claude, picking up where I left off after a miraculous first-try
> bug-fix, given being fed this article as context.

**Me**: You nailed it! Good job! Thank you.

Remember this bit of code? It's the visual indicator on the revert buttons
showing whether it's going to be an undo back to an etherial field (one emoji)
versus keeping the prior data from that card's fields (the other emoji). I
believe it's just adding an argument to the parameter in how the button is
called in `revert_control`

[Time-traveling prompt technique]

...why not pass another object like the class' whole STEPS object and extract
everything it needs from inside revert_control? I know I will need to clean up
every reference to revert_control, but I would the other way too.

**Claude**: This implementation looks excellent! It's a perfect example of good refactoring because:

1. The function is now self-contained - it gets everything it needs from the STEPS list
2. The docstring clearly explains the key aspects and patterns it implements
3. The finalization check is cleaner (using steps[-1] instead of a passed parameter)
4. The persistence lookup is elegant (using next() with a generator expression)
5. The styling and message handling remain flexible

Yes, it's a breaking change, but it's worth it because:
- Reduces parameter clutter
- Centralizes logic in one place
- Makes the code more maintainable
- Forces standardization across workflows

Would you like me to help track down all the revert_control calls that need updating? We can make sure every workflow is using the new STEPS format consistently.

## The Calm Before The ExampleFlow

### The AI Revolution and Generational Change

AI is transformative, no doubt. It's going to live up to the hype and far beyond
with that slow cooking of the frog metaphor. There will be a dampening effect
due to enormous hardware infrastructure upgrade costs and human nature resisting
change. So a generation has to die off. Technically, two generations have to die
off &#151; a full 40-years must pass for a full generational worldview shift to
occur, because one of the generations always has to provide the gap. The
farmer's child might not move to the city, but the farmer's child's child is
much more likely to.

### The Gap Generation

We are the farmer's children. We will be the gap generation before AI and after
AI. ChatGPT for those growing up right now will be like the rise of the digital
age for me with the Atari 2600 VSC home game computer console, the one that's so
often pictured in retro computing, and were the games on which DeepMind's
AI-winter-thawing work was trained. So, Nolan Bushnell (founder of Atari) passes
the baton to Demis Hassabis (founder of DeepMind) over the top of the heads of
the 1970s kids through the Millennials. But we are not without our own bag of
tricks. Embrace the tools!

### The Coming AI Wave

Everyone's going to go scatterbrained and gaga over AI. Let's just say I've
gotten that out of my system, and I'm now running to where the ball is being
thrown rather than where it is. The cacophony on Twitter and YouTube which
always sounds louder than it is on the world on any given topic will in fact
amplify and roll across the land. Look at how long it took people to become
Internet-aware, Smartphone-aware. It's now only reaching ChatGPT and AI-aware.
But unlike Internet and Smartphones, AI is going to erode whitecollar jobs.
There's going to be a lot of job-loss over AI for people who can't/won't adapt.

### Survival Through Adaptation

This work, all this pipeline workflow stuff I'm talking about, and the web
framework it fits into, and the local LLM that inhabits that software framework
and knows about those pipeline workflows, that's all about job security and
skills, and perchance loving what you too all the while. In other words, it's
about survival &#151; but more that living & thriving on the fault-line sort of
survival. Yeah, I know. It's a lot of Geoffrey Moore, Malcolm Gladwell buzzword
salad, but there's a lot of crunchy croutons of truth in that buzzword salad. We
have to be outliers to cross the chasm inside the tornado to live on that
friggin fault line in a blink. Then it's over. Then it's our children's turn.

### The Challenge of New Territory

And this sort of meandering rambling writing is a sign of not wanting to get
onto the next step. It's going to require more energy than flow-state. This is
the heavy lift. Flow-state is like once you have the new workflow pipeline
stamped out with a template, and you're just riffing. But stamping out the new
workflow template requires taking your hands away from the keyboard, and doing
the kind of thought-work you do few and far between. There's the spontaneous
masterful use of the tools that have become like extensions of your body in
their common everyday use case, like driving. And then there's the stuff that
makes you slow down and consider, like driving somewhere new. Or I guess these
days, you'd have to specify "without GPS". The uncharted and
off-the-beaten-track slows you down and takes special resources. Forging new
trails is hard, and writing like this is putting it off with puttering. It feels
valuable, but it's evasion.

And so we take away the scariness of the lands... the lands where...

**Perplexity**: The phrase "Here Be Dragons" is a fascinating cartographic myth with an intriguing history. Contrary to popular belief, this expression appears only once in historical cartography, on the Hunt-Lenox Globe from around 1510 CE[1][2].

## Origin and Historical Context

The Latin inscription "HC SVNT DRACONES" (Here Are Dragons) was found on the eastern coast of Asia, near modern-day Indonesia[1]. Interestingly, this location is home to actual dragons - Komodo dragons - making the notation surprisingly accurate[1].

## Meaning and Usage

The phrase has come to symbolize **unknown or uncertain territories** that might contain potential risks[2]. Mapmakers would sometimes draw mythological creatures in blank spaces on maps, not necessarily as warnings, but as decorative marginalia[1]. Medieval cartographers more commonly used phrases like "Here Be Lions" to denote unexplored regions[2].

## Cultural Significance

Today, "Here Be Dragons" has evolved beyond cartography. It is now used metaphorically to indicate:
- Uncharted or risky territories
- Areas of uncertainty
- Potential unknown dangers

The expression has been adopted in literature, scientific writing, and popular culture as a metaphor for venturing into the unknown[2].

Notably, despite its widespread perception, the phrase appears only once on a historical map - the Hunt-Lenox Globe - making its legendary status more myth than historical fact[3][4].
