## How to Not Be Blindsided By Nuance

The intensity of my work is only increasing as I near the finish-line of the
steep startup cost of a project. Any large endeavor front-loads expensive
startup costs, because you need to try things and learn the ropes. It's not like
you come out of the starting gate knowing all the nuance of subtlety of some new
thing, no matter how experienced you are. Today's article is about running into
all those new learnings with AIs, APIs and similarity to humans (in both
regards).

### Shoshin and Questioning First Principles

Sure, experience helps when you're tackling new stuff but if everything was
really that similar, there would be no challenges. The skill lies in sorting the
weird newness that takes special attention from things where your old chestnuts
make you immediately adept. Shoshin&151;be like a beginner or you're going to be
working off of bad initial assumptions, axioms, first principles or whatever
buzzword you wanna call your understandings at the outset.

### Frontier LLM AI Models Take Step Forward with 'o1-preview'

I bring this up because each LLM AI model you work with has its own nuances and
subtlety. They have slightly different sets of base assumptions you can make.
This wasn't so dramatic except maybe the move from ChatGPT 2 to 3 where you
really felt like you were talking to something significant. ChatGPT 4o as much
as it's assumed as the standard today doesn't give you much of a different vibe
than 3. But the new o1-preview model takes another one of those leaps, and it's
easy to feel it's super-intelligent. I can see what the big hullabaloo about the
***strawberry*** codename was. What did Ilya see, and all that. Well, I've been
using it awhile now, and as brilliant as the version of it that reached the
public is, it can still lull you into a false sense of security of its ability
then blindside you with its own blindness. Ouch! 

## Approaching AI Like a New Employee at a Job

That was yesterday. It's not going to be able to look at 2 codebases loaded with
its own subtlety tied to how browsers render things and how the http
communication goes on in the background and statefulness is maintained and be
able to switch you over from one way of doing things to another. At least not
without a lot of pain from being isolated from factors that you shouldn't be
isolating yourself from. You should let yourself get up-close and personal with
the porting issues so when it fumbles, you know precisely where. Or better
still, so that the way you prompt it to help you never actually opens the
opportunity for the fumble. In other words, you can approach interaction with AI
the same way you would with a clueless fresh out of high school employee on
their first job, or in the way Joel Spolsky talked about it in his... uh...
uh...

## Joel Spolsky's Ancient Bugs Article Still Relevant Today

**Me**: What is the Joel Spolsky seminal article on not letting bugs get into your software in the first place? The whole proactive limiting the opportunity for them to arise thing?

**Perplexity**: The article you are referring to is likely "Hard-assed Bug Fixin'" by Joel Spolsky, published on his blog, Joel on Software, on July 31, 2001[2]. In this article, Spolsky discusses strategies for identifying and fixing bugs that are economically worth addressing. He emphasizes the importance of fixing bugs only when the value of having them fixed outweighs the cost. The article also details methods such as trapping bugs on demo servers and collecting logs from crashing applications to proactively identify and address issues before they become widespread. This proactive approach aligns with the concept of preventing bugs from arising in the first place.

## Eating The Frog to Take Stress Off Yourself

The main thing this morning is to not get distracted. This tiny time window you
are allowing yourself for laying the foundations of this defending-against-bugs
port is slim. Ugh, it's not like you're going to make a hail mary play and
finish the port this morning. You have to take the stress off yourself of the
upcoming meeting, and switch into that mode.

## Even The Hound Must Rest

Hit it out of the ballpark with managing meetings today. First of all, think out
loud about the process and go ahead and blog it right here. There's no shame in
trying to be (or at least look) competent in an aspect of your job you're being
distracted from by a true passion. This coding stuff and the challenge of being
on the chase like the way Watson used to describe Holmes on the scent of a case
is exactly the trilling feeling of coding an interesting project. 

## Using Gamification Algorithms for Self-Control and Productivity Gains

It's just the right level of just-beyond-reach but around the corner you need.
The game gamification and level-seeking and unlocks has been used a lot lately
for the kind of addiction developers of ***the algorithms*** are using to get
you and keep you addicted to social media for that slot-machine pulling dopamine
rush. Doom-scrolling and dragging down at the top of a feed for a refresh.
Insidious stuff, but you can use that power for good with self life-hacks.

## I'm Hoping that Using My Chip O'Theseus Linux Server Will Help

One of the places I can find the love in everyday client management work is the
fact that I get to use my new home work server machine that I decked out with
NixOS and an NVidia GPU gaming card for local LLM work without that disjointed
feeling of switching back and forth with the Macbook laptop for office software
compatibility issues. Thankfully, we're not a Microsoft Office shop, and most
everything is web-based. But I just put a Logitech MX Brio 4K webcam on my Linux
machine and it worked like a charm. Likewise, I now have Slack and Zoom
installed, and they're similarly solid. They were all just additions to my
`configuration.nix` file, which still just blows my mind. 

## NixOS Made Getting Slack, Zoom & a Webcam on Linux Oddly Easy

There's not really software installation on NixOS. There's only adjusting the
file that defines your overall system and a quick rebuild. It's a game changer
that even obsoletes for the most part the whole Docker container movement for
most purposes. Anyway, being able to do everything now in a sort of
forever-Linux definitely infuses the love into it. Purging Microsoft and Apple
dependency out of your life is both cathartic and future-proofing in a way
that's personally satisfying and good for your career.

## The Joy of Pairing Down the Cruft

Ugh, more writing rabbit hole! Everything is just so interesting again by virtue
of the pairing-down of the cruft and not embracing more. It's a feeling I
haven't had since the Amiga computer, and to a lesser extent, the original
iPhone. Anyhoo... force that shift in thinking and ***use this time window!*** 

## Big Context Windows & What Ilya Saw a Disappointment

Alright, so a shift in thinking. The stressful time-window I was working with
was hardly enough to finish the web app port, and I want to do a great job with
polish, and I'm not going to do it stressing. I look at my old implementation
and realize no matter how bad my database/streaming decisions were, the process
flow and details are spot-on. It's going to take tender love & care to
reproduce&#151;not something I want to rush, and I'd rather go late into the
night again. The solutions are percolating in my head. What comes next is the entire
opposite of dumping 2 codebases into o1-preview, Gemini 1.5 Pro (or whatever
model can handle a few million tokens) like I did first. 

## I Must Control The Horizontal & Vertical

Magic wands and hand-waving! We all want it. A superintelligent surrogate parent
with our best interests at heart advising us with omnipresent wisdom. It's
feeling we've got that initially (what Ilya saw), but that's a siren's
song&#151;as much of a hallucination as they're adept at making. It's better to
be the magician or the man behind the curtain than the people being amazed at
the show. Okay, even this article could go on forever as its own sort of rabbit
hole. That gets to process. Process-breaking, that is. The rabbit hole
evaluation escape clause that re-focuses you on the 80-20 solutions. In this
case it goes like this...

## List It Out

1. What is my time window. Work backwards. And what is the goal? To please the
   client of course and move things on modestly but competently to the next step
   in the relationship. So the call is at 2:00 PM. Work backwards!
2. Quit out of everything else that is a distraction. If they can't seize your
   attention, they can't derail you. Close all apps and browser windows but
   this, the work browser profile, and private notes. This step is painful
   because it's my whole developer environment I'm quitting out of and I feel
   naked without it, but it's too distracting.
3. Communicate! I've got a 3-hour window, but that includes client communication
   like sending things out ahead of time. I've been so distracted by
   foundation-building I don't know as much as I should. So know what you should
   but put a time-limit on it.
4. List links! This means make a list of assets and resources, preferably ones
   that have web links so you can pull them up quickly. Make them their own
   folder in one of your profiles so it sync's across machines. They are:

Okay, organize your mind like a YAML file. Minimal syntax. Good use of key/value
pairs. Low friction. We want a bulleted list...

- One
- Two
- Three

But we also want key/value pairs:

- key: value
- key2: value2
- key3: value3

But we also want to imply CONSTANTS:

- CLIENT_WEBSITE: https://www.<theirs>.com/
- SHARED_SLACK_CHANNEL: https://botify.slack.com/archives/<theirs>
- INTERNAL_SLACK_CHANNEL: https://botify.slack.com/archives/<theirs>

This may all seem super-obvious but it doesn't come so natural to me. When the
"fixed locations" are outside this timeless future-proofing mental construct I
made for myself, the details are not sticky. But this is the kind of
statefulness and side-effects that make all the difference. Yup, it's a
functional versus procedural thing again. I favor functional. All stateful stuff
evaporates away when you leave the function. This is a problem. I cannot let
myself be this way. I have to rigorously pin up things I must remember in places
I cannot help but look until the appropriate habits kick in and its automatic.

Okay, so that's knowing where to find things. So go find them! Ugh! I am slack
challenged. How can someone who was on IRC (Internet Chat Relay) that started
this who type of group chat UI be so difficult for me. Oh, the subtlety and
nuance again! I'm not old. I just object to investing so much cognitively into
some faddish vendor product who has managed to grab business by the balls. Yeah,
it's not that I am not good at this kind of software. It's that it's a violation
of the 80/20-rule. It takes 80% of the benefit you want to put into it to get
only 20% of the benefit. But people *"get into it"* and it gives them that cool
elite club feeling. Okay, eff-it. It's eating the frog. Get down your slack
tricks. Make it not miserable.

Right-click everything on the left-hand navigator and set `Show and sort` to
`All`. I can't have variable behavior! It took me forever to understand why
things I was starring was not showing up under starred. If there's new stuff it
will bold. Rely on seeing things go bold.

Take the 2 shortcuts to those slack channels and also make them bookmarks in
your work-profile browser! So you're ***designing your bookmarks*** to be both
the experience you need to get organized in preparation for meetings, and every
day really by being in your face in one of those ***can't help but encounter***
repetitively valuable pieces of cognitive real estate locations. It's got a good
pattern so far:

- client site
- internal slack
- shared slack

Forget the stars. Unstar everything. It was useless. Use a `Priority` section.
Learn the language. They're *Sections*. A priority section gets a little chili
pepper emoji. That will help. Always click the chili pepper! Un-expand
everything. Expanded accordion navigation menus are the enemy. It's the same
thing I hate about VSCode. If everything is equally prevalent, then nothing is.
It's massive focus-dilution and I find that ability to focus so valuable.

Next is ***only expand `Priority`*** and keep everything else collapsed. And hit
the `Home` icon repeatedly. Everything gets confusing with 1 or 2 clicks in
Slack, and like Dorothy, we must keep repeating "there's no place like home...
there's no place like home..." to clear up the Slack clutter and cognitive
overload. I don't know how people with focus problems can even use that thing.
There must be such a slack-hater subculture out there.

Okay... so anyway, Slack wrangled. 

I can easily ***find*** where I need to look to finish
that above bullet-list of assets I need to familiarize myself with to do client
work effectively. Agendas and deliverables ready for the meeting? Ha! Just be
prepared with some solid next steps on things I can turn around fast after the
meeting! But the agenda is a must. Follow co-worker patterns.
