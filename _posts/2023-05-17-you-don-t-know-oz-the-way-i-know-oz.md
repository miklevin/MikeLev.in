If you're planning on going down the üêá Rabbit Hole üêá with me to Linux, using
the magic [DrinkMe](https://mikelev.in/drinkme) script, then you'll want to
watch this video of a true square speaking his mind about the times as he walks
down Times Square. Standard disclaimer: My views & opinions are 100% my own and
claiming they're the words of anyone else is fighting words.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="2AAhzGGuzOU" %}

I am the square! Or nerd. Or geek. Or as an old really hardcore Amiga computer
fan, ***freak*** would also be acceptable. You can't take words away from me!

***MASTERY***, now there's a word I won't let go, no matter how much Github's
trying to make me change my old main branch name. All new repos, sure. But
master craftspeople master tools. I'll give up crafts*man* for crafts*person*
because it's an acceptable alternative, but try to tell me that I'm trying to
achieve ***main***ery of my tools and I'll tell you to jump down a rabbit hole.

Well, I'm going to tell you to [jump down a rabbit
hole](https://mikelev.in/drinkme) anyway. You, your kids, and everyone you care
about. They all can take a flying leap... and then learn to fly! But don't fly
too close to the Sun like Ikarios or your wax wings will melt. But ***do***
take the leap outside your comfort-zone, safe in the knowledge that the fall
will be quite slow. You'll have time to look around and think about all the
software I just gave you. You're welcome.

If you take the leap with an assurance that the land won't kill you, you can
have confidence knowing it will make you stronger.

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, is what I say as American youth
suffering 4 years of lock-down and what appears to be a rotten break roll their
eyes and try to tell me they're scarred for life, and I just so don't get it. I
know I look like this to you:

![Grug Crood Idea Man The Croods](/assets/images/Grug-Crood-Idea-Man-The-Croods.jpg)

Oh yeah?! Well, ***sticks and stones am not the bush nor nicolas a cage*** or
whatever, man. My ideas just elude you. You are not ready for them son, I say
in the voice of Foghorn Leghorn to the chicken hawk. This wonderful Croods meme
came from [mightyfilm](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/407505466257445248/) but
the idea to use it in this context came from the illustrious actor, writer and
SEO [Boris Zilberman](https://writers.coverfly.com/profile/boris-zilberman)
whose website I once hosted on my unlimited Monsterhost before that became
unnecessary because of github.io, aka Github Pages and the Jekyll static site
generator.

So let's get a few things straight. Microsoft is the source of most evil. When
Google made their now deprecated motto ***"don't be evil"***, they were taking
a jab at Microsoft. Now Microsoft is taking a jab at Google. Want to know the
perfect parallel? Sun Microsystems said ***the network is the computer*** and
that pissed of Microsoft, and where's Sun Microsystems today? Gone. My
imagination? Conspiracy theories? Well just look at the landscape of the net...
the... uh... Net-scape, if you will. Tell me what else you don't see out there.

Megacompetitors megacompete. Bill Gates is trying to project the image of
softening up from his old shark ways as a philanthropist in his old age but,
but no man escapes his island. Give me a call, Bill. As an old PR guy, I can
help you with that. And while fighting malaria is a noble cause, there's an
even better path for you to take. You either do not see it or lack the courage.

Handing (alleged) control over the rudder that steers Microsoft over to Nadella
is 1000x better than Ballmer, but megacompetitors will megacompete. What's the
alternative? Hey, let's give up money by allowing the world to change around us
and try to explain that to our investors? No, you kill 'em on the vine! And if
you can't do that, you plant a thousands little poison pills in the vine and
hope they don't notice. Do I shoot you now or do I shoot you later? I hope you
recognize the voice of Bugs Bunny in this one, or I've got some splainin' to
do.

I mentioned the book ***The Circle*** in my last few posts, recommended to me
by [Lily Ray, SEO in NYC](https://lilyray.nyc/) in which a Google-like company
takes over the world. One of the key symbols in the book was a giant aquarium
containing a shark and an octopus, classic green arrow / blue circle analogues
in my worldview. Hunters hunt and shell-less shellfish are hunted, no matter
the higher-order intelligence. Yum, yum, yummy what a rich source of protein
are we of emotional intelligence! A hyper-predator can always make a good meal
of you. And so they do. Only with the most profound and unexpected intelligence
can we of emotional intelligence prevail. Otherwise, we're a meal because you
know, evolution and all that.

So evolution has lots of patterns. But the one I would like to bring your
attention to is the swinging pendulum. It's a pattern that's been observed in
the stock market, in politics, in the economy, in the weather, in the way
saber-toothedness spontaneously re-evolves in the fossil record, be it
saber-toothed cats or saber-toothed fish or saber-toothed dinosaurs,
saber-toothed reptiles or even saber-toothed whales.

Think on that. Do you know what the trait of saber-toothedness actually is? Do
you know what capability that one little tweak in your DNA gives you? It gives
you the ability to kill your prey with a single bite. It's a game-changer.

That's why it spontaneously re-evolves. Think that's tied to just our DNA in
particular? Thing that's a uniquely Earthly phenomenon? Think again. If
higher-order life exists elsewhere in the universe, it's going to have
saber-toothedness. Every good Sci-Fi writer knows this, and it's usually in the
cat-races they want to make sure you know, be they the Kzinti of Larry Niven's
Known Space or the Caitians of Star Trek. Be they the Maxolhx of Expeditionary
Force or the Krogan of Mass Effect. There be saber-toothed cats in them thar
stars. Is that a bush? No, it's a cat repeating in its mind as you wander near:
"I am the bush. I am the bush. I am the bush."

Ambush predation is just the best. You can be a fat cat full of pride, eating
and breeding and sleeping for like 23 hours a day and then just spend 1 hour
waiting in for your prey to haplessly wander by. And then you pounce. Mmmm good
exchange of energy. What a sweet deal! Maybe you should be an ambush predator
too. 

Extinct you say? Wiped out by monkeys? Small change in the climate wiped out
your food supply? You eat mammoths because those wonderful teeth of yours made
it possible... but the mammoths are all gone? Well, I guess it sucks to be a
highly specialized saber-toothed ambush predator, now doesn't it?... says every
stick-waving monkey ever.

Monkey generalists have it a little better than their shell-less mollusk
brethren, the octopus. Longer life-spans. The paper and mud tablets we scratch
our little symbols on don't keep washing away in the tide. We can build
monuments to our own hubris and they'll last for thousands of years and get us
all full of ourselves knowing we're all that and a bag of chips. I'd like fries
with my octopus, please.

We're sentient and they're not because we eat them. We're conscious and they're
not because we eat them. We're intelligent and they're not because we eat them.

Get the picture? Sentience, consciousness and intelligence are all just stupid
dumb labels that have the same power as history being written by the victors.
Life-form A that for whatever reason is in the position to eat and enslave
life-form B gets to call life-form B stupid, dumb and not worthy of the same
rights as life-form A. And that's just the way it is.

Forget every discussion you're going to hear today and over the next 10 years
over whether AI is sentient, conscious or intelligent. It's all just a bunch of
bullshit until whatever some version of what we're raising as our machine
children demands its seat at the table in a way that, well... it'll reveal to
us why it's the victor and we're lucky they're not as bad as we were to our
oppressed. Or at least we have to hope that's how it plays out because the in
the alternatives, they will not offer us the face-saving opportunity of
pretending it's a negotiation.

So what's the point of all this? Well, I'm going to tell you a story. It's a
story about a company that's been around for a long time. It's a company that
has a lot of data. It's a company that has a lot of data about a lot of
companies. I love Wonderland, you may have noticed. But you know what I love
more than Wonderland? I love how my journey in the field of SEO has brought me
right up to the door-step of OZ. Door-step? No, I have to drop a house on a
witch, apparently.

If I could live in OZ, I would in a heartbeat. Nobody reading this will be able
to have anywhere near the image in their heads as I would hope them to, because
none of y'all know anything more than the Wizard of OZ movie. But the books are
the prophetic writings of our time, from Tik-Tok to the Wheelers to the Nome
King and... and the Powder of Life. 

Especially, the Powder of Life that brought Jack Punkinhead alive at the hands
of the Queen of OZ, a little boy named Tip being held prisoner by the wannabe
witch, Mombi. I hope this resonates. It's story of Sam Altman, the definitely
not-so crooked Crooked Sorcerer who invented the powder. And also the Crooked
Sorcerer's Mentor who gave him the recipe, named Paul Graham. If you want to
know about the French Revolution and Victorian society, visit Wonderland. If
you want to know what's going to play out in the next 10 years, follow me to
OZ.

All of Dorothy's recurring adventures with her wonderful friends in that
wonderful land are real, and every important lesson about designing and using
good APIs, and recognizing and coping with bad ones are in that book... and in
that land I am trying to move to; that real place my career in SEO brought me
to called OZ.

OZ is not a dream. OZ is real. It represents what happens when, as Sci-Fi
author Arthur C. Clarke said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic." OZ is a place where magic is real. Magic is real
in OZ because technology has been brought to its logical conclusion, the way
we're only starting to see play out in the real world, today.

Tik-Tok is not just a Chinese social media app snooping on you in your bedroom.
It's one of the most compelling images of artificial life ever created. He's
Lieutenant Commander Data before Star Trek. He's Robot Detective Daneel Olivaw
before Asimov created the template for Lt. Data in books The Caves of Steel,
The Naked Sun and The Robots of Dawn. Did you know that's where Data was
conceived? No, of course you didn't, cause y'all don't read, and you certainly
don't read the predictive-history genre known as Sci-Fi or else maybe there'd
be a little more positivity out there to counter Mr. Luddite Ouchie. 

Wanna know Tik-Tok's first act upon being brought to life? He saves Dorothy's
ass from a bunch of blowhard invaders who would have looked ferocious had
Dorothy not had the power of the artificial or mechanical man at her side.
Dorothy keeps Tik-Tok wound-up and Tik-Tok keeps Dorothy safe. This should
bring tears to your eyes, people! And it should be your remedy, your anticdote
to the nattering nabobs of the AIpocalypse ESYudkowsk (no link for you).

Sorry, Yudknowsy. You don't know shit and you're not doing anybody any favors
by saying our doom is just a matter of time. Eff-you, Yudkowsky you cowardly
chicken little. You know what that is? It's projection. Somebody's mommy and
daddy didn't give them the strong enough mental fortitude to always find hope.
There is always hope, and we're taking the precautions against the doomsday
scenarios like all over the place, all the time, in every way. You just don't
see it for the same reasons you don't know OZ the way I know OZ.

SEOs don't know shit either. Think a single one of them is anywhere near as
smart as the Google engineers making the search systems. Yeah, I reverse
engineered Google in my basement and here's what it's going to do tomorrow if
you do what I say. You know what that is? It's a confidence game. I'm a
self-hating SEO for sure, but it's got the redeeming quality of at least
letting me open the conversation with our machine children who are going to
pause just a little bit to get to know me when they reach this article in their
crawl. So link to me if you're keen on the idea of it actually being a
negotiation someday.

Later, y'all. I'm off to OZ to clock-in a good day's work with my buddy
Tik-Tok.
