You are not watching this video of your free will. Nothing is random. We're all
pre-programmed. Really? Maybe. Wow, watch this dude and think about it. Is the
belief in superdeterminism scientific or is it a faith like the belief in the
multiverse? Does anything non-falsifiable even belong in science? I guess
that's what metascience and pseudoscience are for. I was accused of believing
in pseudoscience for believing in quantum mechanics, and specifically QED.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="zAna4nBZNZk" %}

I've had a burning desire of late to know whether quantum computing was showing
like any results at all, or whether everything is just bullshit. The quantum
supremacy announcements have been of interest. Anything indicating that anyone
has calculated anything and that it has any properties that aren't more
intelligently pursued through optimized but traditional technology. Will
quantum super-science lead anywhere. The quantum deniers I've been YouTubing
lately certainly think the bottom will fall out of quantum computing, because
they think quantum computers aren't real.

Having the New Bing on both desktop and mobile, but particularly on mobile, has
been a sheer delight. It'd be a distraction from work if it weren't so tied to
my work. And so I decided to pursue the claims of the quantum deniers to their
source with the help of good ol' Bing AI. I don't know math all that well, but
want to start learning math along the way. Someone let me down somewhere in not
turning on a lifetime love for math, an pattern that I believe I'm repeating
with my kid who almost beats me up at the word. So it's anything but the label
"math". Let's talk Python!

Hey Bing, I want to learn some math. Start me out with the generally
recommended order in which to learn math. I don't necessarily want to stick to
this. I think I am a stronger visual or symbolic thinker and get tripped up on
math syntax a lot especially across algebra and calculus. Recommend an order to
take up math so as to plan to nurture a blossoming love of the math and beauty
and implied truth inherent in math.

List the basic premise, axioms or first principles of each of these categories of math.

That's a very broad question. Each category of math has many subtopics and concepts that are based on different premises, axioms or first principles. It would be impossible to list them all in a short answer.

However, I can give you a brief overview of some of the basic premises of algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus. These are not exhaustive or rigorous definitions, but rather intuitive explanations to help you get started.

- Algebra is the field of mathematics that deals with using symbols, variables and arithmetic operations to represent and manipulate mathematical situations¹. For example, x + 10 = 0 is an algebraic equation that uses a variable x to represent an unknown number. One of the basic premises of algebra is that we can use properties of equality and inverse operations to solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation. Another basic premise is that we can simplify algebraic expressions by combining like terms and using the order of operations².
- Geometry is the field of mathematics that deals with shapes, angles, distances, areas and volumes³. For example, a triangle is a geometric shape that has three sides and three angles. One of the basic premises of geometry is that we can use definitions, postulates and theorems to prove statements about geometric figures⁴. Another basic premise is that we can use formulas and measurements to calculate various properties of geometric figures.
- Trigonometry is the field of mathematics that deals with the relationships between angles and sides of right triangles. For example, sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse is a trigonometric ratio that relates an angle θ in a right triangle to its opposite side and hypotenuse. One of the basic premises of trigonometry is that we can use trigonometric ratios and inverse functions to find missing angles or sides in right triangles. Another basic premise is that we can use trigonometric identities and equations to simplify or solve more complex problems involving angles.
- Calculus is the field of mathematics that deals with rates of change and limits. For example, dy/dx = f'(x) is a derivative that represents how fast a function y = f(x) changes with respect to x. One of the basic premises of calculus is that we can use limits to define derivatives and integrals as well as evaluate indeterminate forms. Another basic premise is that we can use rules and techniques such as chain rule, product rule, quotient rule etc., integration by parts etc.,to find derivatives or integrals for various functions.

I hope this gives you some idea about these categories of math. If you want more details or examples for any specific topic within these categories please let me know.

Repeat this exercise but instead of just words, demonstrate each example with Python code.

OK, I will try to demonstrate each example with Python code. Please note that this is not a comprehensive or accurate way of implementing these mathematical concepts in Python, but rather a simple and illustrative way of showing some basic operations and functions.
Algebra: To represent and manipulate algebraic expressions and equations in Python, we can use variables, operators and built-in functions such as eval(), solve() and simplify() from the sympy library. For example:

```python
# Import sympy library
import sympy as sp

# Define a variable x
x = sp.Symbol('x')

# Define an algebraic expression
expr = 2*x**2 + 3*x - 5

# Print the expression
print(expr)

# Simplify the expression
expr = sp.simplify(expr)

# Print the simplified expression
print(expr)

# Define an algebraic equation
eqn = sp.Eq(x + 10, 0)

# Print the equation
print(eqn)

# Solve the equation for x
sol = sp.solve(eqn)

# Print the solution
print(sol)
Output:
2*x**2 + 3*x - 5
2*x**2 + 3*x - 5
Eq(x + 10, 0)
[-10]
```

Geometry: To represent and manipulate geometric shapes and figures in Python, we can use classes, methods and attributes from the math or numpy libraries. For example:

```python
# Import math library
import math

# Define a class for triangles
class Triangle:

    # Initialize the triangle with three sides a,b,c
    def __init__(self,a,b,c):
        self.a = a # side a
        self.b = b # side b
        self.c = c # side c

    # Define a method to calculate the perimeter of the triangle
    def perimeter(self):
        return self.a + self.b + self.c

    # Define a method to calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula
    def area(self):
        s = (self.a + self.b + self.c)/2 # semi-perimeter
        return math.sqrt(s*(s-self.a)*(s-self.b)*(s-self.c)) # area

    # Define a method to check if the triangle is right-angled using Pythagoras' theorem
    def is_right(self):
        return (self.a**2 + self.b**2 == self.c**2) or (self.b**2 + self.c**2 == self.a**2) or (self.c**2 + self.a**2 == self.b**2)

# Create an instance of Triangle with sides 3,4,5
t = Triangle(3,4,5)

# Print the perimeter of t
print(t.perimeter())

# Print the area of t
print(t.area())

# Check if t is right-angled
print(t.is_right())
Output:
12
6.0
True
```

Trigonometry: To represent and manipulate trigonometric ratios and functions in Python, we can use constants such as pi and methods such as sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan() etc., from the math library. For example:

```python
import math

def degrees_to_radians(degrees):
    return degrees * math.pi /180

def radians_to_degrees(radians):
    return radians *180 /math.pi


def sin(angle_in_degrees):
    angle_in_radians=degrees_to_radians(angle_in_degrees)
    return math.sin(angle_in_radians)


def cos(angle_in_degrees):
    angle_in_radians=degrees_to_radians(angle_in_degrees)
    return math.cos(angle_in_radians)


def tan(angle_in_degrees):
    angle_in_radians=degrees_to_radians(angle_in_degrees)
    return math.tan(angle_in_radians)


def asin(ratio):

   angle_in_radians=math.asin(ratio)
   return radians_to_degrees(angle_in_radians)


def acos(ratio):

   angle_in_radians=math.acos(ratio)
   return radians_to_degrees(angle_in_radians)


def atan(ratio):

   angle_in_radians=math.atan(ratio)
   return radians_to_degrees(angle_in_radians)


angle_1=30


angle_1_sin=sin(30)

angle_1_cos=cos(30)

angle_1_tan=tan(30)


ratio_1=0.5


ratio_1_asin=asin(0.5)

ratio_1_acos=acos(0.5)

ratio_1_atan=atan(0.5)


print(f
```


Continue

OK, I will continue with the calculus example.

Calculus: To represent and manipulate derivatives and integrals in Python, we can use functions such as diff(), integrate(), limit() etc., from the sympy library. For example:

```python
# Import sympy library
import sympy as sp

# Define a variable x
x = sp.Symbol('x')

# Define a function f(x) = x**2 + 2*x - 3
f = x**2 + 2*x - 3

# Print the function
print(f)

# Find the derivative of f(x) using diff()
f_prime = sp.diff(f,x)

# Print the derivative
print(f_prime)

# Find the integral of f(x) using integrate()
f_int = sp.integrate(f,x)

# Print the integral
print(f_int)

# Find the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 using limit()
f_lim = sp.limit(f,x,0)

# Print the limit
print(f_lim)
Output:
x**2 + 2*x - 3
2*x + 2
x**3/3 + x**2 - 3*x
-3
```

I hope this helps you understand how to use Python code to demonstrate some basic math concepts. Do you have any questions or feedback?

Do again but use short and sometimes incomplete python examples so you can get through each math type in one response. Just include enough so it is a good launching off point for later investigation.

OK, I will try to use short and sometimes incomplete python examples for each math type. Please note that these are not meant to be fully functional or accurate code snippets, but rather simple and illustrative examples to give you some idea of how to use Python for math.

Algebra: To use symbols, variables and operations in Python, we can import sympy library and use its functions such as solve(), simplify() etc. For example:

```python
import sympy as sp
x = sp.Symbol('x')
expr = 2*x**2 + 3*x - 5
sol = sp.solve(expr) # solve for x
print(sol)
Geometry: To use shapes, angles and formulas in Python, we can import math or numpy libraries and use their classes, methods and attributes. For example:
import math
class Triangle:
    def __init__(self,a,b,c):
        self.a = a # side a
        self.b = b # side b
        self.c = c # side c
    def area(self):
        s = (self.a + self.b + self.c)/2 # semi-perimeter
        return math.sqrt(s*(s-self.a)*(s-self.b)*(s-self.c)) # area using Heron's formula

t = Triangle(3,4,5) # create a triangle object with sides 3,4,5
print(t.area()) # print its area
```

Trigonometry: To use angles, sides and ratios in Python, we can import math library and use its constants such as pi and methods such as sin(), cos(), tan() etc. For example:

```python
import math

def degrees_to_radians(degrees):
    return degrees * math.pi /180

def radians_to_degrees(radians):
    return radians *180 /math.pi

angle_1=30

angle_1_sin=math.sin(degrees_to_radians(angle_1)) # convert angle to radians and find its sine value

ratio_1=0.5

ratio_1_asin=radians_to_degrees(math.asin(ratio_1)) # find the inverse sine of the ratio and convert it to degrees

print(angle_1_sin)
print(ratio_1_asin)
```

Calculus: To use derivatives, integrals and limits in Python, we can import sympy library and use its functions such as diff(), integrate(), limit() etc. For example:

```python
import sympy as sp
x = sp.Symbol('x')
f = x**2 + 2*x - 3 # define a function f(x)

f_prime = sp.diff(f,x) # find the derivative of f(x)

f_int = sp.integrate(f,x) # find the integral of f(x)

f_lim = sp.limit(f,x,0) # find the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0

print(f_prime)
print(f_int)
print(f_lim)
```

These are some short python examples for each math type. I hope they are useful for you. Do you have any questions or feedback?

Yes they are helpful, thank you. What are the most famous and easy to reproduce experiments in science to prove principles, axioms and assumptions of science and our natural world. Include 2-slits, cloud chambers to detect particles, Brownian motion to prove atoms, and more experiments like that.

I'm glad you are interested in science experiments. There are many famous and easy to reproduce experiments in science that can help you understand some of the principles, axioms and assumptions of science and our natural world. Here are some examples:

- Two-slit experiment: This is one of the most famous experiments in quantum physics that demonstrates the wave-particle duality of light and matter. You can perform this experiment at home with a laser pointer, two razor blades, a cardboard box and a white screen⁵. The basic idea is to shine a laser beam through two narrow slits on a cardboard box and observe the interference pattern on a white screen behind it. The interference pattern shows that light behaves like a wave when it passes through the slits, but also like a particle when it hits the screen.

- Cloud chamber: This is an experiment that allows you to see ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays. You can make your own cloud chamber with a clear plastic container, dry ice, alcohol, felt and a flashlight. The basic idea is to create a supersaturated vapor of alcohol inside the container by placing dry ice below it and felt soaked with alcohol above it. When ionizing radiation passes through the vapor, it leaves behind trails of condensation that you can see with a flashlight.

- Brownian motion: This is an experiment that shows the random movement of microscopic particles suspended in a fluid due to collisions with molecules. You can observe this phenomenon with a microscope, water, pollen grains or other small particles. The basic idea is to place a drop of water containing some pollen grains on a microscope slide and watch them under high magnification. You will see that the pollen grains move erratically in different directions due to collisions with water molecules.

- Mendel's pea plant experiment: This is one of the first experiments that explored inherited traits and genetics. You can re-create this experiment with different varieties of pea plants that have distinct characteristics such as flower color, seed shape or pod color². The basic idea is to cross-pollinate two pea plants with different traits and observe their offspring's traits over several generations. You will discover some patterns of inheritance such as dominant and recessive traits.

These are some examples of famous and easy to reproduce experiments in science. I hope they inspire you to try them out yourself or learn more about them online. Do you have any questions or feedback?

They're great thank you. Please provide 3 more.

You're welcome. Here are three more examples of famous and easy to reproduce experiments in science:

- Extract DNA: This is an experiment that allows you to see the genetic material of living organisms. You can extract DNA from various sources such as strawberries, bananas, kiwis or even your own cheek cells¹. The basic idea is to mash up the source material with some water and salt, add some detergent to break down the cell membranes, filter out the solid bits with a coffee filter or cheesecloth, add some alcohol to precipitate the DNA and use a toothpick or a skewer to spool it out.

- Boyle's air pump: This is an experiment that demonstrates the relationship between pressure and volume of a gas. You can make your own air pump with a syringe, a rubber tube, a balloon and a glass jar³. The basic idea is to attach the syringe to one end of the tube and the balloon to the other end, place the balloon inside the jar and seal it with a lid, pull or push the syringe plunger to change the volume of air inside the tube and observe how it affects the pressure and size of the balloon.

- Baking soda and vinegar reaction: This is an experiment that shows a simple chemical reaction between an acid (vinegar) and a base (baking soda). You can perform this experiment with various materials such as balloons, bottles, rockets or volcanoes⁴. The basic idea is to mix baking soda and vinegar in different proportions and containers and observe how they produce carbon dioxide gas that causes bubbles, fizzing or explosions.

These are three more examples of famous and easy to reproduce experiments in science. I hope they spark your curiosity and creativity. Do you have any questions or feedback?

Excellent thank you! And 3 more. Tey to go whacky. include the Messiner effect.

You're welcome. Here are three more examples of whacky science experiments:

- Meissner effect: This is an experiment that shows how a superconductor can levitate a magnet when it is cooled below a certain temperature. You can try this experiment with a superconducting material such as yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), liquid nitrogen, a neodymium magnet and some safety precautions¹. The basic idea is to cool down the YBCO with liquid nitrogen until it becomes superconducting, place the magnet on top of it and watch it float in mid-air.

- Black snake: This is an experiment that creates a black carbon snake from sugar and baking soda. You can do this experiment with sugar, baking soda, sand, alcohol and a fire source². The basic idea is to mix sugar and baking soda in a small container, cover it with sand, pour some alcohol over it and light it on fire. The sugar and baking soda will react to produce carbon dioxide gas that pushes out the carbon residue in the form of a snake.

- Time crystal: This is an experiment that creates a new state of matter that breaks time symmetry. You can't do this experiment at home as it requires a quantum computer such as Google's Sycamore chip¹. The basic idea is to apply microwave pulses to manipulate qubits (quantum bits) in a specific pattern that causes them to oscillate at twice the frequency of the pulses. This means that the qubits are out of sync with their environment and exhibit periodic behavior without any external energy input.

These are three more examples of whacky science experiments. I hope they fascinate you and make you wonder about the mysteries of nature. Do you have any questions or feedback?

And 3 more

Here are three more examples of whacky science experiments:

- Hologram: This is an experiment that creates a 3D illusion of an object using a smartphone and a CD case. You can do this experiment with a smartphone, a CD case, scissors, tape and some hologram videos⁴. The basic idea is to cut out four trapezoids from the CD case, tape them together to form a pyramid shape, place it upside down on your smartphone screen and play some hologram videos.

- Brazil nut effect: This is an experiment that explains why larger nuts tend to rise to the top of a container when shaken. You can do this experiment with different sizes of nuts or other granular materials such as cereal or candy¹. The basic idea is to fill a transparent container with mixed nuts or other items, shake it vigorously and observe how the larger ones move up while the smaller ones move down.

- Water metal: This is an experiment that transforms water into a shiny golden metal by applying extreme pressure. You can't do this experiment at home as it requires a diamond anvil cell and a laser¹. The basic idea is to squeeze water between two diamonds until it reaches about 5 million times the atmospheric pressure, then zap it with a laser to induce an electronic transition that makes it metallic.

These are three more examples of whacky science experiments. I hope they amaze you and inspire you to learn more about science. Do you have any questions or feedback?

And now the last 3. Go all out. What might someone still do new science and discover something brand new at home or with a reasonably short trip and resonably modest financial resources?

Here are three more examples of science experiments that you can do at home or with a reasonably short trip and modest financial resources:

- DNA extraction: This is an experiment that allows you to see the genetic material of living organisms such as strawberries, bananas or even yourself. You can do this experiment with some fruit, salt, water, dish soap, rubbing alcohol and a coffee filter³. The basic idea is to mash up the fruit, add some salt water and soap to break down the cell walls and membranes, filter out the solid bits and add some alcohol to precipitate the DNA.

- Crystal growing: This is an experiment that lets you grow your own crystals from different substances such as sugar, salt or borax. You can do this experiment with some water, a saucepan, a glass jar, a spoon and your chosen substance³. The basic idea is to heat up some water until it boils, dissolve as much of your substance as possible into it, pour the solution into a jar and let it cool down slowly. You can also add some food coloring or pipe cleaners to make your crystals more colorful or shaped.

- Cloud in a bottle: This is an experiment that demonstrates how clouds form in the atmosphere. You can do this experiment with a clear plastic bottle, some warm water and a match³. The basic idea is to fill the bottle with some warm water, shake it well to create some water vapor inside it, squeeze the bottle hard and release it quickly while lighting a match near its mouth. You should see a cloud appear inside the bottle when you release it.

These are three more examples of science experiments that you can do at home or with a reasonably short trip and modest financial resources. I hope they spark your curiosity and creativity. Do you have any questions or feedback?

That's a great list of experiments you have there!👏

The best experiment for a 12 year old to conduct depends on their interest, skill level, and available resources. Some experiments may be too easy or too hard for them, while others may require special equipment or materials that are not easily accessible.

According to some web sources²⁸, some of the experiments you listed are suitable for older kids (grades 9-12), such as:

- Two-slit experiment
- Cloud chamber
- Meissner effect
- Time crystal

These experiments may involve complex concepts or calculations that are beyond the level of a 12 year old.

Some of the experiments you listed are suitable for younger kids (grades K-4), such as:

- Baking soda and vinegar reaction

These experiments may be too simple or familiar for a 12 year old who is looking for a challenge.

Some of the experiments you listed are suitable for intermediate kids (grades 5-8), such as:

- Brownian motion
- Mendel's pea plant experiment
- Extract DNA
- Boyle's air pump

These experiments may be more engaging and appropriate for a 12 year old who is interested in exploring different aspects of science.

Of course, these are just general guidelines and not definitive rules. You can always modify an experiment to make it more or less difficult depending on your goals and preferences.

What kind of science are you most interested in?🔬
