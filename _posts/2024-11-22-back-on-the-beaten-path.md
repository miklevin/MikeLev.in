This article was almost named **Back On The Beaten Path**, haha! I am happy to
report it only took me 4 paragraphs to course-correct and realize I'm going for
the gold here. This is not about getting back onto the road more traveled but
rather how to inoculate yourself against that kind of thinking, and to continue
driving to the next enabling level the work in which I'm deeply engaged. After
that, all the other stuff that makes me feel time-strapped fall into place. The
idea is to up your game to superhero level as a practical alternative to being
beaten down by life.

Yet, I will keep the way the prior version of the article opened.

I got work to do. And I want to have something to show in inside 1-hour. And so
after days of going off the beaten path to battle the genie into working with me
on creative, novel stuff, it's time to lean into what it does good: exactly
what everybody else commonly does, because that's what it was trained on. I will
not dive down rabbit holes. I will not do explorations or try to learn
anything. I will travel footprint by footprint in others' steps, and I will ask
ChatGPT 4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and sometimes Gemini-Advanced Pro how people do
this like all the time.

So, the #1 rule is avoid ambition. It's not about doing something new or most
useful. It is about doing something exactly like what someone else has done
before, which the LLMs have trained on copiously and have really strong best
practice opinions about. Follow the crowd and use the common wisdom!

Take these URLs and put them in a df and prepare to do additional steps with it
on follow-up prompts. Ignore the stuff in parenthesis. Only the URLs are the
data... yadda, yadda. Wow, the sweet spot here is ChatGPT's ability to execute
Python on its own and bounce back and forth with itself analyzing as it
encounters errors and fixes them. Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Cursor AI isn't even
doing that. I know it's old news, but it's still very impressive that ChatGPT
has its own Python code execution environments where it really runs Pandas and
really generates CSVs so it can do the work on its end and just give you
download links. Yup, that's leaning into the path more travelled, for sure.

But NO! Back on the beaten path means beaten down. And I finished what I needed
for that meeting, and It's only an hour long and it's only a half hour away. And
once that's done the rest of the day opens up, and that's 3 solid days of focus
time before the daily grind kicks back in. I can change the world in a
time-window like that, especially considering what I'm on the verge of here.

You plan your projects for progressive enablement. 

Each project enables the next, previously unachievable project.

Thinking of them as projects is unproductive. They are mere day-by-day,
moment-by-moment chisel strikes on a sculpture that is always a work-in-progress
and is always complete.
