So many people are enamored with ChatGPT teaching them how to code. You'll hear
the term "game changer" over and over. The funny thing is that we as human
beings have always had the autonomy to do research and figure out how to do a
thing, exactly as many of us have with Google. Easy peasy web research was the
game changer.

So it's ironic that today a system that lacks autonomy is helping people find
theirs. Keyword and phrase searches that return matching resources isn't
enough. It's got to perform the research and cleverly rework stuff that it's
found into a canned answer. And it's sad that people have not had a human
presence in their lives that could teach them how to learn for themselves what
ChatGPT serves up on a silver platter.

Tapping a teacher for an answer is something you do when you can't figure
things out for yourself. Copy/pasting code out of ChatGPT is only marginally
better than copying from Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow. You can get the
magic words and do a lot of hand waving to prove to people you're smart like
the AI/Teacher who answered your questions, but the deeper learnings of having
struggled through it for yourself are denied.

There could be no better time for me to be relaunching project Pipulate. To
Pipulate is putting it all together into a working and automatable system.
ChatGPT isn't going to be able to do that for you. If you're hosting something
for somebody else, host it somewhere off-site. But if you're doing the work for
just yourself, keep your code at home and don't pay for cloud services until
you really have to.

GitHub is the exception today, and I'm leaning heavily on it for keeping my
repositories, but that won't last long. Breaking my GitHub dependency is high
on my list of what Pipulate should evolve into. Pipulate at home will best be
served as something that can host LXD Linux containers, plus 2 levels of file
backupâ€”plus the original on mirrored drives, so your data in no less than 3
@home locations.

As you do stream of consciousness writing like this, stay aware of meandering
too far away from the goal of the writing. Sometimes we use this sort of
writing to direct ourselves. This is the assertion of autonomy. We are
channeling from places unknown and are able to examine our awareness and
interrupt our flow. I should challenge ChatGPT to my current challenges. That
can be a great trick to spur me on, perchance improve the quality-level of my
work incorporating in anything ChatGPT's seen that I haven't.

I could really run with that. If you've been feeling like an imposter for a
long time anyway, and along comes ChatGPT to beat you at your game easily, then
it might be be time to do some soul searching. Writing is a soft skill. Writing
code out of context of it actually running is a soft skill. Making a system you
can use every day is a hard skill.

How long before you can talk an AI through the Browser-based web scraps
automation you plan to do? Won't it be able to do anything you can do as a
human with a mouse and keyboard? Of course it will, and plenty of
user-simulating "bots" already exist today. It's just not a convenient easily
accessible capability today. It takes some coding expertise.

There's a lot of time between now and when an AI will adjust your Linux daemon
scheduled tasks and server configuration at home without overlord cloud
assistance. But we'll get there, and between here and that vision is Pipulate.
Eventually, all the Python code in Jupyter to Linux daemon conversion should be
conversationally based. You talk code into existence in Jupyter (without paying
cloud services). There's an unlikely but potentially popular and soul-cleansing
path here. Articulate it and promote it.
