I like to make sure by blog publishing system is still working. Finally
watching The Shawshank Redemption again... again being probably for the second
time after the first time somewhere in my mid-twenties. Somewhere in my
mid-twenties, things went strange. Both my parents checked out. First my dad on
college graduation, same week if I recall correctly. Years later, my mom
started going crazy and disappearing on and off until done. These days I spend
the weekends with my kid, my child from my first marriage. I'm on my second but
that's another story. For now, it's me and the kid.

Me and the kid. I have to do well at work to continue earning well. Somehow
through this SEO-route of mine, I ended up in an area of the
information-technology industry where I pull and prepare data for stakeholders.
That's what I do, I guess. It's based on the simple principle that without
being a professional programmer "on-the-hook" for your creations, you can do
what basically amounts to one-off data-pull projects. This is because it's not
needed or because of some labor-intensive step is unreasonable to deliver
regularly.

Life is funny. Are you on your own or are you not? Are you ever really not on
your own in some way? Having cats is interesting too. It's probably the one
thing now besides wanting to be stable for my kid keeping me from going all RV.
Why pay rent? Why not take it on the road? Only the cats. The child on weekends
and the cats. I could go RV sometime soon. It seems likely in my future. I
wonder how that would be with cats? Persistence. Purrsistence.
