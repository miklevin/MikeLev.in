Ugh, okay... I reworked my lxdwin repo into drinkme. I had to take the concept
of LXD out of the repo name because it's not always about LXD anymore, although
I do want to get back to it. The urgency of day-to-day work has overridden my
desire to be on a better container API than WSL.

It's time to actually use the stuff I built. I have to avoid distraction at all
costs. I have such a big data-pull project for work that landed in my lap. Ugh!
Okay, 1, 2, 3... 1? Strong nickname! I have a repo folder that's already a good
candidate for WHERE it belongs.

Oh! Start that repo for everyone so that I can take mlseo and ohawf out of
drinkme. Let everyone follow along from scratch!

Yes! It's video-time.
