How can I publish in order to teach people this in such a way is it is sure to go viral. keep in mind the target audience of folks who can do incredible technical things in Excel and Google Sheets but have not taken that next step onto Pytnon on Linux even though they can now by running JuputerLab unde Linux under Windows now with WSL and magic install scripts. They can start using Python on a real Linux server and take the first major step to real 24x7 automation without having dependencies on cloud platforms or proprietary systems. Make that argument for an audience of people who are right on the edge of taking that step and tell me where to use the message.

Thank you for your question. Based on my web searches, some of the tips to create viral content are:

- Use sleek visuals to increase audience engagementÂ¹. You can use tools like Visme or Canva to create eye-catching graphics, videos or infographics that illustrate your message and attract attention.
- Create interactive and personalized contentÂ¹. You can use tools like Typeform or SurveyMonkey to create quizzes, polls or surveys that invite your audience to participate and share their opinions or results.
- Produce well-researched longform contentÂ¹. You can use tools like Google Scholar or Medium to find credible sources and write in-depth articles that provide valuable information and insights on your topic.
- Evoke high-arousal emotionsÂ¹. You can use techniques like storytelling, humor or controversy to elicit strong emotions such as awe, laughter, anger or curiosity in your audience. Emotions can motivate people to share your content with others who might feel the same way.
- Know your audience wellÂ¹. You can use tools like Google Analytics or Facebook Insights to analyze your audience's demographics, preferences and behavior. This can help you tailor your content to their needs, interests and pain points.

To reach an audience of people who are proficient in Excel and Google Sheets but have not taken the next step into Python on Linux, you might want to:

- Highlight the benefits of using Python on Linux for automation, such as speed, flexibility and cost-effectiveness. You can use examples or case studies of successful projects that used Python on Linux for automation.
- Address the challenges or barriers that might prevent them from learning Python on Linux, such as lack of time, resources or confidence. You can offer solutions or tips on how to overcome these obstacles, such as online courses, tutorials or communities that can help them learn at their own pace and level.
- Create a sense of urgency or FOMO (fear of missing out) by showing them how they might fall behind their competitors or miss out on opportunities if they don't learn Python on Linux. You can use statistics or trends that show how Python on Linux is becoming more popular and demanded in the job market.

Some of the platforms where you can publish your content are:

- LinkedIn: This is a professional network where you can reach potential employers, clients or collaborators who might be interested in your topic. You can post articles, videos or slideshows on LinkedIn Pulse and join relevant groups where you can share your content and engage with other members.
- YouTube: This is a video-sharing platform where you can reach a large and diverse audience who might prefer watching rather than reading your content. You can create videos that explain, demonstrate or entertain your audience with your topic. You can also optimize your videos with keywords, tags and descriptions that help them rank higher in search results.
- Reddit: This is a social news platform where you can reach a niche and active audience who might be passionate about your topic. You can post links, images or text posts on subreddits that are related to your topic and participate in discussions with other users.

I hope this helps. Do you have any follow-up questions? ðŸ˜Š
