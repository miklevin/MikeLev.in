title: Jekyll include tags for Github.io YouTube Embedding
headline: Developing Habits to Become an Expert in Technical Moves and Live-Streaming
description: I'm developing new habits to become an expert in technical moves and live-streaming. To make sure nothing proprietary is shared, I'm setting up hotkeys and testing embedding YouTube videos in my Github.io pages. I'm also creating mikelevinseo.com as a place to write about topics instead of my main journal. Click through to read more about my journey.

Get really good at the technical moves. When you're ready to publish things
publicly, you have several options.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="8bM6EGpAS5w" %}

I need to develop some new habits to compel me forward, daily. Switch this over
to public casting! When getting ready to broadcast publicly, I have to be very
careful about this screen #1. I don't want anything proprietary displayed. So I
need a little ritual when getting ready to live-stream.

I feel confused and have to get rid of that confusion. Not merely get rid of
it, but knowing what's important and why, and achieve a bit of clarity,
motivation, and forward-movement in life.

The streaming preparation that I do also applies to my entire system, like
anything in my browser. So... gotta achieve clarity. What do I do? Well, as
always:

    1, 2, 3... 1?

- Organize the todo lists across "sites".
- Expose this very screen as it shows right now on next video.
- Do a commitment and consistency livestream on mikelevinseo.com
- Lay out your 1, 2, 3 plan for that site and seoml repo (where you left off)

I set up hotkeys to start streaming and stop streaming. Do a new test...

Hello World! I'm doing some new tests. Of course first is the transparent
webcam headshot, an OBS feature. Next, I want really to have better looking
YouTube embeds on my Github.io pages. You can't see it but I also used a
keyboard shortcut to get OBS itself out of the video and once I have confidence
I'll get this page... out as well.

Okay, so the embed...

That will take a moment to complete. Meanwhile I should set up that site,
mikelevinseo.com, the way I did mikeateleven.com, meaning having it as the
place where I really start writing about topics instead of my main journal
(here) from which I would have to copy/paste all the time to publish it.

Okay, that's done! Wow, I'll update the ones on the other site...

That's "before" and that's after.

Okay, done. Onto main work!
