alright, time to think through next steps and make a career of this. i hate to
think it starts with yet another registered domain, but it might. as a
reminder, here's the [tld list from
icann](https://data.iana.org/tld/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt)

okay, i registered mykoz.ai and got the mykoz_ai twitter handle. go grab up
this handle at all other relevant social medias:

- domain: mykoz.ai
- tiktok: mykoz_ai
- twitch: mykoz_ai
- github: mykoz-ai
- discord: mykoz_ai
- twitter: mykoz_ai
- patreon: mykoz.ai
- instagram: mykoz_ai
- youtube: mykoz.live
- mastodon: mykoz (and mykoz_ai)
- facebook: mykoz (community under mikelevinux)
- mailchimp: mykoz but requires physical address! earmark for later. focus on
  the social media following.

everybody i want to reach with such an endeavor at least has one of the
following: twitter, facebook, youtube, discord, instagram, mastodon or tiktok.
i can allow my following to just follow me on these social media platforms, and
then i can forego the whole pushing out email thing for now. it's better form
anyway. think! this has the 80/20-rule covered. don't spread yourself around
too much. but if this is becoming your main thing, then you can make an attempt
to be present on and repurpose your content for each of these platforms.

can this be kickstarted? give that thought. make this kickstarter friendly as
you go. what could you even offer folks different from the install script that
will be available to everyone? can their be tiers? how can i build in paid
membership following? and can i do it on multiple platforms? i'll have to think
that through. i signed up for patreon just in case, but a lot of these
platforms have paid membership now too. 

so one of the key questions will be whether i'll manage things through one
payment method or let people just subscribe to me wherever they like and i
manage access to benefits on the back end? yeah, probably that. let them
subscribe where they like and let me get the monetization experience on all
platforms. i'm replacing (enhancing) seo in my heart and soul, and this
monetization gig is such a central part. hop on that bandwagon!

i've got so much to offer.

okay, all the branding has changed to mykoz.ai instead of mykoz: areal/os

what about mykoz.ai: areal/os?

oh, it looks good in figlet:

```
 __  __       _  __             _    ___ 
|  \/  |_   _| |/ /___ ____    / \  |_ _|
| |\/| | | | | ' // _ \_  /   / _ \  | | 
| |  | | |_| | . \ (_) / / _ / ___ \ | | 
|_|  |_|\__, |_|\_\___/___(_)_/   \_\___|
        |___/                            
```

this has some big memetic potential. rework the banner.

okay, the colon can stay. but what's the built-in tagline of the banner?

```
 __  __       _  __             _    ___   
|  \/  |_   _| |/ /___ ____    / \  |_ _|_ 
| |\/| | | | | ' // _ \_  /   / _ \  | |(_)
| |  | | |_| | . \ (_) / / _ / ___ \ | | _ 
|_|  |_|\__, |_|\_\___/___(_)_/   \_\___(_)
        |___/                              
```

still "areal/os"?

```
 __  __       _  __             _    ___        _    ____            _    _____  ____  
|  \/  |_   _| |/ /___ ____    / \  |_ _|_     / \  |  _ \ ___  __ _| |  / / _ \/ ___| 
| |\/| | | | | ' // _ \_  /   / _ \  | |(_)   / _ \ | |_) / _ \/ _` | | / / | | \___ \ 
| |  | | |_| | . \ (_) / / _ / ___ \ | | _   / ___ \|  _ <  __/ (_| | |/ /| |_| |___) |
|_|  |_|\__, |_|\_\___/___(_)_/   \_\___(_) /_/   \_\_| \_\___|\__,_|_/_/  \___/|____/ 
        |___/                                                                          
```

87 characters long. also just too much information. how do we hit home the
essential meaning?

```
 __  __       _  __             _    ___   
|  \/  |_   _| |/ /___ ____    / \  |_ _|_   resist planned obsolescence
| |\/| | | | | ' // _ \_  /   / _ \  | |(_)  by mastering timeless free &
| |  | | |_| | . \ (_) / / _ / ___ \ | | _   open source software on linux
|_|  |_|\__, |_|\_\___/___(_)_/   \_\___(_)  you can tow around forever.
        |___/                              
```

hmm, this throws off the whole marcus aurelius connection.

maybe i can get the best of both worlds. 

```
 __  __       _  __             _    ___    ____            _    _____  ____  
|  \/  |_   _| |/ /___ ____    / \  |_ _|  |  _ \ ___  __ _| |  / / _ \/ ___| 
| |\/| | | | | ' // _ \_  /   / _ \  | |   | |_) / _ \/ _` | | / / | | \___ \ 
| |  | | |_| | . \ (_) / / _ / ___ \ | |   |  _ <  __/ (_| | |/ /| |_| |___) |
|_|  |_|\__, |_|\_\___/___(_)_/   \_\___|  |_| \_\___|\__,_|_/_/  \___/|____/ 
        |___/                                                                          
```

wow! that ends at a very safe 78 characters, haha! this is too good to not
share publicly, giving the insight to the creative process. i mean, who does
figlet first?

so to recap...

it's mykoz, because it's "my cause".

it's my koz, because i'm mike and i love the oz connection, just 'cause.

it's mykoz.ai real/os because linux is a "real" (not-consumer) os that won't
let you down for life the way consumer os's do.

it's mykoz.ai real/os because marcus aurelius' stoicism and connection to the
tow-it-ism concept i'm tying to this.

it's mykoz.ai because i got the exact domain name.

it's mykoz.ai because i can get the mykoz_ai username on most major platforms,
push this out sooner rather than later. let folks follow the evolution of this
project. maybe on the mykoz.ai domain!

let's create one of those ascii art banners with figlet and massage the
messaging to something as viral and mememtic and to the point as possible.

```
 __  __       _  __             _    ___    ____            _    _____  ____  
|  \/  |_   _| |/ /___ ____    / \  |_ _|  |  _ \ ___  __ _| |  / / _ \/ ___| 
| |\/| | | | | ' // _ \_  /   / _ \  | |   | |_) / _ \/ _` | | / / | | \___ \ 
| |  | | |_| | . \ (_) / / _ / ___ \ | |   |  _ <  __/ (_| | |/ /| |_| |___) |
|_|  |_|\__, |_|\_\___/___(_)_/   \_\___|  |_| \_\___|\__,_|_/_/  \___/|____/ 
        |___/ mykoz.ai real/os tow-it-ism: small portable lifelong linux tech

- it's much simpler to transition your tech skills onto linux than you think.
- the benefit increases every time everyone else gets set back by disruption.
- regardless of planned obsolescence, fundamental tech underpinnings persist.
- let us take you from python in jupyterlab to linux services in one sitting.

```

wow. i think i'm really nailing it.
