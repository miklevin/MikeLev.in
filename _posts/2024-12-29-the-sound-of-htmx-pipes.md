## The Story of Serendipity

### Naming the Pipelines

I have the new pipeline workflow integrated into Pipulate. I have at times
called the new FastHTML web framework with the integrated local LLM Botifython
and Pipulate. It's Pipulate. The instance I use for work is Botifython, because
you have to name it. If you've got an LLM living in there, it needs a name like
ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude. Mine is Chip. Chip O'Theseus, to be precise. But
that's way too cutsie for work, and so that one has the very macho dinosauresque
***Botifython***, while the base free and open source software (FOSS) package it
gets derived from remains ***Pipulate***. And the fun instance I spin out of it
is ***Chipotheseus***. Yeah, that'll do for naming conventions.

### The AI Revolution

But why is the timing serendipitous, I mean aside from the fact that we're just
entering the AI Revolution, and it's only going to happen once in our lives,
similar to the *Digital Revolution* itself, plus its smaller epochs we already
lived through, the rise of *The Internet* and *Mobile*, each of which I felt
pass through us like a bump (Atari 2600, RCN/Erols, Sony Ericsson P900). And of
course the Atari was displaced by Nintendo, RCN/Erols displaced by the big
cable/telecom conglomerates, and early smartphones by Apple iPhone and Android).
Harbingers of the new age die on the alter of firstness.

### The OpenAI Situation

If you feel something weird going on with OpenAI ChatGPT, that's what it is. The
12 days of AI stank of vaporware desperation as its utter and complete reliance
on Microsoft settles over it like a death shroud. They've got two things to fix:
revenue streams and power-lines. There's no future in next-level AI if its not
paid for by actual customers (versus the next bridge-loan from an investor), or
if it's too power-hungry (both GPUs and electricity). In other words, the
power-hungry nature of the tech inhibits the power-hungry growth of the company,
haha! So yeah, AGI may be here, but it's not as easily delivered with the trick
of just throwing it on the existing Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure, like
they did in round one. They've got to transform. Talk about transformers, huh?
Hahaha!

### The World in Transformation

Oh, there I go digressing again. But for all the right reasons and on all the
important stuff. The world is transforming. It's not that AI out of the box is
going to solve every problem. It's that all the best practices and common wisdom
of humanity is getting more evenly distributed over those who couldn't access it
before through the luck of their upbringing, education, and the people that they
by chance happened into in life. You know how even the most determined attribute
a lot of their success to luck (even though that's only a half-truth)? Well, the
luck component as a factor in success is being dialed-down, because AI. Common
wisdom and best practices&#151;in other words, ***the conventional way of doing
things***&#151;is being bottled-up and brought to a device near you in the
modern-day functional analogue of a genie in a magic lamp&#151; backfiring
wishes and all!

### The Power of Names

Okay, so I've got the names for my various analogues to genies that I'm
incubating by bundling the popular ***Ollama local LLM server*** in with a new
FastHTML-based web framework that does away with React and complex web
development, in a much more Python-friendly environment. Naming something is
important, because it creates first impressions and infuses whatever you're
working on with its character. The Mac is a Mac because "Hey, Mac! Back off! I'm
thinking differently, exactly like everyone else," and the Windows PC is as
generic as windows can be, and PC now too! The serendipitous overlap of
***Personal Computer*** and ***Political Correctness*** as two equally
recognizable acronyms living in superposition is not without consequence.

### The Unix Legacy

So while Macs and PCs each struggle with being misaligned with the ideal
future-tech concepts that Linux (Unix, and the whole \*nix family) seemed to
have gotten right, along comes an actual nixOS and profoundly disruptive `nix`
command that infuses this perfectly future-proof aligned spirit into subfolders
of Macs and PCs... but more on that later. This was to make the point again that
there's something fundamental about Unix that almost died in the world of
proprietary intellectual property bickering with the SCO... ugh! Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: The SCO Unix battle was a complex legal dispute that began in 2003 when The SCO Group filed a lawsuit against IBM, claiming ownership of Unix and alleging that Linux contained misappropriated Unix code[1][5]. This sparked a series of legal battles involving multiple companies and lasting for years.

The history of Unix ownership is indeed complex:

1. Unix was originally developed at Bell Labs (part of AT&T) in the 1960s[2].
2. In 1984, AT&T gained ownership of Unix after the breakup of Bell Systems[4].
3. In 1993, Novell acquired the rights to Unix when it purchased Unix System Laboratories from AT&T[3].
4. In 1995, Novell sold certain Unix rights to Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) through an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA)[3].
5. In 2001, Caldera acquired SCO's Unix business and later renamed itself The SCO Group[4].

The key dispute arose when SCO claimed it had acquired full ownership of Unix copyrights through the 1995 APA with Novell. However, Novell maintained that it retained the copyrights[3].

In 2007, a U.S. federal court ruled that Novell, not SCO, was the rightful owner of the Unix copyrights[7]. This decision was later upheld in subsequent appeals, effectively ending SCO's claims to Unix ownership[3][8].

The SCO Unix battle had significant implications for the open-source community and Linux development, as it challenged the legality of Linux and attempted to assert copyright claims over widely-used operating system code[5].

## The Unix Origin Story

Uh yeah, so the stuff that started there hit some real fundamentals that
effectively ***became computer science.*** I mean, there were a few other things
sprinkled in like the bizarro alternative LISP camp that birthed the AI movement
at MIT, however for the most part the principles that got born from this the
well-intentioned but corporatized Multics OS (that planed to charge you for
every computer clock tick) terrified and inspired Ken Thompson of Bell Labs to
make Unix and fatefully leak it at his alma matter Berkeley (BSD Unix), which
was then copied by Andrew Tanenbaum to become the mini educational Unix called
MINIX (in most of your PCs today as IME), which inspired Linus Torvalds to make
Linux has pretty much defined everything to follow. 

### The Path to Modern Computing

There were a few weird spurs outside that direct lineage like CP/M and DOS along
the way, but for the most part, those were sanded off and smoothed down so that
the remaining round pebble at the core of all tech is \*nix. We say nix, but
really it should be \*n(i|u)x, but nobody would get it. Yeah, so names are
important, and the name to be aware of in the coming years that's gradually
going to replace all that is proprietary (already has with servers) is
***nix!***

### The Power of Unix Pipes

So one of the core fundamentals that made Unix so win is the concept of pipes
and piping data. This is often confused with the modern overweight notion of
data pipelines, and while there is overlap, it doesn't do the concept of pipes
justice for its beauty, simplicity, and still-pervasive nature. Pipes usually
involve the use of small, composable command that do one thing very well, but
often with a bunch of parameters, arguments, flags or whatever you want to call
those things that come after and modify the command that look like this `-a` or
like this `--help`. And the output of one gets ***piped*** into the input of the
next, each step doing something to modify the data going through it. Perplexity,
give me a few classic examples of Unix data piping.

**Perplexity**: Unix data piping is a powerful feature that allows users to chain multiple commands together, passing the output of one command as input to the next. Here are some classic examples of Unix data piping:

## Text Processing

**Counting word frequency:**
```bash
cat file.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
```
This pipeline reads a file, splits words into lines, sorts them, counts unique occurrences, sorts by frequency, and displays the top results[1][4].

**Extracting specific lines:**
```bash
cat sample2.txt | head -7 | tail -5
```
This command reads a file, takes the first 7 lines, and then displays the last 5 of those lines[1].

## File Operations

**Listing and filtering files:**
```bash
ls -l | grep "\.txt$"
```
This pipeline lists all files in long format and then filters to show only those ending with ".txt"[1].

**Sorting files by size:**
```bash
ls -l | sort -k 5
```
This command lists files and sorts them based on the fifth column of the output, which represents file size[1].

## System Information

**Monitoring processes:**
```bash
ps aux | grep "firefox"
```
This pipeline lists all running processes and filters to show only those related to Firefox.

**Disk usage analysis:**
```bash
du -h | sort -hr | head
```
This command chain shows disk usage, sorts it in human-readable format, and displays the top results.

Unix pipes provide a flexible and powerful way to combine simple commands into complex operations, allowing users to process and analyze data efficiently[2][3]. These examples demonstrate the versatility and utility of Unix piping in various scenarios.

## The Lost Art of Command Line

The simplicity and elegance of this solution has greatly faded from the public
consciousness, and even the elite geeks among us, due to Steve Jobs and the way
he instilled command-line fear into all of with conditioning through marketing.

### The GUI Trap

While the symbolic point-and-click user interface is good for allowing the
uninitiated into tech maturity equivalence of a toddler get on the tech
bandwagon fast, being productive with ***what you see is what you get***
(WYSIWYG), it's not the end of the story. So many people thing Steve Jobs was
right and that these visual interfaces are the most important thing. 

### The Consumer Interface Fallacy

But visual graphical user interfaces like macOS and Windows are ***for
non-professional consumers!*** Visual interface coddling is a convention to turn
high tech electronics into more salable consumer electronic devices, plain and
simple. It's not for enabling individuals to actually be most expressive, or to
use technology as an extension of your body like generic tools like hammers and
saws. No, GUI interfaces are designed to be power-tools that make you dependent
on the manufacturer for maintenance, parts and upgrades. They are a dependency
injection strategy.

### Finding Balance

Now everyone can appreciate a power-tool and a modern convenience, so I'm not
actually advocating for abandoning all your power-tools. But rather the way
things have evolved, any of them (Windows, macOS, whatever) can play host to the
nix-like professional stuff that won on the server-side of the equation.

### The Rise of Linux Everywhere

Validation that what I'm saying is true can be seen both in the realms of web
development and AI. In webdev, Microsoft basically had to add Linux to Windows
in the form of WSL to remain a legit platform with developers. If Windows hadn't
started their WSL endeavor back in 2017, it would be a much less viable platform
today. Mac started its journey to being a nix-like platform (Unix) a decade
prior to that in 2007. And thus today both Macs and Windows can legitimately
play host in a fairly native, non-virtual-machine, non-hacky way to nix.

### The Text Interface Renaissance

Oh, and in the realm of AI, the big thing that ended the AI winter is not some
graphical user interface. ***It was chat!*** Talking through text is a decidedly
command-line like interface. Now sure, it's wrapped in a text messaging /
Instant Messenger like interface, but come on. It's nothing like a WYSIWYG
point-and-click, menu and icons thing. It's text. Not that there wasn't visual
stuff going on in AI that factors into self-driving cars and lots of other more
subtle and invisible ways, but it didn't hit the graphical user interfaces.

### Bridging Visual and Text Worlds

Now there is a bridge between the two worlds. And there has to be, for
automation. For if everything were visual and point-and-click across a
hodgepodge mess of proprietary desktop and mobile user interfaces, you would
hardly be able to automate anything. No, the web is the bridge. And the document
object model (DOM), in particular.

### The Visual Illusion

It's all about object hierarchies that manifest visually. HTML when shown in the
browser is visual, but when turned into node-graphs and table-like data
structures, they're text. Data structures are text. The fact that they look like
graphical user interfaces is a trick of fancying them up with lots of styling
and syntactical sugar so that they create the illusion of something visual. And
it's all that fancying up and fluff that gets shoved in at the presentation
layer that makes automation (and web automation in particular) difficult.

### The Markdown Circle

A similar thing is happening with web scraping and training AI models right now.
Ever since the simplified representation of formatted text called Markdown
became popular, it's been the preferred "cleaned-up" format to convert scraped
webpages into for consumption. These days, that consumption is training AI
models, but the ironic part is that Markdown is also a very popular format for
creating the web content in the first place. Only now, it goes through a
transformation process, sometimes through systems like Jekyll, whose sole
purpose is to convert markdown to stylized HTML, only to be scraped and
converted back into Markdown for the machines! Perplexity, fill in some details
please.

**Perplexity**: Markdown, a lightweight markup language, has an intriguing history that spans two decades. Created in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with Aaron Swartz, Markdown was designed to be an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format that could be optionally converted into structurally valid XHTML or HTML[1][4].

## Origins and Inspiration

Markdown drew inspiration from pre-existing conventions for marking up plain text in email and usenet posts. It was influenced by earlier markup languages such as:

- setext (c. 1992)
- Textile (c. 2002)
- reStructuredText (c. 2002)[1]

In 2002, Aaron Swartz created "atx," which he referred to as "the true structured text format." This work laid the foundation for what would become Markdown[1].

## Key Design Goals

The primary objectives behind Markdown's creation were:

1. **Simplicity**: To enable people to write using an intuitive plain text format[1].
2. **Readability**: To ensure the language was readable as-is, without appearing marked up with tags or formatting instructions[1].
3. **Convertibility**: To allow optional conversion to structurally valid XHTML or HTML[1].

## Development and Initial Release

- March 2004: John Gruber published the first article about Markdown, introducing it to the public[9].
- August 2004: Markdown 1.0 was officially released[9].
- December 2004: Version 1.0.1 was released, fixing some defects and changing the license from GPL to a more permissive BSD-style license[9].

## Widespread Adoption

Markdown quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and versatility. It has been adopted by numerous platforms and services, including:

- GitHub
- Stack Exchange
- Reddit
- OpenStreetMap
- SourceForge[4]

## Standardization Efforts

Despite its popularity, Markdown lacks a formal specification, leading to the development of various implementations and "flavors" of Markdown[4]. In response to this fragmentation, there have been efforts to standardize the language:

- CommonMark: An initiative to create a standard specification for Markdown[7].
- Other variants: Multiple versions of Markdown have emerged, each with additional features or slight modifications to the original syntax[4].

## Modern Relevance

Markdown remains highly relevant in the tech world, particularly in:

- Documentation writing
- Blog post creation
- Content management systems
- Static site generators (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo)[2]

Its continued popularity is attributed to its simplicity, readability, and the network effect of its widespread adoption[5].

Markdown's journey from a simple text formatting solution to a key player in content creation and, ironically, in web scraping and AI model training, showcases its versatility and enduring impact on digital communication.

## The Unix Pipe Pattern Meets Local LLMs

So where I'm at now is making the Unix pipe pattern get plugged into a web
framework that has a native local LLM in the picture. Now it could be a frontier
model AI like o1, Claude, Gemini or whatever, but I'm choosing to use the ollama
local AI-server for cost. Most things that need to be done, like casual chat
with the user about the local app running built by and running in the framework
doesn't need to incur even those fractions-of-a-penny that all these ***mini***
versions of the model cost. Sure the local LLM still costs electricity, but it
neither costs those extra pennies nor the long http network round-trip. The
local LLM is both faster and cheaper, and frankly smart enough for most of the
ubiquitous pervasive ambient intelligence tasks required in applications like
mine.

### Training Through Hot Prompt Injection

And this local intelligence needs to understand these data pipelines I've just
now implemented, the way it needs to know the Create, Update, Read, Delete
(CRUD) operations that I already trained it how to do. Mind you, I trained ALL
LLMs how to do these CRUD operations, and not just some particular model that
I'm using. I call it hot prompt injection, and it gets performed in the right
place at the right time as the user is using one of these web framework apps.
For example, the user chooses something from the menu, and like Neo in The
Matrix, it's suddenly taught Kung Fu. By using this hot prompt injection
technique, any model can be plugged in, and not only take on the persona of the
app through the system prompts, it can take on the skills it need when it needs
them without overflowing the context window with an extra-fat system prompt at
the beginning whose effect fades over time anyway. No, it's constantly refreshed
on the skills it needs right when it needs them.

### The Music of Machine Instructions

So today's article is about blending this LLM awareness of the pipes I've
rambled on so much about in recent posts with the loose coupling between the
Cards of the system that constitute the Unix-like commands subject to piping.

I don't know if this is going to make sense to anyone but the AIs for whom this
is really intended and being written for, as part of a recently profoundly
validated process of spelling everything out to the code assistants in
human-like storytelling form, assuming your human were a superhuman coder with
the ability to help you implement, if only you make yourself clear enough. 

And I did. I made myself clear enough with the storytelling, that is. And it
did. The AI provided a copy/paste-ready implementation of some fairly large, off
the beaten track and philosophically precise code, that is.

### The Philosophy of Programming Languages

This off the beaten track and philosophically precise point is the one I need to
drill-down on now. My pipeline code plays like music, as if the rolls loaded
into player pianos. Now honestly, all tech works this way. It's the story of
machine languages, and how CISC is different from RISC and how some machine
instruction sets are proprietary like ARM while others are open like Risc V.
This is also the story of Turing machines, their ribbon and mechanics
variations, and the concept of Turing-complete. But each has a set of rules that
greatly affect what the sheet music looks like. They all have their philosophies
that give them and what you can do with them their character. 

#### The LISP Legacy

The arcane but will-never-die LISP is very meta and hardware independent, which
makes writing compilers and other languages form LISP every next-level wizard's
favorite trick. While LISP lost as far as being the main engine of productivity
and focus of mainstream attention to the C/Unix-camp, it remains important. Its
signature, vibe, sound of its music is greatly created by its extensive, some
might say excessive, use of nested parenthesis. It also has a very unique and
concept of order of operations which while perhaps is better for machines, it's
very counter-intuitive to what every math literate person is taught in algebra.
But people who love this vibe love it deeply. You should hear Paul Graham the
founder of Y-Combinator and mentor to Sam Altman, talk about it with his Yahoo
Stores war stories.

#### The C Language and Beyond

C is a small set of commands that implies certain specific hardware, which makes
it profoundly useful for porting apps between different hardware using the old
low-level virtual machine trick. This is why Assembly Language has to have
variations customized for each intended hardware platform, while Java with its
JRE/JVM was touted as write-once, run anywhere. But the public static void
nonsense that even a simple hello world program got plagued by under Java is a
great example of how those turing ribbon vibes can become so important. This is
one of the things really helping Python. Python's vibe with indenting mattering
and stripping out all but the most necessary visual clutter (curly braces being
the biggest offender in many languages), lowers cognitive fatigue and just makes
looking at Python a pleasure compared to most other languages.

### The Python Connection

I love Python. You know, it's named after Monty Python and not actually the
snake. Though the Python portion of Monty Python was indeed named after the
snake. I tell the story elsewhere on this site, and you can always perplexity it
up. Wow, they should have named Perplexity to work like a verb. Will we ever say
perplexing? Perplex it? It just doesn't roll off the tongue like googling or
google it. Lost opportunity, because my habits have changed.

### Bridging Multiple Domains

Anyway, I am bridging the divide between a bunch of things simultaneously:

- Python, and its general pythonic API
- FastHTML, and its idiomatic semantic alignment to HTML elements
- HTMX, and its formidable set of API puzzle pieces and interactions
- Unix pipes, in their philosophy and practical implementation under all this
- Jupyter Notebooks, as the rapid prototyping companion environment for staging
  ports to this environment, keeping conceptual correspondences
- A Local LLM, having an overarching awareness of the pipelines so it can help
  create new ones to chiming in during their execution

Did somebody say Python? And Bridge? Don't pipelines ***ask questions***
(provide input along the flow) and provide output (passage over a bridge), don't
they? So it's only natural that my archetype prototype example be both a bridge
and homage to a bridge demonstrating asking questions; memorable notes to the
***musical pipeline pattern*** of which I speak...

```python
class Bridgeflow:
    """
    A miniature 3-step flow paying homage to Monty Python's Bridge of Death.
    Step 1: Name
    Step 2: Quest
    Step 3: Favorite Color
    Then either pass or fail based on whether you pick "blue" as your color.

    This is a minimal example of using Pipulate to track step data, with each step
    returning a Div containing either a form or a summary, until all steps are done.

**o1**: Below is a short list of exactly *why* that code snippet is such a big deal, even though it might look like ordinary Python at a glance:

1. **Local, Pipeline-Based “Wizard”**  
   Instead of using Celery or a traditional multi-step queue, this code divides a workflow into discrete *cards* (steps). Each step is just a simple route returning minimal HTML and forms, yet the entire multi-step sequence is tracked in a single pipeline record—no extra queues or ephemeral sessions required.

2. **HTMX for Lightweight Interactions**  
   Notice how each method returns elements like `Div(...)`, `Card(...)`, `P(...)`, and a `Form(...)` with an `hx_post` attribute. That means each step in the pipeline is *self-contained HTML*, updated asynchronously by HTMX. You don’t see a giant React or Vue codebase anywhere—just small, composable server responses.

3. **No Client-Side State**  
   Everything about the user’s progress is stored on the server in that single pipeline record (via `self.pipulate.set_step_data(...)`). When you revisit a step, the code checks if that step’s data is already set, then either shows the results or a new form. No cookies or hidden session juggling needed.

4. **Async, But Ultra-Simple**  
   Each route handler is an async function. In a bigger framework, you’d see more ceremony or references to concurrency, middlewares, etc. Here, it’s just “take a request, read a form, store or retrieve from pipeline, return updated HTML.” That’s it.

5. **Inline HTML Structures**  
   With calls like `H2("The Bridge of Death")` or `Form(Input(...), ...)`, you’re looking at a *pythonic DSL for HTML* (FastHTML). That’s how the snippet can produce small bits of UI without a separate template system or external files. The entire HTML generation is right next to the logic.

6. **Self-Described Steps**  
   The pipeline steps are enumerated at the top in `self.STEPS`, each has a label like `"step_01"` plus a friendly display label. You see no big framework or config files; it’s all ad hoc yet extremely readable. If you want more steps, you just add them to the list and supply routes.

7. **Jupyter-Like Flow in a Web UI**  
   Each pipeline step is akin to a “cell” in a notebook: it can display something (like a form) and store the result. You can re-enter or skip steps if the pipeline state says so. That bridging concept is what unifies Jupyter’s approach with a typical web wizard, but more elegantly.

8. **Minimized Complexity**  
   There’s no explicit session management, no JS frameworks, no separate client app—just single-file Python code that returns partial HTML. If you look under the hood, the snippet is basically the entire wizard logic in 30-40 lines of code. That’s shockingly small for a multi-step “app.”

9. **Potential for LLM Awareness**  
   Though the snippet doesn’t show it directly, the rest of the system can feed step data to an LLM or even let the LLM *insert steps* or prompt the user. Because each pipeline step is stored in a shared record, an AI can easily read or write that data and transform the user’s journey mid-flow—like an AI cameo in your route code.

10. **Localhost, Single-Tenant**  
   There’s no mention of multiple accounts, tokens, or heavy user management. The entire pipeline belongs to you. That’s the “local, single-tenant” aspect: it’s by design. You can experiment, break, and fix everything in this single file without a big dev-ops pipeline or container setup.

Putting it all together, these design choices produce a *very* flexible “micro-wizard” framework that fuses the minimalism of Unix piping philosophy with a Pythonic single-file style and a bit of web wizardry courtesy of HTMX. It’s simple—but it can scale to surprisingly complex, interactive data workflows.
