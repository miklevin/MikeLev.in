description: As a human, it's important to keep our capacity to care and stay curious. As children, we learn to go from satisfying internal needs to external ones, forming healthy habits. As adults, it's easy to become distracted and stuck in the daily grind. I'm here to remind you to stay open to trying new things and exploring new paths. Read on to find out how to stay curious and engaged in life.

It's good to care. If you find yourself caring about anything, that's a good
thing. It's a precious gift of being human. Hang onto it. The enemy of "being
human" is the loss of the capacity to care which we acquire as young children.
First we go from infants only caring about satisfying internal bodily functions
like hunger to satisfying more external ones like curiosity. We go from nearly
unaware infants to curious toddlers.

During this curious toddler phase, we can start to form good life habits
towards curiosity and learning. Labels like education, math, science and
literacy haven't yet come along to ruin those very topics by creating labels
against which it's fashionable rebelâ€”especially math. We can as youngsters
still immerse ourselves into a thing uninhibited for long enough to somehow
change us and entice us to come back for more, thus changing more. It's a
virtuous feedback loop often lost as adults learning to punch a clock, pay
taxes and otherwise yield to the daily grind.

Things layer up over time, good and bad. Being exposed to a potentially
life-changing thing a single time isn't always enough to ignite a passion.
Distractions that you care about more now, but which in the long run matter
much less, pull you away and block you from discovering new things.

Things you never heard of yet or have the wrong idea about today could become a
new center of your life and a new source for energy and happiness if you just
took the approach of a non-spoiled youngster on first, second and maybe even
third pass. If passion isn't sparked after a few exposures, it's fine to move
on of the promise of rewards isn't enticing enough. That's not quitting. It's
living life, so long as you're open enough to try the next thing.

False-topics of caring drilled into us by parents and schools at this time that
don't always align to our vibes, and even becoming a child prodigy violinist or
whatnot could unintentionally throw up new walls and block new paths to
discovery. It's fine to become good at things young and not to care about it on
the long run. You've sampled life. You've explored potential new realities.
Some peoples passion becomes just that, the trying of new things. I'm not
advocating becoming an experience hoarder, but rather the openness to keep
trying and start caring about something new.

Not caring is a sort of stasis, or passing on a turn in a game. Becoming an
"adult" is often a matter of learning to care less and pass up on lots of
turns. At some point you realize you can't care about everything worth caring
about, and so to protect your own sanity you learn to put up walls. With such
walls up, the challenge then becomes to  to be happy with what's already behind
those walls. There's an appealing stability in this and is how I think most
people live their lives.

We can't all be extreme sports athletes, skydivers and other travelers, and
that's fine. Some of us are born with homebody vibes and getting out to do
anything is a chore. I'm a homebody and the idea of going out and doing
anything is often a horrible prospect. The pandemic has improved my life
immensely by getting rid of the daily commute, and I feel more "myself" than I
have since I was a child. This is a dangerous state for an adult and could
result in a funk.

I could construct some pretty insurmountable walls around myself and turn
inward until I die and experience a sort of happiness, or at least
contentedness. While this thought is cozy and appealing, this is not what I
want. It is a falsehood that this is even an option. Realities of life force us
to engage different ways and at different times. For example, I still need to
make a living. So I fight the tendency to isolate myself and so I still get out
from time to time, but I am thrilled that deep exploration of new things is now
possible online.
