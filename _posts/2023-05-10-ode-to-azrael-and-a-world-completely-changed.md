description: "The Legend of The Bat looms big in my head, even though I started out as a Marvel Comics guy, when Frank Miller's industry-changing Dark Knight Returns graphic novel came out in 1986, I held my nose and switched to DC and followed a number of Batman titles&#151;few of which made a bigger impression on me than the one of Azrael of The Order of St. Dumas who went into fugue states to make gadgets. It's how poetry works with me."

There was a superhero, or perhaps an anti-hero, in the Batman comic books when
Bane first appeared and broke Batman's back. Azrael was the not-so
heir-apparent to the mantle of the Bat, which really pissed off Robin (before
he was cool) who thought he was a shoe-in to be tapped to cover for his mentor,
so he went off to be Nightwing. But I digress.

Azrael was a knight of the Order of Saint Dumas, and he was a bit of a zealot.
His thing was after a night out on the town of Gotham fighting crime in his
fancy neo-bat armor, he would return to the batcave and go into a fugue state
where he would crank out the exact right high-tech gadgets for the next night's
adventure, giving him precisely what he needed so as to not repeat the same
mistakes. Fugue states are an altered state of consciousness where you're
awake, but your subconscious takes over. They're a totally real thing. The
purpose of this journal is to get me into that state.

So as you might imagine, I loved and related to this story and related to it,
because that's exactly how poetry works for me. Not like all stuff, but poetry
for sure. I do not write in verse quite so much as I wake up to find the verse
asserting itself.

This, for example was a little ditty I found in my head this morning after my
company's Spring Fling, which was my first time going into the Manhattan office
in years, and the first time in my new job role. Not sure if I was looking for
The Bat Man or what, but since it was sort of superhero related, I thought I'd
publish it along with the story of where this stuff comes from.

## Vocation of the Mythical White Knight

> When a founder makes a promise  
> And it turns out quite inflated  
> There's a reckoning a coming  
> Though it could be quite belated  
> Because exits, angels holler,  
> Aren't nearly what they need  
> Merely pennies on the dollar  
> Couldn't satisfy their greed.  
>  
> So they make an invitation  
> That is written without sight  
> Meant to conjure the vocation  
> Of the mythical white knight  
> Who then gallops to rescue  
> For the mission he is born  
> Waving banners buzzing askew  
> A big purple unicorn.  
>  
> And the cheers are heard to echo  
> Through the halls in great elation  
> Patting backs they took the reco  
> To swap out that affectation  
> Without slightest thought around  
> Of how totally deranged  
> Abhorrent battle cries sound  
> In a world completely changed.
