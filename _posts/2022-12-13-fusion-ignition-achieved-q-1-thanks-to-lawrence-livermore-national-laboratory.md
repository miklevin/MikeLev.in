headline: US Government Achieves Fusion Ignition - Q = 1, Bringing Us Closer to a Post-Scarcity Society!
description: As a skeptic of private industry's ability to provide free energy, I'm thrilled that the US government funded the successful fusion ignition at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on December 13th, 2022. This clean energy could potentially lead to a post-scarcity society, although it will take some time to get there. Join me as I explore this exciting development and its implications.

I just got the news that fusion energy has achieve Q = 1. The media is calling
it fusion ignition. It happened at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Wow, I'm kind of glad this is a US-funded R&D thing. It's not private industry.
Like the Internet, this world-changing development came from the USA.

Of course my suspicious mind goes immediately to the notion that there's no
path to free energy that doesn't come from the US government... period. Who
knows. At least it's being allowed to enter the public discourse as "clean"
energy. The societally transforming "free" part that puts us on the path to a
post-scarcity society can be delayed a few decades if that's what it has to be.
