Okay, so I need first, second and 3rd lines of defenses on this lawyer thing. I
need to reach out to the courts involved and let them know I have to change
lawyers. It may have some ramification on the dates. I look around me and even
with this month off, I can't believe how disorganized I let myself get in
certain ways. It's time to slam the brakes on that bad behavior and do a series
of 80/20-rule sweeps of the information, data and resources in my life. 

Also, let's talk priorities and realities. I haven't seen my kid in over a
month, except in court. This was a great relief, as I really did think they
were missing. After all the media hype of child abductions because of ***The
Sound of Freedom*** and a complete cutting me off of all communication
including the type that was legally required by the custody agreement, I did
not know where my child was. I was not even sure they were alive. Cut off
completely is cut off complete. We're talking social media, text, phone, email,
everything. And this was well before some papers or others that I still don't
really understand were "served on me". I was just cut off. And I was scared.

Next, I have learned a bit since. It's perfectly legal for me to see and have
my weekends with my child now. It's just all communication of every kind with a
certain individual is prevented. I can't even send money, because that is
communication. I have to check with a lawyer on the precise details, but the
judge was extremely thorough in his description. Sending money is communication
and the judge's judgement supersedes the custody agreement. That was made very
clear. So I'm putting child support into a savings account for now.

I could completely be getting together with my child every weekend still. The
order does not prevent that. I just cant reach out to a certain person in any
way. But I can talk through intermediaries as long as no request is made to
pass messages or any other sort of communication. And so I have reached out to
my child's step-father... if that's what he even is. I don't know what to call
him. He was my neighbor who had a child with my wife at the time while we were
married. 

I know that makes me sound like a cuckold, but it's time to talk reality here.
That's my situation. So you can see the sort of moral and ethical
underpinnings, or lack thereof, from where this attack is coming. My wife got
pregnant with a neighbor and divorced me and I pay $2025.50 a month in child
support.

The main thing here is going to be to try to silence my voice. For this entire
month of paid leave, I've been a bit verklempt over that issue. Is even talking
about the fact that there IS a case wrong? NO! It's the details of the case
that can not be discussed, if even that. I don't even exactly know and I know
that ignorance of the law is no excuse for violating it. And of course, there
may be consequences even for this writing, but I have to do all the writing for
the lawyer. I'll actually be summarizing it for them.

Don't let every project become a deep dive. And don't let any project become
sidelined by distraction. Find that balance so that a series of 80/20-Rule
sweeps work your way in to the most important things. And then, when you have
the time, you can do a deep dive on the most important things.
