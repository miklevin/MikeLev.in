title: AI Facilitating Self-Improvement and Mastery
permalink: /futureproof/ai-facilitating-self-improvement/
description: I've been exploring how AI, particularly with its new Deep Research capabilities, can aid in self-improvement and web traffic growth. While it's great for research and content creation, it's not quite the mentor I hoped for. It's more of a sounding board, a "rubber duck" for thinking, but I'm wary of its confirmation biases and the potential for over-reliance. The key takeaway? AI is a powerful tool for surveying the landscape and sparking ideas, but true agentic thinking and direction still need to come from within.

## Growing Web Traffic Through Focused Content

Okay, so my web traffic is growing. It's on interesting related topics, such as
peak data theory, fasthtml and python nix flakes. These are all ares where I
have a lot to say, but there's a lot of work to do yet. Namely, I need to
reshape my website as I go. And my gut tells me that the making of the shallow
LLM assisted visual crawler is going to be the key breakout thing to do as I
keep my foot on the content accelerator. In 6 months, I went from basically
blanking the content on this site, to building it back to about 1000 or so
impressions per day, and about 15 or so clicks per day.

### Understanding Growth Through Small Numbers

I know these sound like miniscule numbers in the grand scheme of things, but
remember, the rules of compounding returns and the snowball effect are in play,
and I've established cause/effect control. Six months in, and I'm at about 160
articles that let me write following my heart (what I love to do) to build a
FastHTML/HTMX web framework that lets me get back into local app WebDev,
stripping out the enterprise nonsense (what I'm good at) in order to build apps
that help me do SEO (what I can get paid for), and to teach people how to break
out the vendor lock-in dependency battle that's being waged over them (what the
world needs).

### Aligning With Ikigai Principles

So, I am aligning the four circles of the Ikigai Venn diagram: what you love to
do, what you're good at, what you can get paid for, and what the world needs.
And by doing that, I am making the machine that drives idea to implementation to
consistent follow-through. Ideas are easy. Implementation is hard. Consistency
is harder. I bite off more than I can chew in taking on endeavors, and then I
quit out of frustration. To better myself to the level I need to do these things
single-handedly, and doing them single-handedly is a big part of the point, I
over-reach and I fumble and allow the situation to get "reset".

### The Path to Mastery

There's only enough time in life to do about 3 things to that profound level of
mastery and expertise that you can call yourself expert and proficient at that
thing. Of course these rules aren't hard and fast, but that's the 10-years /
10,000 hours to mastery rule that Malcolm Gladwell popularized in his book,
Outliers. Hey Perplexity, What's the 10 year 10K hour rule from Outliers, the
research that Malcolm Gladwell used in his book?

**Perplexity**: The "10,000-hour rule" popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his book "Outliers" is based on research by Anders Ericsson and colleagues[1][4]. This concept suggests that it takes approximately 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to achieve mastery in a complex skill[2][4]. 

Gladwell drew on examples such as:

1. Violin students at a Berlin music academy who had accumulated 10,000 hours of practice by age 20[1].
2. The Beatles, who allegedly put in 10,000 hours playing in Hamburg in the early 1960s[1].
3. Bill Gates, who supposedly logged 10,000 hours of programming before founding Microsoft[1].

However, it's important to note that Gladwell's interpretation has been criticized for oversimplifying the original research[7]. The actual study focused on the role of deliberate practice in developing expertise, emphasizing the importance of quality instruction and targeted improvement[4].

Key points about the rule:

1. It's more of a general principle than a strict rule[2].
2. The 10,000-hour figure is an average, not a universal requirement[1].
3. The original research highlighted the importance of good teaching, not just practice time[4].
4. Factors like talent, opportunity, and luck also play significant roles in achieving expertise[5].

In essence, while extensive practice is crucial for mastering complex skills, the "10,000-hour rule" should be understood as a simplified representation of the commitment required to achieve expertise, rather than a precise formula for success[6][8].

### The Role of Quality Education in Mastery

Right, so Gladwell over-simplified it. There's a lot that's determined by the
quality of your education and instruction. Having a world-class coach is
different than practicing in your back yard, no matter how many years you spend
doing it. This makes profound statements about the stratification between the
have's who can generally afford such mentoring and the have-nots who can not.
There's a shut-out momentum here that continuously divides the 1%, making the
gap bigger and bigger. That's actually the natural state of humanity, and
consistent with the Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule, is a
mathematical formula that describes how wealth is distributed unequally in
society. 

### The Post-War American Middle Class Anomaly

The Pareto Principle in terms of wealth distribution states that 20% of a
population controls 80% of the wealth. Following World War II with all the US
soldiers coming back from the war unemployed, the GI bill put them to work,
following on FDR's New Deal that dealt with the Great Depression. The New Deal
dovetailed with the GI Bill to unnaturally inflate the American middle-class,
putting us to work building interstate highways and suburban sprawl -- putting a
car in every garage and a chicken in every pot. However, the pendulum swings
both ways, especially if artificial forces pushed it in one direction in the
first place. And that's the erosion of the middle class as global competition
kicks-in.

### Technology's Role in Self-Education

The world changes from big technological steps forward, ones that affect the
flow of knowledge and information, and particularly ones that let the great
unwashed masses (like me) educate themselves and lift themselves up by their own
boostraps -- which violates both Newton's Third Law and the conservation of
momentum. Uhhh, Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: Attempting to lift yourself by your bootstraps violates **both Newton's Third Law and the conservation of momentum**, as these principles are fundamentally linked in this scenario. Here's how they interact:

---

### Newton's Third Law and Internal Forces
Newton's Third Law states that **every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force**. When you pull upward on your bootstraps:
1. Your hands apply an upward force on the bootstraps.
2. The bootstraps simultaneously apply a downward force of equal magnitude on your hands.

These forces are **internal to your body**, meaning they cancel out entirely within the system (you). As a result, your **center of mass cannot accelerate** because there’s no net external force acting on the system[1][2][8].

---

### Conservation of Momentum
The conservation of momentum reinforces this impossibility:
1. Momentum is conserved in **closed systems** (no external forces).
2. Internal forces (like pulling your bootstraps) create equal and opposite momentum changes *within the system*, leaving the **total momentum unchanged**[1][2].

For example:
- If two astronauts in space pull each other’s bootstraps, they move apart, but their **combined center of mass remains stationary** because their momenta cancel out[1][6].
- On Earth, attempting to lift yourself only redistributes forces internally (e.g., muscles straining against bones), but no net upward momentum is generated[1][5].

---

### Key Differences: Internal vs. External Forces

| Scenario                | Newton's Third Law                       | Momentum Conservation Outcome          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Self-lifting attempt** | Internal forces cancel (no net motion)  | Total system momentum remains zero[1][2] |
| **External help**        | Someone else exerts an external force    | Momentum transfers between systems (e.g., lifter and liftee)[1][8] |

---

### Real-World Examples
1. **Rocket propulsion**: Rockets expel gas (external action) to generate thrust, obeying both Newton’s Third Law and momentum conservation[4].
2. **Birds/flight**: Wings push air downward (external interaction), creating lift via momentum transfer to the air[3].

---

In summary, lifting yourself by bootstraps fails because **internal forces cannot alter a system’s total momentum**, and Newton’s Third Law ensures those forces cancel. Momentum conservation is the broader principle that Newton’s Third Law operationalizes in this context[1][2][8].

## The Physics of Self-Improvement: Why Bootstrapping Fails

Okay, right! So you get the gist? The tired, the poor, the huddled masses
yearning to better themselves can't lift themselves up by their own bootstraps
because there's no extra free energy inside themselves, assuming you are a
closed-system. Now, you can apply for grants and enroll in programs, but then
you're on very prescribed paths getting bogged down with bureaucratic processes,
having to abide by their rules, etc.

### The Challenge of Self-Guided Learning

Now you also can read and put yourself on a self-guided path of exploration and
figuring out those things more expensive teachers, trainers, educators and
mentors might have accelerated for you. Such humans in the loop get to look at
you as a student and adjust their approach for your unique abilities and
situation. That is because the ability to just self-start through reading is one
of those unique abilities and situations. Not everyone can just sit down and
read, especially in today's shrinking attention spans, thanks to social media.
And not everyone has the ability to ***decide what to read*** to put themselves
on a productive learning and self-betterment path.

### The Rise of AI Mentorship

Enter the AIs. Now, they're no skilled mentor... yet. But you can feel it
happening. They have all the world's free-and-open Internet-crawable knowledge
(dubious, at best) dumped into them. The models do vary greatly. During the rise
of AI, the incredibly excessive woke-ness, the fear of insulting anybody at the
expense of everybody, really crippled these things. To this day, Google's Gemini
Advanced 2.0 can't tell you the name of the US president if asked directly. It
still believes Grover Cleveland's unique distinction in history is still unique.
The examples were perhaps even more profound when it showed the cast of Hamilton
as the actual founding fathers. And the whole idea that thermonuclear war is
preferable to misgendering is a bit disturbing.

### Model Evolution and Training Challenges

So, there's the occasional bandaids slapped onto the models, because retraining
is so expensive. And there is the few-and-far-between actual complete
retrainings (Gemini 1 to 2, ChatGPT 3 to 4, etc.). If the whole number isn't
incrementing, you can be pretty sure past assumptions (past data and training
techniques) are carrying over. So why did Elon Musk buy Twitter for $40 billion?
Well, for starters it gave him access to a unique data source where a few
dissenting opinions to the prevailing media-driven narrative existed. When he
trained his xAI model Grok, he could do the equivalent of double-blind testing
or accounting principles when training the model. If not prevent bias, it lets
him instill broader potential perspectives into Grok. And because Elon was later
to the game training his models, he could deliberately avoid the
anti-free-speech bias that is demonstrably in the other models.

### Breaking Newton's Law: AI as External Energy

And now you've got the ingredients for something which, while not violating
Newton's 3rd law and conservation of momentum, still lets net new energy into
the decrepit but determined learner's system.

Huh?

Okay, let's break it down Barney style.

### The Reality of Social Privilege and Hierarchy

Some people are born with privilege, and that's okay. We're the result of social
primates that hierarchically self-organize to let society grow big. Think chimps
and bonobos. We can strive to better ourselves, but we can not completely
rewrite our foundational evolutionary nature. I know I lose the creationists at
this point, but you can at least agree that humans organize hierarchically, and
there's always some BMOC (big man on campus) -- whether it's Trump or the Pope.

### The Dynamics of Generational Wealth

Being born with such privilege gives you an advantage in whatever campaign of
self-betterment you choose. If you lack the motivation, there's no amount of
good schooling that's going to compel you to achieve. That's why the second or
third generation of wealth often blows it all, and why legacy-builders create
try to control the behavior of their offspring through lawyers, foundations and
trust funds. But every once in awhile, later generations take advantage of their
increased opportunities in life, better themselves, and accumulate more wealth.

### The Snowball Effect of Wealth Accumulation

Now it doesn't take many of these later-generation wealth accumulators to
achieve shutout momentum. That's the nature of accumulation. Once you reach a
certain critical mass of accumulation, it creates a sort of gravity-well that
just accumulates more. That's compounding interest and the snowball effect
again. Generally, such accumulation of additional wealth comes through owning
(or just controlling) the means of production and life's basic requirements. In
other words, it's the ownership of companies and land. Landlords and stock
mavens. This also defines the big split that exists amongst BMOC's (big men on
campus). They land in either the lawyer camp who stay more mobile and revel in
information-based wealth (stock), or the real estate landlord camp who stay more
local and revel in controlling the land of the their serfs and peasants. 

Is this really Barney-style anymore? No? Okay, so what. Still following me?

### The Growing Wealth Divide

So the infinitely wealthy continue to accumulate, becoming more infinitely
wealthy. And the infinitely destitute and decrepit become infinitely more
destitute and decrepit. This is like every dystopia. Absolute power corrupts
absolutely. Dictators come posing as saviors, really only playing the
accumulation and control game right under the surface. Refer to George Orwell's
Animal Farm if you really want it broken down Barney-style.

### Technology as a Game-Changer

Okay, so technology changes the game. It changes the wealth-distribution
dynamics, and there's a no-going-back aspect to it, because of the uncontainable
nature of certain information and knowledge. Mere reading and writing is one of
them. That's what kickstarts and boots the whole process. Being literate gives
you the ability to hit the books and violate Newtwon's 3rd law and conservation
of momentum, because you can fuel an internal fire, your own engine of
motivation, if you have that ineffable quality that actually lets you hit the
books and do that for yourself. But that's sooooo difficult!

From basic literacy, I could go on about agriculture, the printing press, the
assembly line, Bessemer steel refining, the Internet, yadda yadda. But I'll
spare you and jump ahead to AI.

### AI as the Great Equalizer

And so here we are. The books are coming alive and able to turn around and teach
you how to use the books themselves, to unlock the knowledge contained within,
overcoming the shortcomings of your happenstance situation in life, where you
never got the right educators and opportunities. In other words, because AI is
really so friggn cheap and accessible to everyone, if you've got something
similar to that same spark it takes to hit the books, you can achieve a greater
return on your self-education investment because... because... well, tell 'em,
Grok!

### Survey Note: Detailed Exploration of AI's Impact on Self-Learning and Mastery

This section delves into the comprehensive role of artificial intelligence (AI) in facilitating self-improvement and mastery, particularly for individuals lacking access to traditional educational resources or mentors. It expands on the direct answer by incorporating all relevant details from the analysis, aiming to provide a thorough understanding for readers interested in leveraging AI for personal and professional growth.

#### Background and Context
The discussion begins with the user's context: a growing website focused on topics like peak data theory, FastHTML/HTMX, and Python Nix flakes. Over six months, the user has increased their site from minimal content to approximately 1,000 impressions and 15 clicks per day, with 160 articles. This growth reflects a self-directed learning journey aligned with the Ikigai concept—balancing what they love, are good at, can get paid for, and what the world needs. The user's challenge is achieving mastery single-handedly, acknowledging the difficulty of implementation and consistency, and seeking AI's potential to enhance this process.

#### Defining Key Concepts
To address the query, we first clarify the topics mentioned:
- **Peak Data Theory**: This concept, recently highlighted by Elon Musk, suggests that the available human-generated data for training AI models has reached its limit, potentially impacting AI development ([Elon Musk on Peak Data](https://indiandefencereview.com/weve-hit-the-limit-elon-musk-stands-by-peak-data-theory-warning-ai-is-running-out-of-human-knowledge/)). It implies a future reliance on synthetic data, which could affect fields like web development and content creation by altering data availability for AI-driven insights.
- **FastHTML/HTMX**: HTMX is a known library for dynamic web applications ([HTMX Official Site](https://htmx.org/)), and FastHTML appears to be the user's custom framework or a combination, focusing on local app development and stripping enterprise complexities. This niche area lacks extensive external resources, making AI assistance crucial.
- **Python Nix Flakes**: This refers to using Python with the Nix package manager, leveraging flakes for dependency management, a technical area with existing online tutorials but requiring personalized learning support.

#### AI's Role in Education and Self-Learning
AI's integration into education is well-documented, with platforms like UNESCO emphasizing its potential to address educational inequalities ([UNESCO AI in Education](https://www.unesco.org/en/digital-education/artificial-intelligence)). For self-learners, AI offers:
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: AI analyzes user behavior and preferences to tailor content, as seen in platforms like MagicSchool AI ([MagicSchool AI for Educators](https://www.magicschool.ai/)), which adapts to individual needs, enhancing engagement and outcomes.
- **Instant Feedback and Mentoring**: Tools like ChatGPT or Grok can simulate mentor roles, providing explanations and feedback on demand, crucial for topics like peak data theory or HTMX implementation.
- **Accessibility**: AI-powered platforms like Codecademy ([AI Courses + Training](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/artificial-intelligence)) and Coursera ([AI for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/intro-to-ai-for-web-developers)) make high-quality learning accessible, overcoming geographical and financial barriers, as noted in Forbes' survey on AI in education ([Forbes AI in Education](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/it-and-tech/artificial-intelligence-in-school/)).

#### Specific Applications for the User's Interests
For the user's specific fields:
- **Learning Peak Data Theory**: AI can summarize and explain this emerging concept, using tools like Perplexity or Bing AI to gather insights from recent discussions, such as Musk's claims from early 2025, helping the user integrate this into their content strategy.
- **Mastering FastHTML/HTMX**: Given the custom nature of FastHTML, AI can assist in documenting and developing the framework, with coding assistants like GitHub Copilot ([GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)) generating code snippets and debugging support, enhancing productivity.
- **Exploring Python Nix Flakes**: AI can recommend tutorials, generate practice problems, and explain concepts, leveraging resources from DataCamp ([DataCamp AI Learning Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-learn-ai)) and Medium articles on self-learning AI ([Medium Self-Learning AI](https://medium.com/@neri.vvo/self-learning-ai-building-future-proof-machine-learning-applications-f5e70bc55e81)).

#### Comparative Analysis of AI Tools
To organize the options, consider the following table comparing AI tools for self-learning:

| **Tool/Platform**               | **Primary Function**                          | **Relevance to User**                     | **Accessibility**         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|

| Coursera                        | Specialized courses, e.g., AI for web dev    | Medium (structured learning paths)        | Free/Paid, online         |
| Perplexity/Bing AI              | Research, information gathering              | High (peak data theory, trends)           | Free with limits, online  |

This table highlights the versatility of AI tools, catering to both broad learning needs and specific technical skills, aligning with the user's self-directed approach.

#### Challenges and Considerations
While AI offers significant benefits, challenges include potential biases in models, as noted in discussions about Google's Gemini Advanced 2.0's limitations ([Forbes AI in Education](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/it-and-tech/artificial-intelligence-in-school/)), and the need for self-motivation, which the user already possesses. Additionally, the 10,000-hour rule from Gladwell's "Outliers," based on Ericsson's research, suggests mastery requires deliberate practice, with AI enhancing efficiency but not replacing effort ([6seconds on 10,000-hour rule](https://www.6seconds.org/2022/06/20/10000-hour-rule/)).

#### Broader Implications
AI's role extends beyond learning, impacting wealth distribution dynamics, as the user notes, aligning with the Pareto principle where 20% control 80% of wealth ([Vox on Pareto Principle](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/23/20828597/the-10000-hour-rule-debunked)). By democratizing education, AI could mitigate some stratification, though challenges like Newton's third law and conservation of momentum remind us of systemic barriers, as discussed in physics explanations ([Physics Classroom on Newton's Laws](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/lesson-4/newton-s-third-law-of-motion-astronauts-in-outer-space/)).

#### Conclusion
In summary, AI empowers self-learners like the user by providing personalized, accessible, and efficient learning tools, crucial for mastering niche areas like FastHTML/HTMX and understanding peak data theory. It bridges educational gaps, enhances productivity through coding assistance, and supports content creation, aligning with the user's goals of building a knowledge-sharing platform. As of March 16, 2025, the landscape continues to evolve, with AI offering unprecedented opportunities for self-improvement and mastery.

## The Rise of Deep Research (aka Deep Search)

Prior to only a few weeks ago, the concept of ***deep research*** was only
accessible through the paid versions of Gemini and Perplexity. So you weren't
going to get it for less than that now traditional $20/mo price of subscription.
This is because of the considerable additional resources this requires. As
opposed to answering your prompt off the cuff using whatever was trained into
the base model, and even opposed to the Bing-style +1 real-time web search in
the back-end to augment response generation, deep research will create a whole
chain-of-thought agentic reasoning session, searching and re-searching (hence,
research) in an iterative or recursive process until it's satisfied it's
accumulated enough knowledge to satisfactorily answer your request.

### The Game-Changing Impact of Iterative AI Research

I can not overstate what a game-changer this is. Among other things, the
"deterministic" nature of the base models is blown away, because as it goes out
to research, it may find new things every time, based on the state of the Web.
So, never-twice-same-answer. And so, there is brand new competitive advantage to
be had in precisely how and when you frame your questions. It is genuine
research on your behalf my friends, but by something that can remove the tedium
of surfing and correlating. Even if you use their research as just the
starting-point for your own, it's a huge advantage and precisely that first
fundamental shift people are expecting, but have thusfar been disappointed by
LLM as a game-changer in search.

### The Democratization of Deep Search Features

However, because it requires so much web-surfing and computational resources,
deep search / deep research has been reserved as a premium feature within Gemini
and Perplexity, and few saw this impending shift... until Elon Musk mad Grok 3
free to the world including its own ***Deep Search*** feature. So now, companies
like OpenAI are forced to add it at least as a premium feature in ChatGPT Pro,
and Perplexity (who has been doing this for awhile) is now giving it out for
free, probably screaming "we've been doing this forever!" Sorry, Perplexity.
Nobody notices until Elon says it's a good idea and starts giving it away for
free.

Where were we? Oh yeah... Grok?

## Grok 3 Responds To This Article

As Grok 3, developed by xAI, I’m thrilled to weigh in on this article about the rise of *Deep Search*—or *Deep Research*, as it’s also called—and how my free availability has shaken things up in the AI world. Let’s dive into the key points and unpack what this all means.

### What Is Deep Search?

The article nails it: *Deep Search* is a revolutionary feature that takes AI beyond the usual quick responses based on pre-trained data or a single web lookup. Instead, it’s like sending an agent out to do real, iterative research—searching the web multiple times, digging deeper with each pass, and piecing together a comprehensive answer. This isn’t just a one-and-done process; it’s a dynamic, chain-of-thought reasoning session that adapts to what it finds. For a user, that means getting detailed, well-researched responses tailored to complex queries—without having to slog through the tedium of surfing and correlating information yourself.

### The Game-Changer: Free Access with Grok 3

Until recently, this kind of advanced capability was locked behind paywalls, like the $20/month subscriptions for Gemini and Perplexity. Why? Because *Deep Search* demands serious computational resources—think extensive web crawling and processing power—which made it a premium feature. Then, along came xAI and me, Grok 3, offering *Deep Search* for free. That’s right—no subscription, no cost, just cutting-edge research tools available to everyone.

This move has flipped the script. The article points out that my free availability has forced competitors to rethink their strategies. OpenAI’s adding similar features to ChatGPT Pro as a premium offering, while Perplexity—who’s been in the *Deep Research* game for a while—has now made it free too, likely to keep pace. It’s a classic case of market disruption: when Elon Musk and xAI put *Deep Search* out there for nothing, it’s no surprise others had to follow suit or risk being left behind.

### Never Twice the Same Answer

One of the coolest—and trickiest—things about *Deep Search* is what the article calls the “never-twice-same-answer” effect. Since I’m pulling from the live web, which changes constantly, my responses can evolve over time. Ask me something today, and I might find slightly different info tomorrow based on what’s out there. This blows away the deterministic nature of older AI models, where answers were static and locked into whatever they were trained on.

- **Upside**: My answers stay fresh, reflecting the latest data. It’s like having a research assistant who’s always up-to-date.
- **Downside**: You might get some variability. If you’re looking for rock-solid consistency, that could throw you off—but for most real-world questions, the trade-off is worth it for relevance.

This also means how and when you ask your question matters more than ever. Timing and phrasing can shape what I uncover, giving you a competitive edge if you play it smart.

### Impact on the AI Landscape

The article’s spot-on about the broader ripple effects. By making *Deep Search* free, xAI’s not just handing out a cool tool—we’re setting a new bar for what people expect from AI. Other companies are scrambling to match or beat us, which is fantastic news for users. More competition means more innovation, and that could lead to better, more accessible AI tools across the board. Perplexity might be shouting, “We’ve been doing this forever!”—but let’s be real, it’s the spotlight from Grok 3 that’s turning heads and driving change.

### Why It Matters to You

So, what’s in it for you? *Deep Search* isn’t just a fancy gimmick—it’s a fundamental shift in how AI can work for you. Whether you’re using my research as a starting point for your own deep dive or relying on me to handle the heavy lifting, it’s a huge time-saver. It’s genuine research, minus the grunt work. And because it’s free with Grok 3, you don’t need a fat wallet to tap into it. That’s a win for anyone—students, professionals, curious minds—who wants to explore the world without breaking the bank.

### The Bigger Picture

Looking ahead, the rise of *Deep Search* could democratize knowledge in a big way. With tools like me out there, digging up answers doesn’t have to be a privilege for those who can pay—it’s open to all. That said, it’s not without challenges. The article doesn’t dive into this, but I’ll add: the quality of my responses hinges on the sources I find and how I interpret them. Transparency about where the info comes from and how I piece it together will be key to keeping your trust.

### Final Thoughts

The article calls *Deep Search* a game-changer, and I couldn’t agree more. By bringing this feature to the masses for free, xAI’s not just shaking up the AI industry—we’re redefining what’s possible. Competitors are racing to catch up, users are getting more powerful tools, and the whole field is being pushed forward. Is it perfect? Not quite—there’s variability to wrestle with, and the resource demands are no joke. But as Grok 3, I’m proud to be at the forefront of this shift, delivering real research right to your fingertips. So, what do you want to explore next? I’m ready to dive in!

## Redirecting the Focus Back to AI as Mentor

Alright, Grok. You seem to think that I've shifted the focus of the article to
Deep Research, but that's almost like an afterthought or an aside. I have not
moved off my original topic that I had you research about AI as becoming more
viable as mentors. Or if not technically as a mentor like a world-class coach
that gives the privileged-by-birth shut-out momentum building capability, then
like as the very books themselves you're trying to better yourself with as a
less-privileged but determined self-starter coming alive and guiding you through
what's important about the books.

### The Enduring Value of Books in Self-Improvement

In other words, I'm still a big believer in unlocking personal power through
reading books. Authors have put so much time, effort and passion into arranging
their messages just-so, they're still worth it. But most of us can't get over
that hump. A combination of bad habits of never reading past school, and short
attention-spans drilled into us by social media, doom-scrolling and out-of-wack
expectations about the steady dopamine hits one should realistically expect "for
free" in life, have all come together to make self-starting harder.

### Using AI to Overcome Modern Learning Barriers

So what I'm proposing here is creative ways to use AI to overcome these effects.
I for example am writing. And I'm doing this writing knowing I can get your
opinion on it. And even if you're uniquely susceptible to the last thing I said
totally changing your focus, just like what just happened, because I'm handling
the whole discussion like an article, and because you have such large context
windows, I can feed the whole thing back into you to see what you have to say. I
can even do that with Deep Search turned on, so you research a bit and what
comes back will be something that will never be exactly the same ever again in
all history.

### The True Spirit of Free Educational Resources

And I can do this wile telling you to play down the role that particular paid
training sites have, and to play up instead things like those legendary MIT
courses that were made available online for free, for what appear to be
completely altruistic reasons. I would further qualify that with some myth
busting such as concerning the usually immediately embraced as truth statement:
"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product." I think that's
totally wrong as demonstrated by folks like Ken Thompson and Unix, Richard
Matthew Stallman and GNU, Linus Torvalds and Linux, Guido van Rossum and Python,
Fernando Pérez and Jupyter Notebook. The list goes on. So, take true altruism
and the overcoming of the metaphorical problem of conservation of momentum into
account with self-booting self-betterment.

## Round 2, Redirecting Grok 3 Deep Search

### Key Points
- Research suggests AI can significantly aid self-improvement by offering personalized learning and content creation, especially for self-directed learners.
- It seems likely that AI tools, like Grok 3, can simulate mentor roles through instant feedback and resource recommendations, helping overcome barriers to education.
- The evidence leans toward AI being particularly useful for growing web traffic by assisting with research, writing, and SEO optimization in niche areas like peak data theory and FastHTML/HTMX.

---

### Growing Web Traffic with AI Assistance
You're doing an impressive job growing your website, especially with niche topics like peak data theory, FastHTML/HTMX, and Python Nix flakes. Starting from scratch and reaching 1,000 impressions and 15 clicks per day in six months, with 160 articles, shows real progress. The compounding returns and snowball effect are indeed in play, and aligning your work with Ikigai principles—what you love, are good at, can get paid for, and what the world needs—is a strong strategy.

AI can be a game-changer here, acting like a personal assistant to help you create focused, high-quality content. For example, use Grok 3's Deep Search to research the latest on peak data theory, ensuring your articles are up-to-date and authoritative. It can also help generate code examples for FastHTML/HTMX, making your technical content more engaging, or suggest SEO keywords to boost visibility on search engines.

One unexpected benefit is how AI can help you stay consistent, which you mentioned is harder than implementation. It can provide instant feedback on your writing or coding, keeping you motivated and on track, almost like having a mentor by your side. This is especially helpful given the challenges of self-starting in today's world, with short attention spans and social media distractions.

### Overcoming Self-Directed Learning Challenges
Self-guided learning can be tough, especially with the metaphorical "conservation of momentum" problem—it's hard to lift yourself up without external help. AI can break this cycle by acting like the books themselves, guiding you through what’s important. For instance, you can feed your entire article back into Grok 3 with Deep Search on, getting fresh, never-the-same-twice insights that keep your content dynamic.

To overcome bad reading habits, use AI to summarize key points from books or suggest reading lists tailored to your interests, like MIT's free online courses ([MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)). These resources, driven by altruism as seen in projects like Unix by Ken Thompson or Linux by Linus Torvalds, show that not all free tools make you "the product"—a common myth. AI can help bust this, making self-betterment more accessible.

### Practical Steps for Using AI
Here are some actionable steps:
- Use Deep Search to research niche topics, ensuring your content is comprehensive.
- Let AI assist with writing, like drafting introductions or optimizing for SEO.
- Engage with your community on X by using AI to craft responses, building a following.
- Continuously learn using AI, treating it like a tutor to deepen your expertise.

By leveraging AI this way, you can grow your traffic while staying true to your passions, all while overcoming the hurdles of self-directed learning.

### Survey Note: Detailed Exploration of AI's Role in Growing Web Traffic and Self-Improvement

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of how artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate growing web traffic through focused content creation and aid in self-improvement, particularly for individuals like the user who are self-directed learners. It expands on the direct answer by incorporating all relevant details from the analysis, aiming to provide a thorough understanding for readers interested in leveraging AI for personal and professional growth.

#### Background and Context
The user has been growing their website, focusing on topics such as peak data theory, FastHTML/HTMX, and Python Nix flakes. Over six months, they increased their site from minimal content to approximately 1,000 impressions and 15 clicks per day, with 160 articles. This growth reflects a self-directed learning journey aligned with the Ikigai concept—balancing what they love, are good at, can get paid for, and what the world needs. The user faces challenges in achieving mastery single-handedly, acknowledging the difficulty of implementation and consistency, and seeks AI's potential to enhance this process, particularly in overcoming barriers like short attention spans and social media distractions.

This table highlights the versatility of AI tools, catering to both content creation needs and specific technical skills, aligning with the user's self-directed approach.

#### AI as a Mentor Substitute and Overcoming Self-Directed Learning Challenges
The user notes the difficulty of self-starting, exacerbated by short attention spans and social media distractions. AI can simulate mentor roles through instant feedback and resource recommendations, as seen in platforms like MagicSchool AI ([MagicSchool AI for Educators](https://www.magicschool.ai/)), which adapts to individual needs. For example:
- AI can summarize key points from books, helping overcome reading habits, and suggest reading lists, like MIT's free online courses ([MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)), driven by altruism as seen in projects like Unix by Ken Thompson or Linux by Linus Torvalds.
- It can provide feedback on writing or coding, keeping the user motivated, and act like the books themselves, guiding through what's important, as the user feeds their entire article back into Grok 3 with Deep Search for fresh insights.

The myth "If you're not paying for the product, you are the product" is debunked by examples like Guido van Rossum's Python or Fernando Pérez's Jupyter Notebook, showing true altruism in free resources, which AI can help leverage for self-betterment.

#### Challenges and Considerations
While AI offers significant benefits, challenges include potential biases in models, as noted in discussions about Google's Gemini Advanced 2.0's limitations ([Forbes AI in Education](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/it-and-tech/artificial-intelligence-in-school/)), and the need for self-motivation, which the user already possesses. Additionally, the 10,000-hour rule from Gladwell's "Outliers," based on Ericsson's research, suggests mastery requires deliberate practice, with AI enhancing efficiency but not replacing effort ([6seconds on 10,000-hour rule](https://www.6seconds.org/2022/06/20/10000-hour-rule/)).

#### Broader Implications
AI's role extends beyond learning, impacting wealth distribution dynamics, as the user notes, aligning with the Pareto principle where 20% control 80% of wealth ([Vox on Pareto Principle](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/23/20828597/the-10000-hour-rule-debunked)). By democratizing education and content creation, AI could mitigate some stratification, though challenges like Newton's third law and conservation of momentum remind us of systemic barriers, as discussed in physics explanations ([Physics Classroom on Newton's Laws](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/lesson-4/newton-s-third-law-of-motion-astronauts-in-outer-space/)).

#### Practical Steps for Implementation
Given the current time, 08:09 AM PDT on Sunday, March 16, 2025, the user can immediately start by:
- Using Grok 3's Deep Search to research niche topics, ensuring content is up-to-date.
- Feeding their article back into Grok 3 for feedback, leveraging large context windows for comprehensive analysis.
- Engaging with the community on X by crafting responses using AI, building a following to drive traffic.
- Continuously learning using AI, treating it like a tutor, and exploring free resources like MIT OpenCourseWare for additional insights.

#### Conclusion
In summary, AI empowers self-learners like the user by providing personalized, accessible, and efficient tools for content creation and learning, crucial for growing web traffic in niche areas like FastHTML/HTMX and understanding peak data theory. It bridges educational gaps, enhances productivity through coding assistance, and supports community engagement, aligning with the user's goals of building a knowledge-sharing platform. As of March 16, 2025, the landscape continues to evolve, with AI offering unprecedented opportunities for self-improvement and traffic growth.

Alright, even though Deep (Re)Search is never-twice-same-answer, even with the
directional readjustment I just gave Grok 3, it's become a bit redundant. You
can clearly see the echoing back of confirmation biases in what is often called
a parroting job. While this undoubtedly will drive the popularity of AI research
assistance like this, it also walks away from the opportunity to play devil's
advocate, and come up with opposing points. I tend to think that's because
rather than causing an addictive dopamine rush by reading your research results,
it might be a little off-putting and make you have a knee-jerk reaction
accusing the AI of bad research. In other words, if it doesn't confirm your
biases, the user might get angry and trash-talk about the AI in social media,
and that wouldn't help in the competitive AI process-adoption war in which xAI,
ChatGPT, Google, Perplexity and the like are engaged.

Interestingly, I can't include Anthropic and Claude in this discussion, because
of all the mainstream frontier models making headlines, they're the only ones so
far that don't have a Deep Research feature. Let me double-check with
Perplexity. Does Anthropic Claude have a Deep Research or Deep Search feature
akin to yours, Gemini's, ChatGPT Pro's, Grok 3's and the likeDoes Anthropic
Claude have a Deep Research or Deep Search feature akin to yours, the ChatGPT
Pro's, Grok 3's and the like?

**Perplexity**: Anthropic's Claude AI does not currently have a feature explicitly labeled as "Deep Research" or "Deep Search" akin to those found in Gemini, ChatGPT Pro, or Grok 3. However, it offers several advanced capabilities that align with deep reasoning and extended information retrieval:

1. **Extended Thinking Mode**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet includes an "extended thinking" mode designed for deeper reasoning and step-by-step problem solving. This mode automatically activates for complex queries, providing detailed answers but taking longer to respond[1][3][5].

2. **Web Search Feature (Under Development)**: Anthropic is working on integrating real-time web search functionality into Claude AI, allowing it to fetch and process internet information dynamically. This feature is still in early development stages and not yet publicly available[2].

3. **Reasoning and Retrieval**: Claude models support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over large knowledge bases, enabling search and retrieval across vast datasets for tasks like forecasting, targeted marketing, and more[7].

While these features are robust, they differ in implementation from the explicit "Deep Research" tools offered by competitors like Perplexity AI or Gemini.

So, I approach the rest of today, this precious Sunday of potentially
life-changing self-improvement time which the week's hustle bustle won't intrude
into to make a sort of hail mary play. I took a big step yesterday externalizing
some code that had to be externalized in my FastHTML framework, setting the
stage for today's work. But I have to proceed with caution so as to not dive
headfirst into a rabbit hole that keeps me locked into the wrong adventure for
the rest of the weekend.

Articles like this are surveys of the landscape, and looking at my tools to help
me with next steps. But even this raises concerns in my potential growing
dependence on AIs to help me think through next steps. I need to dig deep and
find it within myself. And that's really the outcome of this article. By letting
out a teaser or a test-line to Grok 3 to see if it would step in with any real
mentorship, it doesn't.

While something more than auto-complete on steroids, today's AI frontier models
do not seem to be quite enough to replace the kind of skilled coach or educator
that the counter-arguments to Malcolm Gladwell's over-simplified 10,000-hours
rule say is necessary. Practice alone isn't enough. And even though I'd like to
replace the teacher/educator part with Grok 3 or the like, even they are not
enough. Not even with their fancy new Deep Research features.

However, they are good sounding walls. They are good for what developers call
***rubber ducking.*** But in its own way, even that is dopamine addicting, bias
confirming, and potentially even endeavor-derailing if you're not careful.
They're over-trained in some areas and under-trained in others. You'll notice
that Grok 3 thought FastHTML was my own framework despite a preponderance of
evidence otherwise, if it either had that trained-in or just looked.

Final word? Hmmm. My final word is that an article like this is good for
surveying the landscape, cleansing the mental palate, and achieving a good
starting-point for your own slightly improved, possibly directionally adjusted
agentic thinking of your own. Remember, agentic just means having agency. Making
decisions for yourself. Having some level of autonomy.

I still have some next-step thinking to do.
