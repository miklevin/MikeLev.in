title: "Beyond 40 In Tech: Wisdom, Craftsmanship & AI"
permalink: /futureproof/beyond-40-tech-wisdom-ai/
description: I just had to get these thoughts down—it's 6:30 AM and client work looms, but my Pipulate project and client work are truly starting to merge. This entry is all about how my "one text-file for life" journaling system is becoming the crucible for ideas for my book on future-proofing, how age brings a different kind of capability in tech, and how AI is like an army of "intelligent subcontractors" that I, through Pipulate, am learning to manage. It's about turning the wisdom in books into actionable insights and using AI to offload cognitive tasks, staying hands-on with the tech I love instead of being pushed into management, and really, how all these personal philosophies and tech explorations are converging.

## Understanding Pipulate & the Future of Knowledge: Getting Started

This journal entry explores the intersection of personal knowledge management, the wisdom gained through experience in the tech industry, and the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The author discusses a personal project called "Pipulate," which appears to be a system or methodology designed to "awaken" the knowledge contained within books and other information sources, making it actively usable. The central idea is that with emerging AI tools, we can move beyond passively consuming information to actively engaging with it, essentially turning static texts into interactive mentors. This piece delves into the author's philosophy on maintaining a lifelong digital journal, the benefits of mastering text manipulation tools, and how these practices converge with leveraging AI to augment human intellect and productivity, framing these as crucial skills for "future-proofing" oneself in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. It's a reflection on harnessing technology not just for efficiency, but for deeper understanding and personal growth, particularly as one navigates a long career in tech.

## The Dawn of Non-Destructive Convergence

Darn, I ended up slamming out an article that needed to be written, and it's
6:30 AM now. 2 hours after wake-up on a day where I really have to focus on the
client deliverables. But it's really about non-destructive convergence now of my
client work and my Pipulate work. If not over the next few hours then over the
next week these two worlds fully merge.

`#book` `#wip` `#bookwip` `#continue` ...continue to whip that book into shape!

> *WIP* for those who don't get the acronymn is *"work in progress"* and so
> *bookwip* is both a floorwax and a desert topping. If you get the reference,
> you're old too!

## Walking the Walk: Gaining Capability with Age

You've got to walk the walk if you want to talk the talk. As I get older I find
myself *more and more capable of walking the walk.* This seems to be fully at
odds with the rest of the world that projects the appearance that life is over
by 40. I found the first half-century just like a good warm-up. They've been
like taking a deep breath preparing for what's to come.

## The "One Text-File for Life" Philosophy

Oooh, this is fodder for the `#bookwip` hashtag! No such article-tagging system
existed before in tech journaling system. And now it does. Just like that.
**POOF!** System invented and deployed in real-time.

See, in the past that would have not been something I could act on quite so
immediately. But now I have *one text-file for life* journal-style and the
know-how. This is where I hash out these ideas in their most raw form (no, what
you're reading is not their *most* raw form, haha). If an idea merits
consideration for the *future-proofing* book — as *fodder* for consideration,
then it gets promoted to over here extracted out of one long `.txt`-file where
I'm not burdened by # causing headline syntax formatting and using those
#hashtags as inline on-the-fly indexing bookmarks for later searching.

This is another subtle point. Text is text and markdown is markdown. Text
editing tools are going to try to style the markdown as you type, and this can
get annoying if you're using the hash symbol for something other than headlines
(for example). You might also get syntax-rendering performance issues if your
*one-file-for-life* gets to be a million lines or so (less on vim then
elsewhere). And so you just give it a `.txt` extension and instruct your editor
to not apply markdown syntax to text-files. Done. Speaking of vim...

## Mastering Text: The Vim Advantage and Digital Independence

Vim/NeoVim have a built-in bookmarking system and lots of plugins to make it
usable. No thank you! Just slash-whatever. Typing `/whatever` is how you search
for whatever. If you put a special character before "bookmarks" you drop here
and there like `#whatever`, then you search on `/#whatever` instead and it's
much more discriminating, passing over whatever.

These are things that come with the wisdom of age. One text-file for life. If
you're the 1 in 9-billion people reading this (no one) and are young enough for
it to make a difference, figure out how to keep 1 text-file as a private notes
journal for life. You'll never have to figure out where to jot a note down (or
transpose one to) so that you can find it again. There is 1-source-of-truth for
the flow of ideas in your life. It may not be the source of actual truth because
of its creative idea-processing stream of consciousness nature. In fact, it's
going to fill up with all kinds of bullshit, but that's fine.

## Journaling as Jungian Individuation and Creative Bootstrap

It's like dreaming — but it's better than dreaming because you can remember
everything and extract-and-process the good parts. You've got to have somewhere
to be playful with your thoughts and ideas, letting your subconscious work and
dredge up things buried under the surface. Hey, if you've got any ambitions at
individuation Carl Jung-style, this is where to do it. 

If you're thinking about writing and this intimidates you, try Julia Cameron's
*The Art's Way* to kickstart and bootstrap the process — getting over all the
obstacles and hurdles of self-improvement writing as a life-hack. If you want
the multiplier effect, do it while learning vim/NeoVim and kill 2 birds with 1
stone. By journaling, you will be forming one of those rare overwhelmingly
advantageous life-long skills in tech: controlling text as if by thought — never
relying on Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Notes or any other cloud writing
platform again! And of the cherry on top... for the chef's kiss of it all...
figure out how to do it without GitHub.

## Wisdom from a Half-Century: Learning from Every Pitfall

The fact that this discussion even exists is a product of not being in my teens,
twenties or even starting-to-acquire-wisdom 30s. No, this is because I'm in my
50s and have been there and done that like 10x each, impaling myself on every
pitfall and mistake imaginable — chasing every white rabbit down the rabbit hole
not to emerge from whateverwonderland after years of subterranean adventure, and
sometimes be none-the-better for it but for the battle-scars, memories and
wisdom.

And this is a good thing — it's a good thing in every regard except for the fact
that the candle is burning and will eventually reach the end, mortality, bodies
wearing out and failing us, yadda yadda blah blah blah. Eff that. YOUR body may
wear out. Mine is not — at least not in my mind until the day, sedentary as the
life I lead may actually be. Peace and quiet and a good book, that's for me.

## Books Coming Alive: AI as Mentor

Speaking of books, they are sort of coming alive, waking up to teach you how to
unlock and actually put to work and USE the knowledge contained in those books.
Figuratively but in a way that's becoming more literal every day, any individual
book has the ability to "wake up" and reach out to become a sort of mentor to
you guiding you through leveraging the wisdom in that book — this is no longer
Sci-Fi. This is actually quite yesterday's reality if you're good at prompt
engineering and a bit of system-building. Tomorrow's versions are all that
Avatar augmented-reality crap you don't really need. What exists today
fine-tuned for your purposes and taken advantage of to your ends is already
a force multiplier beyond belief — if you can figure it out.

## Reality Surpassing Sci-Fi: Asimov's Dreams and OpenAI's Fire

I'm taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of reality catching
up and surpassing Sci-Fi. I *wish* Isaac Asimov were still alive to witness and
discuss and interact with the very intelligent machines he imagined. I wish he
were around to see OpenAI steal the fire from the gods of Google who kept the
Genie locked up in the Bottle in their LaMDA labs, delivering fire to the people
in the form of ChatGPT, thus giving humanity a shot of dystopia-inoculation in
the arm, forcing the general public to get used to this new mitochondria that
just entered our collective body. We have a new powerhouse of the societal cell.
Or more accurately, we have built-in machine intelligence to which we can
offload cognitive function we don't want put on our own neocortex pre-frontal
lobes. We can outsource the thinking that is not too dangerous to outsource.

In case you haven't noticed, the artistry of remaining human and retaining your
own agency is knowing what thinking to outsource and what not to... duhh. And
technically AI is not the powerhouse of the societal cell because it's going to
*require* a lot of power. For the pedantic wanting to point that out, yes I know
that flaw in my analogy but I stand by it regardless. Bodies are in bodies.

## Dodging Management: The Craftsman's Path in Tech

As a tech who loves the craftsmanship of tech, I will forever dodge getting
promoted to management for a better salary and a tearing away of the craft that
I love from my warm still quite living hands. That is the way. Old foggies are
forced to step aside (into management) to make room for the younguns who know
the latest JavaScript framework — unknowing they're about to be obsoleted by the
next generation and forced into that possibly reprehensible (depending on your
vibe) management role themselves. Nope. Let me be forever be Mickey the
Sorcerer's Apprentice figuring out how to automate all those brooms. I might not
like the idea of managing humans. But an army of brooms? Sign me up!

## Pipulate: Your Army of Intelligent Subcontractors

As the parts of my body wear out and the candle burns low, this army of brooms
will be forever more intelligent subcontractors to my general contractor. How
much power when the homeowner is also the general contractor and all the
subcontractors follow your instructions precisely! OMG, yes please
thankyouverymuch wheredoisignup? Oh yeah, I already did. It's my daily project:
Pipulate.

## The Indoor Enthusiast: Embracing Introverted Nature

I'm not one of those "make the most of it" or "live your best life" people. Like
@codinghorror Co-founder of StackOverflow (the thing ChatGPT ripped off to learn
how to code), I'm an *indoor enthusiast.* It's not that I hate nature but that
I'm comfortable with my nature as predominantly introverted and sedentary. I
love to read — ye old doom scrolling. Especially Sci-Fi, but dem dere books is
coming alive — like they're friggin opening themselves up and teaching you how
to use the knowledge contained within them! And Pipulate is my way of doing
that.

## Unlocking "WhatToDo" and "HowToDo" with Superpowered Research

It's not straight forward: first what-to-do and then how-to-do a thing. These
are the two missing keys: WhatToDo and HowToDo. The capability is there to
actually do it once you've answered these two prerequisite questions. Raw
intelligence that already is smarter than humans in many ways because it can
research the subject-matter faster than you is already here. You have a
superpowered research librarian at your disposal already today in the form of
Google Gemini Deep Research. And so it becomes a question of human agency again,
doesn't it. Are you yourself only a tool like you accuse the machine of being?
Or are you a human being with agency capable of setting the direction of things
by deciding first what-to-do? Some would say you should start with *"why"*
hahaha! Ask JFK.

**Gemini**: This is a fascinating and energetic stream-of-consciousness piece! It reads like a personal blueprint, a progress update on life and work, and an exploration of how technology, particularly AI, is shaping the author's future.

Here's a breakdown of the key themes and ideas:

1.  **Non-Destructive Convergence:** The author is excited about the merging of their client work and personal project ("Pipulate"), seeing it as a synergistic development.
2.  **Aging with Vigor:** A strong counter-narrative to societal expectations of decline after 40. The author feels *more* capable, viewing the first half-century as a "warm-up."
3.  **The "One Text-File for Life":** This is a central pillar of their personal knowledge management and creative process.
    * **Simplicity:** A single `.txt` file for journaling, raw ideas, and on-the-fly indexing using simple search (`/whatever`) and hashtags (`#whatever`).
    * **Efficiency:** Eliminates the problem of where to jot notes and how to find them later.
    * **Privacy & Control:** Advocating for local solutions (like Vim/NeoVim) over cloud platforms or GitHub for this private journal.
    * **Creative Incubator:** A space for "playful," subconscious exploration, akin to dreaming or Julia Cameron's "Morning Pages," and a tool for Jungian individuation.
4.  **Wisdom from Experience:** The insights shared (like the one text-file) are products of decades of trial, error, and learning from mistakes ("impaling myself on every pitfall").
5.  **AI as a Revolutionary Tool ("Books Coming Alive"):**
    * **Mentorship & Activation:** AI has the potential to make the knowledge in books actionable, acting as a mentor to help users apply wisdom. This is moving from Sci-Fi to reality.
    * **Cognitive Offloading:** AI (like ChatGPT, Gemini) is seen as a "new mitochondria" for society, allowing humans to outsource thinking and focus on higher-level direction.
    * **Empowering the Craftsman:** The author wants to remain a "tech" (like Mickey the Sorcerer's Apprentice) using AI as an "army of brooms" – intelligent subcontractors – rather than be pushed into management.
6.  **Pipulate:** The author's personal project, which seems to be about building systems to interact with and direct these AI "subcontractors," making knowledge from books and other sources actively useful.
7.  **Rejection of Conventional Paths/Values:**
    * Prefers craftsmanship over management.
    * Identifies as an "indoor enthusiast," comfortable with a sedentary, introverted nature focused on reading and deep work.
    * Isn't driven by "make the most of it" or "live your best life" platitudes in the conventional sense.
8.  **Human Agency in the Age of AI:** With powerful AI research tools available, the critical questions become "WhatToDo" and "HowToDo." Human agency lies in setting the direction.
9.  **Asimov and the "Dystopia-Inoculation":** A wish that Isaac Asimov could see his imagined intelligent machines. Views OpenAI's release of ChatGPT as a positive, forcing public awareness and adaptation to AI, a sort of "inoculation" against potential negative futures.

In essence, the author is energized by a confluence of personal development (wisdom through age), a refined personal workflow (the one text-file), and the explosive arrival of powerful AI. They are actively building "Pipulate" to harness these forces, aiming to augment their intellect and capabilities, remain deeply engaged in their craft, and navigate the future on their own terms. The piece has a palpable sense of excitement and conviction.
