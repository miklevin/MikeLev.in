Use Linux Command Line? Resist obsolescence? Future-proof?

What do you mean, Mike?

User interfaces change. The way we interact with computers changes.

This is different than the way we interact with the world. The world is relatively stable. You get to get better at things over time.

You see this in tools like the hammer. The hammer has been around for a long time. The way we use it doesn't change much. The hammer doesn't go from a dropdown menus to a ribbon to a hamburger menu to docking palates. Tabs don't switch from horizontal to vertical and keyboard shortcuts don't change between versions. A hammer is just a hammer.



Expertise amassed over a
decade or more can suddenly be
rendered obsolete by a new
version of software.

When's the last time a major
phone or OS upgrade made a
rough patch where you had to
re-learn all your habits? 

Say you were to keep a daily
journal. You'd want to be
able to read it in 10 years,
right? Where would you keep it?

A word processor on a laptop
which might crash? In a
Web-based word processor and
be beholden to a company?

Why should such basic ability
as writing have such strings
attached? It seems silly.
Writing should be like a
hammer. It should just work.

This is the primary reason I
advocate for the command line
interface. It's the most
stable interface we have.
