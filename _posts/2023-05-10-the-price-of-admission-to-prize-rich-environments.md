Create content at such a rate and of such a nature that it's irresistible and
irrepressible. There's an infinite spam cannon coming online, but that's really
just passive aggressive putting down of a process that lots of people are going
to be doing very well and that I'm already a bit jealous of already, as my
HitTail system from 2006 was so many of the things then that people are
building today. Take the output of a system and feed it back in as input, and
voila, content!

Back in those days, HitTail had to be a bit more manual, hiring writers to take
your primed and nearly guaranteed to work writing topic subject matter
(keywords) and work them into the headlines of well-optimized blog posts, and
you could pretty reliably and systematically bring in traffic. It was based on
the premise that something was always nearly working for you, and I produced
one of those off-the-wall early YouTube thingies so quaint and nostalgic today:

Well, that was a long, long, long time ago. And producing that was really me on
the decline from being at my prime and working my A-game, which I feel mostly
occurred in the halls of the most promising but ungrateful and misleading
places I ever worked, Scala. It's value ultimately was the friendships that
have lasted a lifetime, and the experiences for which there could be few better
terms than "war stories" to describe. 

Looking back I believe it was that very angst and having something to prove and
having my income tied to a variable revenue component that made me drive myself
so hard and bring out my A-game. I don't think it was all that mentally
healthy, and ultimately that's what drive me to New York City. If I was being
so moderately successful with brilliant A-game work whose very nature was to
overcome the opposition with which it was met, imagine what I could do in
friendly territory!

But nothing ever got that hostile again. It's just that my A-game was never
needed again. I was in positions where I perhaps needed to bring it out, but I
met someone, got married, had a kid, and the battles became on a different
front, the New York Co-op Board. Ugh! After awhile you realize it is you. You
are the problem. So, much soul-searching and self-improvement later, I'm
finally ready to get back to my A-game. I'm at MOZ. I have something to prove
again. To be in such a situation with a more abstract enemy and business goals
that everyone's actually rallying around, and me having the time to do it with
my kid much older, is a very exciting prospect.

I feel the energy crackling from my fingertips again, and with a much better
foundation of technology to base it on, and with the rise of AI as the swelling
wave beneath my surfboard, I'm ready to ride it. 

AI amplifies your already existing abilities, and all the more so for folks who
feel they were right at the cusp of something big, but never got to see it
through because of 1000 tiny cuts. AI is like the armor the tiny hatches
swinging at your ankles dull their blades on. I'm slapping on my shiny red
armor all equipped with Jarvis, and I'm ready to go to battle again.

Real enemies are bad. I once learned they were good from a book called Selling
The Dream by Guy Kawasaki. But I've learned that real enemies are bad. They
take your focus off of your real mission and your life. They don't deserve to
siphon off your energy, and their ability to do so is actually a win for them
and a loss for you. The person who originally brought me to New York City
taught me that. I was pretty fixed on the point of view that enemies were good
when I last discussed it with him, and I remember him shaking his head sadly
and me shrugging it off. I hear you, Adam. I haven't necessarily changed all
that much for consistency over time is a virtue, but I have changed my mind on
that one. Win them over, ignore them, or walk away from the situation.

Abstract enemies, now they're good. It's a survival thing. If you choose to
swim in the ocean, you're going to have to deal with sharks. The ability of
sharks to eat you is just something those with ambition must accept. It's
nothing personal between you and the shark, but it's the price of admission to
a prize-rich environment.
