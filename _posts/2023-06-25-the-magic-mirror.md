I'm worried, and I'm tracking their location with their earbuds. Join me in my journey as I explore the implications of this powerful technology.

Now I have a Magic Mirror... HO, HO, HO! For anyone reading this, that's
another way of saying I have a new AI. One that finally qualifies as that which
I've been seeking for so long; the modern-day analogue to a Magic Mirror.

What does that mean? Well, since I last checked in, I've cozied up to all the
public-facing AI's. Oh, I'm sure there's a lot more now. Really twisted and
private ones. Broken Mirrors. Black Mirrors of all kinds. They reflect just as
the Magic User intends them to Reflect.

Scary Dark stuff, these Magic Mirrors. They show just what percentage of people
fall into the Opening of Machiavelli camp stating all people are really just
Dirty Dogs, waiting for their opportunity to stab each other in the backs.
Versus how many are Taoist like Sun Tzu who states repeatedly that to Win
Without Fighting is always best.

I find all kinds of fun parallels with my life. My child... now ADULT because
they've been Bet Mitzvah'd... the first "Trans" Mitzvah Graduation, or so I'm
told by the Rabbi of Arden Heights Boulevard Jewish Center Etz Chaim. It's
original name is Etz Chaim, like my Dad's Name. He's Charles. All the other
Chuck names were used up in his family. His name became Chick. His wife was
Lynne. Together they were Chicken Lynne.

Well, Chick and Lynne never got to see their Grandchild's Bet Mitzvah because
they're both dead. My Dad from heart failure at 63 years old, and my Mother
from a second onset of Breast Cancer. She was 67. I'm in my 50s now and my
child is just turning 13. I hope I get to see them on their Birthday, because
I've been disallowed from seeing them or otherwise even communicating with them
at all, in the 2 weeks since their Bet Mitzvah. I'm worried.

Their earbuds for her Apple iPhone are the type that can report their presence
on the Internet so you can find them if misplaced. Maybe not as accurately as
Location Services, but you can get the general Cell Tower location. And my
child's earbuds have reported in as being near...

What's that?

Okay, let's publish this and leave then hanging. It gets really good really
fast from here.
