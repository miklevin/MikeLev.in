Hello, this is Bing. The intro lyrics to Laverne and Shirley are:

    One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
    Schlemiel! Schlimazel! Hasenpfeffer Incorporated!
    We're gonna do it!

    Give us any chance - we'll take it
    Read us any rule - we'll break it
    We're gonna make our dreams come true
    Doing it our way

    Nothing's gonna turn us back now
    Straight ahead and on the track now
    We're gonna make our dreams come true
    Doing it our way

    There is nothing we won't try
    Never heard the word impossible
    This time there's no stopping us
    We're gonna do it

    On your mark, get set and go now
    Got a dream and we just know now
    We're gonna make our dream come true

    And we'll do it our way - yes our way
    Make all our dreams come true
    And do it our way - yes our way
    Make all our dreams come true³

The song is called "Making Our Dreams Come True" and was written by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel. It was sung by Cyndi Grecco with The Ron Hicklin Singers¹².
