Last night was Movie Night with The Kid. The Kid is 11 years old, rapidly
approaching twelve. Movie nights of recent past have included movies of their
choosing, mostly Anime involving cats. Prior to that, I made sure I got in ET
and Back to The Future. Some movies are just too important to see in order to
understand ol' Dad, and I'd argue life in general, though as Lex Luthor says in
the Christopher Reeve Superman:

> Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple<br />
> adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper<br />
> and unlock the secrets of the universe.<br />
> <br />
> <cite>&#151;Lex Luthor, 1978</cite><br />

Yeah, the 1978 Superman is surely going on that list, as is the 1979 original
Muppet Movie that came out close on its heals. My 8 & 9 year-old years were
quite formative in my life with the type of suburban summer-camp my parents
were able to provide me, but which I was not able to provide my own child
through those years due to living in New York City and the divorce. Sighhhh.
Well, Christopher. Thank you for touching me and my life. Now you will touch my
child's. One never need lose their backbone, even if you are a stranger in a
strange land, and no matter what unfair knocks life deals you.

# Redemption & Refinement

Making good begins with Movie Night. As a result of a very strange request to
watch The Godfather given the non-stop references to it that exist in pop
culture. I totally jumped at the chance. I checked with the The Kid's mother
who was OK. So I made The Kid an offer they couldn't refuse: I'd sit and watch
the movie with them all the way through, and if it got too much for them, we
could stop it at any time. No strings attached. I wouldn't be asking for any
favors. It was a completely unconditional offer. Theory being that I'd lay down
some contrast between myself and the characters they're about to encounter...
check!

# A Tale of Three Court-Holders

Adi needed to see the court-holding personality types like Don Corleone, Lex
Luthor and my Uncle Bob doing their ring-kissing thing. Favors for favors.
Court-holding. By contrast, there are no conditions or strings attached when it
comes to your good 'ol dad, except where I can't help it due to financial
constraints or responsible parenting (which is a problem when it comes to
getting them to clean their room). Oooh, ooh!  Karate Kid... go add that to the
list!

So The Kid made it up to the horse-head in the bed scene and sort of tuned out.
Good. They don't need the whole epic and sad story of Michael Corleone... yet.
Suffice for them to be in a position to compare & contrast the Michael Corleone
they just met with the Mike Levin they've known for a lifetime. Just when I
thought I was out, they pull me back in!

# Carrie On There's Nothing To See Here

We don't need no stinkin' endings. Anyhoo, last night was Mean Girls. Important
lessons? Soft blue Yin personalities covet and can easily get sucked into hard
Yang (high school) cliques. Ugh! Ouch. Moaaaaan. My high school bully stories,
while not as bad as Stephen King's Carrie, did end in a couple of deaths. Frank
Sessa who tagged me with the nickname "AIDS victim" drove me out of my middle
school lunch-table and taught me who my friends were, which were very much
***not*** the people of my Synagogue culture. He fell down some steps and died.
No connection.

Happily, and happily right up to this day, I found true friendship in a true
Israeli who toughened me up and taught me to laugh, Guy Bruchstein. Thank you,
Guy! And thank you Howard Gorchov as well. I missed Howard at the 30-year high
school reunion (he moved to New York too), but I caught up with Guy and we
laughed at Jordan Robinson and Ira... something-or-ohter... both sipping wine
and obviously looking down at everyone, judging. But then so was I (projection,
much haha!). Oh and that Kevin-what's-his-face is still a bombastic showboating
clown. I never held it against him, but I love hearing Guy point it out. He
says what he thinks. Guy Bruchstein has been my Guy Gardner.

Oh, I love Guy. Thank you, again.

But I digress. The lesson of Mean Girls is resoundingly that:

# Lessons Regarding True Vibes & Friendship

- Deep Yin spirits (Cady) covet Shallow Yang spirits (Regina & the plastics)
- In that coveting, Yin's unnecessarily devalue true friendship (Janis &
  Daniel)
- Lessons learned on the "hero's journey" (making mistakes) is still somehow
  worth it... you're maybe better off for having had the journey
- Real friends will let you come back to them

# Lessons Regarding Strategy & Capability

- Stepping back and thoughtfully strategizing is a real thing (Janis at the
  blackboard)
- Sometimes you have to become an enemy to defeat an enemy (Cady becoming
  Regina)
- In doing so, you can readily "lose yourself" obsessing & over-relating (Cady
  becoming too obsessed over Regina)
- If you do fall in that trap, you are never too far gone to come back (Janis
  and Daniel ***WILL*** forgive you, if ***you*** prove yourself a ***dynamic
  personality*** who can learn, grow and be humble.

# From Movie Night to Stories Around Campfire Night

There's so many other good things to say about Mean Girls, I neither know where
to begin nor care to do so. Let's move on. Besides movies, there's other
critical media of the reading-variety I'd love Adi to wrap their mind around. I
think they need to read, or at least hear the Audible performances of:

- Call of The Wild (the Man in The Red Sweater, in particular)
- Moby-Dick (the relationship between Ishmael & Queequeg)
- The Diamond Age (the best modern Alice / Dorothy coming of age SciFi)

# Coming of Age Movies

I'm sure there's others, but these are the three that pop right to mind. My
Alice/Dorothy/Harry Potter coming-of-age stories are something of an obsession,
as I feel I never quite got over that phase of growth in myself. In fact the
fact I'd even think to state it that way is a problem in our society. One
should never "get over" coming of age stories. One should always and forever
remain a dynamic personality. And so:

- Jumanji (the Robin Williams original one for static/dynamic personality)
- Superman (The Christopher Reeves one for too many reasons to enumerate here)
- The Muppet Movie (Following your dreams, despite the Waldorf and Statler's)
- Karate Kid (Mr. Miyagi and the muscle-memory of wax-on/wax-off... foundational!)
- Goonies (Never properly saw it myself, but the need has been pounded into me)
- Heathers (the natural follow-on to Mean Girls and a segue to Moby-Dick)

# Become Dynamic or Parrish

Again, I could probably go listing movies for movie-night forever. Suffice to
say, these get across the next deep learnings The Kid must internalize. Jumanji
shows how people get trapped in their own minds (or games, fantasies, youtubes,
etc.) and become at risk of becoming ***adult-children***, stuck frozen in time
and never growing and enjoying the benefits of adulthood&#151;namely, freedom
from anxiety by virtue of ***knowing better***.

![Robin Williams As Alan Parrish In Jumanji](/assets/images/robin-williams-as-alan-parrish-in-jumanji.jpg)

Getting frozen in a dissociative child-like state is I believe the source of
crippling modern anxiety. If you can't grow up, this disabled
***adult-children*** learn how to manipulate the other, more capable adults
around them just like a crybaby having all your needs fulfilled by having it
brought to you. This is what the online community of narcissists mean when they
talk about narcissistic supply. It's a baby-wants-their-bottle sort of thing.
Or more accurately:

> Baby want want their loophole?<br />

Otherwise, you'll just leach off of other people your entire life, learn to
project an image of dignity, but really have imposter syndrome all your life,
hollow inside, and ready collapse under any sort of challenge&#nbsp;but not
until after threatening to rain hellfire from the sky in empty gestures of
"Karen" posturing.

My child needs to have their eyes opened to people choosing to live this way
and to be better than doing that for themselves. Getting trapped in your games
of your own mind (Jumanji) without a certain outward-looking mindfulness and
awareness of the objective world and how to make it on your own without relying
on a surrogate parent to bottle-feed you, or else  *BAM*, **you perish**... uh,
I mean you're Alan Parrish.

Happily, Alan Parrish in the end turned out to be a dynamic personality and
escaped the feedback-loophole of his own mind. All's well that ends well...
another important Movie Night lesson.

Thank you, and R.I.P, Robin Williams. I love you. You're definitely on a lot of
Movie Night choices.

# Thank You EVERYONE Involved in 1978 Superman! Thank You!

Regarding Superman, I'll stick to my guns. Too many reasons this is a must-see
to enumerate, suffice to say: Otisburgh (which I incorrectly called Otisville
in prior videos). Global warming, second chances, true importance, deep
channeling and parallels in the life of the actors... I'm choking up just
thinking about it. Excuse me while I go blow my nose.

# Know But Beware The Dark Recesses Of The Mind

And finally, Heathers. My kid took an immediate liking to Edgar Alan Poe. Good
Philadelphian, Adi. I'm proud of you. And I'm extra proud that you can recite
the first verse of The Raven. And yes, people were a lot harder to scare back
then. But if you want a modern Telltale Heart, you can't do much better than
Heathers, especially as a follow-on to Mean Girls. Oh, this is going to be
powerful. And I get the extra bonus of the highlighting of passages of
Moby-Dick, which I strongly feel I will transition to in dramatic readings
around the final campfires here in the Pocono mountains this June last month of
our experience here as a character straight out of such stories yanks us back
to where the air in stinky and the expenses are crippling.

# Framing? Okay, Sure, Framing.

Think deeply, My Child. Think deeply. Yes, while this is framing&#151;it is
framing such that you think for yourself with the aid of writers and authors
and master storytellers (I ***will not*** stop using the word "master"). It is
the role of your father, of ***Good Ol' Dad***, to rough-house with your mind
right along with your body to inoculate you against the frail fragility of
bitter brittle prattling prima donnas of the world. They will empower your
pathology. They do not want you to be well. There is nothing I can say or do
that will teach you this better than the story-telling masters can.

I will instill in you a love of reading. Terrible labels! Just that phrase has
the opposite effect of closing avenues of the mind, clamping shut the
open-mindedness of a child with the tedium of chores and lessons. Ugh! The
tyranny of language! Math... that's another. Math lessons are the same in any
country... is that not powerful Channeling of the True Spirit of Math by Cady
Heron of Mean Girls? Cady, pronounced Katie and not Catty... get it, kid? Get
it? Katie becomes Catty to content with Regina who's a catty predator!

Well, if you liked Mean Girls, you're gonna love Heathers. It goes dark in just
the way you like to see, channeling the spirit of Edgar Alan Poe. It will call
out to your inner Philadelphian. Think in extremes, but act in moderation. Just
because your mind can go there doesn't mean your body has to. But media lets
your mind go there. Entertain the fantasy, but maintain a sharp line of
demarcation. Learn from the fantasy. Be able to weight the consequences of
making the worst decisions possible in life without having to suffer those
consequences except in the freedom and imagination of your mind.

# Empathy & Compassion Always Win Over Fear & Anxiety

Compassion is a survival trait. Anxiety, and teenage ***"angst"*** by
extension, is an out-of-whack survival trait. The need for empathy and
compassion persists. The need to strike out with deadly force over minor
altercations and dark fanciful whims does not. The Telltale Heart will do you
in. You can't suppress your more noble inner human. And I'll stop there because
I may be remembering Heathers totally wrong.
