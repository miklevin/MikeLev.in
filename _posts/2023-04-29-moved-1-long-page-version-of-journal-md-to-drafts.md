We chip away at things. However, that's assuming we're not backsliding and
losing progress, in which case you don't necessarily have the luxury of
sculpting, and have to look at other tactics. Sometimes, you take sweeping
80/20-rule passes at a thing.

I've worked hard to make sure there was something that couldn't be taken away
from me. And it's a cross-cutting skill. What doesn't involve data? Now I just
need to get down my ways of... what? I want to relate it to work more. If I
took the 1-long-page version of this journal.md out of Github publishing space,
into say draft space, then I could leave posts unpublished here merely by not
giving them a yaml title.

The system automatically knows where to look for other things relative to the
location of the file that's sent on the macro. No problem! I can just make the
new location in `_drafts` conventional. Do that... Okay, done. This is one of
those cases where a program location referred to by my `all` program is
changed, and that's tricky because when I switch marines, I want to pull the
vim repo and put the new all program in location before running it.

I just have to remember that I changed something in `all` and that's a flag for
me when switching machines. Let me do that right now for practice...

Okay there, done. Trickier than I thought. A few constants had to be updated,
namely PATH. But a full publish just occurred after switching machines. Things
are settling into place. I've can hardly remember making so much progress in so
little time. The latest work lets me write posts like this and just keep them
unpublished entirely, because previously even before you gave a post a title
allowing it to be sliced & diced, it was still published in its nearly unusable
long-page version. Nearly unusable because of all the YouTube embeds. Aside
from those, really long pages can load pretty well into browsers, but are still
not a great idea being such an edge case as they are.

Okay so now journal.md's optionally belong in the Jekyll system's `_drafts`
folder, where it belongs, I guess. Okay, use these folders for what they're
intended. 

This is really quite enough to cut the post.
