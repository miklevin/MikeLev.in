title: Visualizing Change is Projecting Epigenetic Templates
headline: "Exploring Particles, Fractals, and Epigenetics: Uncovering the Power of Design in Our DNA"
description: As a YouTuber, I am exploring the idea that particles have memories, self-similarity is found throughout because of fractals, and that our DNA contains 3.2 billion base-pairs of amino acids. I am amazed by the implications of epigenetics and the power to shape ourselves and our environment. I'm also fascinated by the idea of life having a way of returning to the center, no matter what. Join me as I explore these ideas.

I am the hard-to-discover on YouTube, and once discovered even harder to
follow, for you see, I follow no particular formula and I despise editing. Yes,
in part this is because I am lazy and do not want to write scripts and master
more tools destined to change on me. I like my tools unchanging and not
charging me the privilege of $100/year just for the option of using it. Adobe
Premiere is most decidedly not my vibe, even if I were to love it upon giving
it a chance. No thank-you. I'll take the under-featured video editor built into
Blender any day over that. Better yet, there should just be a way of editing
after the fact. Edit-after-publish by which you continuously refine your
content, or allow others to do so for a cut of the revenue.

If remote viewing is really a thing, how would one break their way into the
scene? If the universe can play back for entertainment value, how would you
make yourself a playback hotspot? And would you really even want to? What if
you were everybody and everybody were you, in both a human and all-life-forms
perspective? What if one day you'll know what it is to be a rock or whatever?
Shifting perspectives and form of consciousness based on what your molecules
have been a part of during the epochs. What if every persistent particle-like
thing has a memory of everything it's been a part of, entangled with?

What if the purpose of every particle is to live a life in this material world
with its own sort of consciousness like what we have but at a particle scale?
Isn't that the self-similarity principle? If self-similarity is found
throughout because fractals, then what's self-similar to humans and other
sentient beings? A particle? A galactic cluster (galaxies seem too simple)?
Probably everything's a neuron in some cosmic consciousness. Neurons don't know
they're neurons. I heard that said recently.

Okay, I'm clearly on the verge of something here. Just add blogroll. Evolve
skite into a self-publishing slice & dicer that lets you hold back your vim
journals selectively. Know that what you're using for yourself daily habit-wise
with vim is appealing to others. I'm bringing a sort of structure and
self-determinism to my life that's the sought-after thing by many people: a
no-strings-attached system for processing your thoughts.

Shifting perspective occasionally is important. I should remind people of that.
Coming up with new baselines. Opening your mind to new first principles.
Axioms. Assumptions. Tenants. Call them what you will, but we all live our
lives based on them, generally instilled into us by our parents and society. We
see things from the viewpoint we were born into, modified only by random
emergent properties from recombinant DNA. Sexual reproduction is one of
evolution's big tricks try out new ideas. The purpose of sexual reproduction is
to try out new ideas. Think about that.

We've all got a "vibe" and our most "core" hardware-vibes are expressed by our
DNA, and the DNA passed directly down to us by our parents through genetic
reshuffling. That's the combined information of about 3.2 billion base-pairs of
amino acids that double-helix up to form our DNA and the ultimate product so
far of evolution. It's got a lot in there. An awful lot more in fact than we're
expressing. Through variable gene-expression alone, our original hardware-DNA
could lead to infinite variation in single-instance expression. We are all
unique, if for genetic expression reasons alone.

It's not all gills and tails. Gene expression can manifest in lots of subtle
ways like general health. Circumstance plays a large role tool. You're born
into a situation in which your natural genetic traits are either advantageous
or not. Your strengths may be identified and valued by society at an early age
and nurtured and a sense of belonging and self-worth contributes to lower
stress and worry and a longer life. Genes express themselves or not in reaction
to your experiences and environment. Epigenetics. Almost unbelievable in its
implications for life.

It is quite possible that we shape ourselves, you should know. Our genetics
projects a sort of template-design to which some very flexible life-machinery
attaches and figures out a way. Listen to modern-day Frankenstein Michael Levin
(a different one) talk about scrambling developing frog-faces that
self-correct. By whatever means, life somehow provides rails with strong
return-to-center behavior baked-in.

Designs are information, are they not? That epigenetic template that a
scrambled frog reorders itself into is encoded somewhere and somehow, is it
not? An actual 3D-esque design is encoded into the DNA. Is the image of a frog
not in a frog's DNA? Is the image of you not in your DNA? If not, then what? Is
there some level of sentient awareness where simply looking at a lifeform's DNA
reveal what sort of being it is?
