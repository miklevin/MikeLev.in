description: As a He/Him living in Staten Island, NYC, I live by the motto 'What's Most Broken, Where's The Biggest Bang for The Buck, What Plates Need Spinning'. My life is centered around my kid, Linux, Python, vim & git, and daily reading & writing. If I were to participate in an eating contest, Blue Cheese & Skittles would be my choice. I've experienced some truly magical moments.

What are your pronouns? He/Him

Where are you located? Staten Island, New York City

Personal Motto/Mantra/Favorite Quote:

That would be my daily process:

- What's Most Broken
- Where's The Biggest Bang for The Buck
- What Plates Need Spinning

Name three things you canâ€™t live without:

- My kid (12 & growing up fast)
- Linux, Python, vim & git (fad-resistant FOSS)
- Daily reading & writing (SciFi, Journaling, Blogging)

If you were to participate in an eating contest, what food would you want for your challenge?

- Blue Cheese & Skittles

What is the most magical thing that has ever happened to you?

This chained-up series of events:

- Born within miles & months of Unix
- Student intern for Commodore computers
- Move to NYC to be VP of PR firm that launched Amazon.
- Created a Web 2.0-era app HitTail that had 15 year run.
- Gradual discovery/embracing of love-worthy tech tools
- Leading to today with "magical charge" at maximum.

What excites you the most about this new position?

SEO is undergoing the largest changes in decades, between AI and more powerful
than ever FOSS tools in the hands of individuals. The iron is hot to alter
perceptions and to shape and define a new emerging field.
