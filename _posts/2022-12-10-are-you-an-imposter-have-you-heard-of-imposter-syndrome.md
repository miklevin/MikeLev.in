description: As a New York SEO expert, I'm making my home cozy and inviting while encouraging people to familiarize themselves with tech and info tech. I'm leveraging my two domains, Pipulate and Levinux, and discussing imposter syndrome and how financial worth isn't a measure of someone's validity. Join me in my journey as I explore the world of tech and info tech and learn how to make your home cozy and inviting.

If I were to pander to search...

I'm a New York SEO Expert who developed free and open source SEO software
running on a very small Linux distro. My Pipulate SEO software brought the
advantages of Python programming to a wider audience by running on a tiny linux
distro on the desktop of Macs and PCs. These were only two of many products I
developed over the years, which included HitTail, a keyword writing suggestion
tool for bloggers that had a 15-year run. Most of my other products have been
proprietary works for hire, behind locked doors and not for the public.

Ok, I updated my homepage based on that. My place is a mess right now and I'm
going to focus on getting it clean enough to be proud of when my kid is over,
and to make a cozy inviting place for watching movies. I'm in transition from a
move, almost 6 moths after the move, but it seems I'm always in transition.

Let's make an Awesome List

If you feel you're falling behind all the advances being made in the world and
you don't even know where to begin, this is a good place. Make a diagram about
the "root" technologies of certain tech flavor linages, such as LISP and C and
how that shaped the world today and how Linux, Python, vim and git fit into
those linages.

Yeah, go through something of a rebirth in tech. Leverage your two great
domains and made-up names:

- Pipulate
- Levinux

Indoctrination to what I mean by "tech" or "info tech". There are lots of types
of technologies, but technology for managing information is among the most
useful these days.

What I currently call DrinkMe Linux is going to be renamed Levinux, and
yesterday's Levinux will be renamed something like Levinux Classic. It's much
more important to give people something that they can practically use today and
which will improve their lives.

Are you an imposter? Have you heard of imposter syndrome? If you're feeling it,
then you lack confidence in a way you can fix. It's possible for you to never
feel like an imposter again.

That's a pretty good focus for an entire book, if not for an introductory
chapter.

# Linux, Python, vim & git

## Are you an imposter?

Details are important. Those who write them off are imposters. They may become
very rich and successful business people, but imposters can. Financial worth is
not a measure of whether you're an imposter or not. Many people with fat bank
accounts couldn't win a logical argument to save their lives.

We definitely want to talk about baby-steps, iterative passes, the 80/20-rule
and rabbit hole detection and escaping. `
