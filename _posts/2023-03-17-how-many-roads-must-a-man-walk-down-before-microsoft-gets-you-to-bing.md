Through attrition, Microsoft's going to get you to yield to default search and
cry Uncle and leave your browser defaults set to Edge and Bing.

- Have you bought a new laptop?
- Have you done a major system upgrade?

Well then your browser defaults just got reset to Microsoft Edge!

It's time to install Chrome, right? Well what if the default is just as good as
Chrome because it's based on the same Google-provided free and open source
Chromium, but also has all the might of Microsoft going into better features
like full-screen snapshots, grouped tabs and the like. Sure, Chrome catches up
eventually, But Microsoft's in the lead here just like with ChatBots and AI. So
it only makes sense than once you give Edge a chance, all roads lead to Bing.

So you're using Edge and you type something into the address bar that's not
exactly a URL, what happens these days? How may things might you click that
leads to a Bing chat, intentionally or not? Let's take a look:
