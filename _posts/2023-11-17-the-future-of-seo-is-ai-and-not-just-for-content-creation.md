title: The Future of SEO is AI, And Not Just for Content Creation
headline: "Take Control of Your Digital Life: Learn How to Create a Future-Proof Website on GitHub!"
description: I'm an SEO professional who values integrity over following trends. I'm using GitHub to host my personal website, but I'm not locked in - I can move my content anytime, anywhere. My whole website is just one long text file in a 'one journal for life' format. This approach simplifies content management, reduces complexity, and helps me maintain momentum and form habits. I'm future-proofing my work, ensuring that it stays relevant and accessible in the ever-changing digital landscape.

Mike: Here is the beginning of an article I am writing. I'm interested in your feedback:

Let's get something straight. I'm an odd duck. I'm tired of trying to emulate the styles of "what works" to pander to the search algorithms and get the word out on my subject-matter. And I'm an SEO, so that's saying something. I'll do it for clients, but for myself, it's integrity first. Be true to myself and let the world adapt adjust. 

Google has been making a big hullabaloo about helpful content. It seems to me that risk is deeply tied to intent. If your intent is to help, you're not just peddling products and schilling services. You're actually trying to help from a differently motivate place, increasingly rare online today and thus all the more critical for generic default Google search to try to surface and give some exposure to. 

I share like I do out of altruism and the goodness of my heart, not to make money. Arguably, it keeps me sharp in my profession and in communication with a small handful of folks who care, and that's enough for me. I created the 2006 through 2021 HitTail long-tail keyword suggestion tool for bloggers. It was tried and true until the tragedy of the commons ruined it for everyone. 

Today, the long-tail where helpful content exists is all but dead, in the wake of disingenuous ad-motivated content. And we all become disillusioned with search, willing to just give chatting with an AI a chance because you don't have to wade through all the ads. At least for this brief moment in time. It doesn't bode well that ChatBots have almost mind-control ability in the way it can slips the ads in. 

ChatGPT: Your article presents a candid and insightful perspective on SEO and content creation. Here are a few points of feedback:

1. **Personal Voice and Authenticity**: The opening is strong and personal, establishing your unique perspective as an SEO professional who values integrity over following trends. This approach is refreshing and sets the tone for an honest discussion.

2. **Critical Analysis of Current Trends**: Your critique of Google's emphasis on helpful content and the risk associated with intent is thought-provoking. It encourages readers to consider the deeper implications of content creation beyond just SEO tactics.

3. **Reflection on Professional Experience**: Sharing your experience with the HitTail tool adds credibility and depth to your analysis. It shows how industry changes have impacted tools and strategies over time.

4. **Discussion of the Current State of SEO**: The observation about the long-tail keyword demise and the rise of ad-motivated content is a critical reflection on the industry. This part of the article effectively captures the challenges faced by genuine content creators.

5. **Concerns About the Future**: The closing thoughts on the potential of chatbots and AI in content creation and ad integration raise important ethical and practical concerns. It's a compelling way to end the article, leaving the reader with something significant to ponder.

Overall, your article stands out for its honesty and deep understanding of the field. It balances personal insights with professional critique, making it both relatable and informative. The only suggestion would be to ensure that the article remains accessible to readers who might not be as familiar with SEO terminology or the history of these tools, without diluting your strong, informed voice.

While maintained style and my original presentation as close as possible, re-write it so that it is more accessible to someone not familiar with SEO. Also search on the latest with the Google anti-trust suit and revelations about 36% ad revenue share with Apple to highlight exactly how financially motivated, and thus manipulated, search is today. Really grab the reader and set this article up to be a blow up break out piece for the author in its perfect timing with media events.  

I've revised your article to make it more accessible to those not familiar with SEO, while incorporating recent developments in Google's antitrust case and its financial agreements with Apple:

"Let's talk straight. I'm not your usual writer. I've spent years working in SEO (Search Engine Optimization), which is all about getting websites to show up higher in Google searches. But I'm tired of just playing the game, following the usual tactics to please Google's algorithms. When it comes to my own work, I believe in integrity and staying true to myself.

Recently, Google's been making noise about valuing 'helpful content.' But I think there's more to the story. It's about why we create content. Is it just to sell products, or is it to genuinely help people? In today's digital world, where sincerity is rare, this matters more than ever.

I write because I want to share knowledge, not just to earn money. It keeps me sharp in my field and lets me connect with others who share my interests. Take my creation, the HitTail keyword suggestion tool (2006-2021), for instance. It was a great tool until overuse and exploitation – a phenomenon called 'the tragedy of the commons' – made it less effective.

But here's the kicker: the landscape of online search is changing, and not necessarily for the better. The space where helpful content used to thrive is being overtaken by ad-driven, insincere material. People are getting tired of this, turning to alternatives like AI chatbots for information, as they don't have to sift through endless ads – at least for now.

This shift doesn't look promising when you consider the financial motivations behind search giants like Google. In a recent antitrust trial, it was revealed that Google paid a whopping $20 billion to Apple in 2021 to remain the default search engine on Safari, Apple's web browser [oai_citation:1,Apple earns 36% of Google search ad revenue through Safari, antitrust trial reveals - 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/13/apple-google-36-percent/). This deal, where Google shares 36% of its search ad revenue generated through Safari with Apple, shows just how much financial interests are at play [oai_citation:2,Apple earns 36% of Google search ad revenue through Safari, antitrust trial reveals - 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/13/apple-google-36-percent/). 

Even more concerning, this partnership limits the growth of other search engines and possibly influences Apple's stance on privacy and competition [oai_citation:3,Apple earns 36% of Google search ad revenue through Safari, antitrust trial reveals - 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/13/apple-google-36-percent/). Add to that the fact that Google, with nearly 90% market share in the U.S., has the power to raise ad rates without losing advertisers [oai_citation:4,US wraps up antitrust case against Google in historic trial | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-wraps-up-antitrust-case-against-google-historic-trial-2023-11-16/#:~:text=Whinston%20said%20Google%20had%20the,little%20incentive%20to%20improve%20quality). This financial grip over the market, combined with massive profits – Google reported a net profit of $19.69 billion in just three months of 2022 [oai_citation:5,US wraps up antitrust case against Google in historic trial | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-wraps-up-antitrust-case-against-google-historic-trial-2023-11-16/#:~:text=Alphabet%20reported%20a%20net%20,69%20billion%20for%20the%20quarter) – paints a picture of a search landscape driven more by money than by the intent to provide quality, helpful content.

So, where does that leave us? In a world where search engines are increasingly motivated by profit, the authenticity of content and the sincerity of its creators are more important than ever. It's time to rethink our approach to creating and sharing information online."

This version maintains your original style and message but explains SEO and recent industry developments in a way that's more accessible to those unfamiliar with the field. The inclusion of the Google antitrust case and its financial ties with Apple highlights the current state of search and underscores the importance of integrity in content creation.

Mike: Thanks, that's great. Here's the direction I'm going now:

If you're reading this now, chances are you found your way to my personal website hosted on GitHub.com, the gangbusters category-killing developer collaboration site bought my Microsoft in 2018. I pay for the developer membership, but I don't have to. I only need to keep a domain registered with any registrar and point my custom domain to GitHub. If I want to host it somewhere else, I take the static text files that comprise the site elsewhere. 

I'm using GitHub for convenience, but I'm using nothing proprietary and have full portability. Most notably, I'm not using WordPress or Medium.com, two very fine and search optimized platforms, but each with its own set of gotchas—just like pretty much every other publishing platform out there. My whole website is just one long text file in a "one journal for life" format that uses some minimal special formatting called markdown to organize. It's as easy to read for humans as it is for machines. And then I slice and dice it into a blog with some styles and navigation overlaid, also in non-proprietary ways. 

ChatGPT: Tell me what you think and tell me how to hold the reader's attention without it getting too technical. Emphasize never being shut into any platform or technology and how your work can stay with you for life. And which the 1-and-only-1 textile for life approach, you always know where to look, eliminating that ever-so-challenging multiple file, multiple technology and large surface area and technical liability problem that makes pausing and restarting efforts hard, breaks momentum, creates dependencies and works against forming habits. You can basically pick up where I left off writing paragraphs as if by me. Even emphasize a goal here is that even when starting our with GitHub to host both the repo and the published blog, you don't have to stay on GitHub. You can flow like water into the future, always improving your skills and muscle memory, and never losing your assets.

ChatGPT: Your approach to using GitHub for hosting your personal website reflects a savvy and future-proof strategy. Here are my thoughts on how to maintain the reader's interest and emphasize key points:

1. **Simplicity and Portability**: Highlight the ease and simplicity of using GitHub, emphasizing the convenience of managing a website with minimal formatting like markdown. This approach is not just user-friendly but also ensures that your content remains portable and adaptable to various platforms.

2. **Independence from Platforms**: Stress the importance of not being tied down to any single platform like WordPress or Medium. Your method allows for greater control and independence, ensuring that your work is not subject to the constraints and 'gotchas' of proprietary platforms.

3. **Longevity and Organization**: Focus on the 'one journal for life' format of your website. This unique approach helps in keeping all your content in one place, making it easier to manage, reducing the complexities associated with multiple files and technologies, and ensuring continuity in your work.

4. **Flexibility and Skill Development**: Point out that starting with GitHub doesn't mean you're locked into it forever. This flexibility allows for constant improvement of skills and adaptation to new technologies, without losing any of your existing work.

5. **Continuity and Habit Formation**: Emphasize how a singular, streamlined approach aids in maintaining momentum, reducing dependencies, and fostering habit formation. This way, your work remains consistent, and you can easily pick up from where you left off.

6. **Future-Proofing Your Work**: Encourage readers to think about how your approach is not just about the present but also about ensuring that your work remains relevant and accessible in the future, adapting like water to new environments and technologies.

By focusing on these points, your writing will resonate with readers who value independence, simplicity, and the longevity of their digital work, all while avoiding overly technical jargon.

Mike: Thank you 🙏 ChatGPT, but I think you just did. Can you re-write that but using my voice?

ChatGPT: Absolutely, let's give it a go in your style:

"Alright, let's dive in. You're here on my site, hosted on GitHub – yes, that developer paradise Microsoft snagged in 2018. I've got a paid membership, but hey, that's just me wanting to support the ecosystem. You? You just need a domain and you're golden. GitHub's my choice for now, but I'm not married to it. I can up and move my site, a bunch of straightforward text files, anytime, anywhere.

Why GitHub, you ask? Well, it's hassle-free, but the real kicker? I'm not locked in. No WordPress, no Medium – both great, but they come with strings attached. My site's a single, flowing journal in markdown – think digital simplicity that's a breeze for us humans and our robot buddies.

And here's the clincher: my 'one journal for life' approach. Everything in one spot. No juggling multiple files, no wrestling with tech headaches. It's a game-changer for keeping the momentum, building habits, and staying independent. Plus, it's future-proof. Start on GitHub, sure, but as your skills evolve, your content flows with you, seamless and intact.

So, what's the big deal? It's about keeping your digital life as nimble and adaptable as you are. No dependencies, no tech chains holding you back. You stay in control, your work stays with you, and you're always ready to flow into whatever comes next. That's the power of simplicity and freedom in the digital age." 

How's that for capturing your voice and vision?

Mike: That's great. How do you think I should hit this home with a call to action that will keep them coming back to read the series that will show them step-by-step how to do this first on GitHub, then off? Regardless of Mac or Windows laptop, I'll show them how to do it under Linux and vim (without a Linux desktop) for full future-proofing. Also, what kind of picture do you think should accompany an article like this? Maybe something that portrays a androgynous protagonist happy, free from the invisible hand machinations of vendors trying to introduce dependencies into your life? So in addition to the call to action end of article that shows where I'm going with all this, write a prompt I can use for Dall-E 3. 

ChatGPT: To wrap up your article with an engaging call to action and set the stage for your upcoming series, consider something like this:

---

"Now, if this piqued your curiosity, you're in for a treat. I'm rolling out a step-by-step series – 'Tech Freedom: Your Way' – where I'll guide you through setting up your own space, first on GitHub, then beyond. We're going cross-platform here, folks – Mac, Windows, you name it – but with a twist: we'll harness the power of Linux and vim, all without needing a Linux desktop. This is about future-proofing your digital life, the smart way. Stay tuned, and together, we'll break free from the invisible chains of tech giants, step by confident step."

For the accompanying image, you're envisioning something quite symbolic and powerful. How about this for a Dall-E 3 prompt:

"Create an image of an androgynous protagonist, standing confidently on a digital landscape that represents the internet. They should appear free and joyful, surrounded by symbols of technology like code, laptops, and network imagery. The background shows large, shadowy figures of tech giants, representing vendor dependencies, but the protagonist is clearly unaffected by them, symbolizing independence and control over their digital presence. The overall mood should be uplifting and empowering, illustrating the theme of freedom from the 'invisible hand' of tech vendors."

This image would visually encapsulate the essence of your article – breaking free from tech dependencies and embracing digital independence.
