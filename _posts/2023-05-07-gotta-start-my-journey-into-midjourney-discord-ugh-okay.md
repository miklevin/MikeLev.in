Well, as much as I don't like to rely on a Discord server for AI images, it's
shaping up to be a Midjourney image world, so it's time to start my Midjourney
journey. Already have an account from ages ago. Is it in the Microsoft Store?
Yup, okay installed. But also it forced me to verify my IP from email and
opened up a login in my browser. Guess it's like Slack in that regard. Web UI
or app, doesn't matter. Step 1 done.

If I want to go the paid account route, there's this [account link](https://www.midjourney.com/account)
