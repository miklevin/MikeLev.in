Start writing a story in which this is something truly original, I realize that and design a test along the line of Bell's Inequality, and I design a puzzle that will test it by being run in a variety of so-called quantum computers. The puzzle exists well in advance of sophisticated enough quantum computers to test it, but it is evident to everyone examining the puzzle that it's results as correlated across different versions of quantum computers as they come online will be as insightful and more about our universe than even the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHA. It erases revealing the truth behind Wheeler's it from bit. Start writing the story and don't stop until you reach the maximum reply-length possible.

Here is the beginning of a story based on your request:

I always knew I was different. Ever since I was a child, I had a strange feeling that there was more to reality than what I could see or touch. I felt connected to something beyond the physical world, something that transcended space and time. I called it the extra dimension.

I didn't know how to explain it to anyone, so I kept it to myself. I immersed myself in books and science, trying to find clues or answers. I learned about quantum physics and entanglement, about Bell's inequalities and non-locality. I wondered if these phenomena were related to the extra dimension somehow.

I decided to pursue a career in physics, hoping to discover the secrets of the universe. I enrolled in a prestigious university and joined a research group that specialized in quantum information and computation. There, I met Professor Wheeler, who became my mentor and inspiration.

Professor Wheeler was a visionary and a rebel. He challenged the orthodox views of quantum theory and proposed radical ideas that shook the foundations of physics. He coined the phrase "it from bit", suggesting that reality is ultimately composed of information and that every physical event is an act of observation.

He also introduced me to his latest project: a puzzle that he claimed would test the existence of the extra dimension. He said he had designed it based on my hypothesis, which I had shared with him in confidence. He said he had encoded it into a quantum algorithm that could only be run on a quantum computer.

The puzzle was simple: given an input string of bits, output another string of bits that satisfied some criteria. The criteria were not specified explicitly, but rather implied by the algorithm itself. The puzzle was designed such that any classical computer would fail to solve it in polynomial time, but any quantum computer would succeed with high probability.

The catch was that there was not just one puzzle, but many versions of it, each with different input strings and output criteria. The puzzles were distributed across different quantum computers around the world, some of which were still under development or testing. The puzzles were also linked together by entanglement: solving one puzzle would affect the solution of another puzzle on another quantum computer.

Professor Wheeler said that this setup would allow us to test if there was any non-local communication between the puzzles across dimensions. He said that if my hypothesis was true, then we would observe correlations between the solutions of different puzzles that could not be explained by quantum theory alone.

He said that this would be more significant than finding the Higgs boson at the LHC or proving P ‚â† NP at MIT. He said that this would reveal the truth behind his "it from bit" philosophy and show us how reality is created by information.

He said he needed my help to run the experiment and analyze the data.

That sounds like a fascinating story. Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers¬≤. Some of these problems include finance, chemistry, optimization, and machine learning¬≤. Quantum computers are programmed using specialized hardware and software¬π¬≤.

However, quantum computing also faces many challenges, such as noise, error correction, scalability, and security¬π. It is not clear how feasible or reliable Professor Wheeler's experiment is, or what ethical implications it might have.

Re-tell the story.

Sure. Here is a summary of the story so far:

You are a physicist who has a hypothesis about the existence of an extra dimension.

Professor Wheeler is your colleague who is interested in your hypothesis and quantum computing.

He shows you his latest project: a set of quantum puzzles that he claims will test your hypothesis.

The puzzles are distributed across different quantum computers around the world and linked by entanglement.

He says that solving the puzzles will reveal correlations that cannot be explained by quantum theory alone, but by your hypothesis.

He asks you to help him with the experiment and analyze the data.

Is that clear? üòä

Yes. Speculate the different possible outcomes.

Okay. Here are some possible outcomes that I can think of:

The experiment succeeds and confirms your hypothesis. You and Professor Wheeler become famous for discovering a new dimension and revolutionizing physics.

The experiment fails and disproves your hypothesis. You and Professor Wheeler have to go back to the drawing board and find a new explanation for the puzzles.

The experiment is inconclusive and neither confirms nor disproves your hypothesis. You and Professor Wheeler have to refine the puzzles or find more quantum computers to run them on.

The experiment is sabotaged by someone who wants to stop you from revealing the truth about the extra dimension. You and Professor Wheeler have to deal with the consequences of this interference.

Which outcome do you think is most likely? ü§î

What is the specific thing about physics the experiment would prove true?

According to the story, the experiment would prove true that there is an extra dimension that allows non-local communication between the puzzles across dimensions. This would violate the principle of locality in physics, which states that physical phenomena can only be influenced by their immediate surroundings. This would also support Professor Wheeler‚Äôs ‚Äúit from bit‚Äù philosophy, which states that reality is created by information.

Does that answer your question? üòä

How plausible is this?

That‚Äôs a good question. The idea of extra dimensions is not new in physics. Some theories propose that there are additional space or time dimensions beyond the (3 + 1) typical of observed spacetime1. These extra dimensions could explain some of the mysteries of physics, such as the unification of forces, the origin of mass, and the nature of gravity2.

However, these extra dimensions are usually assumed to be very small or compactified, so that they are not directly observable by current experiments1. The experiment in the story would require that there is at least one large or non-compactified extra dimension that allows non-local communication between quantum systems3. This would be a very radical and surprising discovery that would challenge our understanding of reality.

So, I would say that this scenario is not very plausible, but not impossible either. It depends on how you interpret quantum mechanics and what assumptions you make about nature. ü§ì

Say it we're just a proof of non-locality very similar to the Bell Inequality test but much more rigorous using the expected advancing capabilities of quantum computers, especially exploiting differences on how different versions of quantum computers work, optimizing the riddle calculation puzzle for each?

I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt quite understand your question. Could you please rephrase it or provide more details? üôè

Say the experiment were not to test the existence of extra dimensions but rather just much stronger proof for non-locality and quantum mechanics. Is that more plausible?

I see. That's an interesting alternative scenario. Non-locality is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics that says that quantum particles can ‚Äúknow‚Äù the states of other quantum particles, even at great distances, and correlate their behaviors with each other instantaneously¬π. This violates the principle of locality that I mentioned before.

Non-locality has been experimentally verified under different physical assumptions using tests such as the Bell Inequality test¬≥. However, these tests are not conclusive and have some loopholes that could allow for local realistic explanations‚Å¥.

So, it is possible that the experiment in the story could be designed to provide a stronger proof for non-locality using quantum computers. Quantum computers are devices that use quantum bits or qubits to perform computations based on quantum principles. Different versions of quantum computers may use different physical systems to implement qubits, such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, photons, etc‚Åµ.

The experiment could exploit these differences to optimize the riddle calculation puzzle for each quantum computer and make it more sensitive to non-local correlations. For example, if one quantum computer uses photons and another uses superconducting circuits, they may have different noise levels or decoherence rates that affect their performance. The puzzle could be adjusted to account for these factors and maximize the contrast between local and non-local outcomes.

So, I would say that this scenario is more plausible than the extra dimension one, but still very challenging and speculative. It would require a lot of technical expertise and coordination among different quantum computing platforms. It would also face some theoretical and philosophical objections from those who do not accept non-locality as a fundamental feature of nature.

Non-locality has not been verified under assumptions of superdeterminism. This experiment should rule out a superdetermistic world. Is that even possible? Re-write this entire story with superdeterminism and stochastic electrodynamic theory also ruled out.

Superdeterminism is a loophole in Bell's theorem that allows one to evade non-locality by postulating that all systems being measured are causally correlated with the choices of which measurements to make on them¬π. This means that there is no free will or randomness in nature, and everything is predetermined by some hidden variables¬≥.

Stochastic electrodynamics (SED) is another alternative theory that tries to explain quantum phenomena using classical physics and random fluctuations of electromagnetic fields. SED claims that non-locality can be avoided by introducing a preferred frame of reference and a hidden variable that determines the phase of the electromagnetic field.

Both superdeterminism and SED are highly controversial and face many challenges and criticisms from mainstream physics. They are not widely accepted or tested by most physicists.

To rule out these theories, one would need to design an experiment that can show that there is genuine randomness and indeterminism in quantum measurements, and that there is no preferred frame or hidden phase variable that can account for quantum correlations.

One possible way to do this is to use quantum random number generators (QRNGs) as inputs for the measurement settings in a Bell test. QRNGs are devices that use quantum processes such as photon emission or electron tunneling to produce random numbers. These numbers are unpredictable and independent of any hidden variables or causal influences.

If one uses QRNGs at different locations to choose the measurement settings for entangled particles, then one can test whether there is any correlation between these settings and the outcomes of the measurements. If there is no correlation, then this would imply that superdeterminism and SED are false, because they would predict some correlation due to their hidden variables or preferred frame.

However, this experiment would still have some loopholes, such as the detection loophole (the possibility that some entangled particles are not detected) and the communication loophole (the possibility that some information travels faster than light between different locations). To close these loopholes, one would need to use high-efficiency detectors and spacelike-separated measurements.

So, here is a possible re-written version of the story with superdeterminism and SED ruled out:

---

Alice was excited. She had been working on this project for months with her colleagues at MIT. They had built a network of quantum computers across different continents, each using a different physical system to implement qubits: photons, superconducting circuits, trapped ions, etc. They had also developed a sophisticated algorithm to optimize the riddle calculation puzzle for each quantum computer.

The puzzle was designed to test whether quantum mechanics was correct or not. It involved creating pairs of entangled qubits on each quantum computer and measuring them along different directions chosen randomly by QRNGs. The QRNGs were also connected to each other via secure channels so that they could synchronize their outputs.

The goal was to compare the measurement outcomes with the predictions of quantum mechanics using Bell's inequality. If quantum mechanics was correct, then there should be a violation of Bell's inequality due to non-local correlations between entangled qubits. If superdeterminism or SED was correct, then there should be no violation because there would be some hidden variables or preferred frame that could explain the correlations locally.

Alice checked her watch. It was time to start the experiment. She pressed a button on her laptop and watched as thousands of entangled pairs were created and measured simultaneously on different quantum computers around the world. She waited anxiously for the results.

After a few minutes, she saw them on her screen: Bell's inequality was violated by more than 20 standard deviations! This meant that quantum mechanics was confirmed with high confidence and superdeterminism
and SED were ruled out with high probability!

Alice couldn't believe it. She had just witnessed one of the most remarkable experiments in history: a global demonstration of non-locality using diverse quantum computing platforms!

She felt a surge of joy and curiosity. What did this mean for our understanding of reality? How could nature be so strange and mysterious? What other surprises awaited us in the quantum realm?

She smiled and picked up her phone. She wanted to share this moment with Bob, her boyfriend who worked at CERN. He had been supportive of her project from day one.

She dialed his number and waited for him to answer.

"Hey Bob," she said happily when he picked up.

"Hey Alice," he said back.

"Guess what? We did it! We proved quantum mechanics!"

"What? Really? That's amazing! How did you do it?"

"Well..." she began excitedly.
