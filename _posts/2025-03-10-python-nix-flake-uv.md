title: Replacing `pip` In Python Nix Flake With `uv`
permalink: /futureproof/python-nix-flake-uv/
description: I decided to ditch the old `pip` and `virtualenv` combo in my Python Nix Flake and embrace `uv`, the new hotness in dependency management, after seeing it pop up in AI projects like MCP and OpenManus. This article walks you through my journey of updating the Nix Flake, showing you how to streamline your Python environments for speed and efficiency, and ultimately getting JupyterLab up and running like a charm. It's all about keeping up with the latest tools and making development smoother, especially when you're diving into cutting-edge AI stuff.

## Modernizing Python Virtual Environments with UV and Nix

This article is me adapting my older technique of creating a Python virtual
environment under Nix using the more traditional `pip` and `virtualenv` programs
to the cool new `uv` program, a re-write in Rust, that's appearing in all the
new AI tools like MCP and Manus. If you're just here to grab the code, you can
get it at my [Python Nix Flake repo on
GitHub](https://github.com/miklevin/python_nix_flake).

### Simplifying Complex Installations

It's really just a starting point for
bottling-up these difficult installs into 2 commands (one to install nix and
another to activate the app. This article documents the conversion.

## Lessons from MCP: When Going Against the Grain Goes Wrong

This weekend was a bust figuring out Anthropic's MCP (model context protocol)
because I went against the grain, 3-fold. I am not using a Mac or Windows
desktop and I insisted on using `pip` instead of `uv`. And finally, I tried
getting rid of the Pedantic MyPy static data typing style. I also considered
making it synchronous, haha!

I did all this to try to distill the MCP example down to as simple a "Hello
World" of MCP as I could, but it was a total bust. The documentation turned out
to be too out of sync with the PyPI and the GitHub distros. I can only imagine
it's working for so many people out there writing MCP servers for AI editors by
following the tutorials very closely.

## Pivoting to OpenManus: The Latest AI Agent Platform

Anyway, I got frustrates and am putting MCP aside for now and taking up the
other big thing ligting up the X-sphere, Manus. Or more precisely, OpenManus. So
what happened?

Another Chinese cloud based app (echos of DeepSeek) put out the next thing just
last Thursday, March 6th, that all the cool AI bros are flocking to right now.
But it is by invitation only. Funny thing is that the open source version of it,
OpenManus, popped up as fast as it was announced.

### Understanding Manus and OpenManus

So what is Manus (and OpenManus)? It looks a bit like OpenAI ChatGPT's
Orchestrator that does browser automation plus coding. It's also like Goose AI,
an open-source AI agent platform released by Block that I tried a few weeks ago.
The idea is that these platforms don't wait for you to prompt them. They take
your initial prompt and create a feedback loop, taking the AI's response and
feeding it back in as a new prompt until the task is complete.

## Embracing UV for Better Dependency Management

Now this is a bandwagon I don't want to miss out on merely because I go against
the grain. Quite the contrary, my "nix" way of operating nixes so much of the
difficulty of doing the installs of these things that the time is right for me
to just get over the hump and put out a super nix flake that does one of these
agentic AI platforms soup-to-nuts.

So, two projects in a row that choose `uv` over pip for dependency control. That
should go hand-in-hand with nix super-well. But I have to test it. So instead of
this article being about the agentic platforms (just yet), it's about me
switching my cross-platform Python Nix Flake that uses `pip` and `virtualenv`
separately into one that uses `nv`.

Here's the before:

```nix
#       ____                      _       _                        .--.      ___________

## Modernizing Our Nix Flake with UV

To make this Flake modern and efficient, I’ve replaced `virtualenv` and `pip` with `uv`, a faster and more integrated Python dependency manager. The changes include:
- Swapping `python313Packages.virtualenv` with `pkgs.uv` in the package list.
- Using `uv venv` instead of `python -m venv` to create the virtual environment in the `shellHook`.
- Replacing `pip install` with `uv pip install` in the `runScript` to handle `requirements.txt` and upgrade `pip` (though `uv` manages this internally, I’ve kept the step for compatibility).

Here’s the updated Nix Flake in its entirety:

```nix
#       ____                      _       _                        .--.      ___________
#      |  _ \  __ _ _ ____      _(_)_ __ (_)_  __    ,--./,-.     |o_o |    |     |     |
#      | | | |/ _` | '__\ \ /\ / / | '_ \| \ \/ /   / #      \    |:_/ |    |     |     |
#      | |_| | (_| | |   \ V  V /| | | | | |>  <   |          |  //   \ \   |_____|_____|

              export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
              export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            else
              echo "No CUDA hardware detected."
            fi

        };

        # Define the development shell for macOS systems
        darwinDevShell = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = commonPackages;
          shellHook = ''
            # Set up the Python virtual environment with uv

        # Choose the appropriate development shell based on the OS
        devShell = if isLinux then linuxDevShell else darwinDevShell;  # Ensure multi-OS support
      });
}
```

For context, here’s the `requirements.txt` this Flake works with:

```python
httpx
jupyter-ai[all]
jupyterlab
nbstripout
numpy
pandas
requests
```

### Why `uv` Works Here
- **Speed**: `uv` is significantly faster than `virtualenv` and `pip`, making environment setup and dependency installation quicker.
- **Integration**: It combines virtual environment creation (`uv venv`) and package management (`uv pip install`) into a single tool, simplifying the Flake.
- **Compatibility**: The `requirements.txt` file you provided (with packages like `numpy`, `pandas`, and `jupyterlab`) is fully supported by `uv`, and the virtual environment it creates is compatible with the existing activation logic (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

### Testing It Out
To use this updated Flake:
1. Save it as `flake.nix` in your project directory alongside `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `nix develop` to enter the development shell.
3. The `run-script` will automatically set up the environment and install the dependencies.
4. Type `start` to launch JupyterLab, and `stop` to shut it down.

This Flake now leverages `uv` for a modern, efficient setup, aligning with the
trends I've noticed in projects like MCP and OpenManus. Next step? Maybe
tackling that agentic AI platform with this as a base—stay tuned!

## Testing `nv` Under Nix

Alright, so I simply copy over the `requirements.txt` from another similar
project where I pioneered my multi-OS portable python nix flake and drop the new
`flake.nix` file that uses `uv` (courtesy of Grok 3, I should credit) into the
new repo, and `nix develop` from there and `start` JupyterLab...

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/python_nix_flake]$ cp ../darwinix/requirements.txt .

[mike@nixos:~/repos/python_nix_flake]$ vim flake.nix
