description: I'm excited to be working in tech again after the early 90s, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to work for Moz. I'm helping people with their existential crisis in this tech-filled world by using Jupyter Notebooks to copy/paste code from AIs and debug. I'm also showing people how to run a Linux VM cheaply, cleanly, and locally. Join me on this journey of tech exploration and discover how to use the latest tools and techniques.

Okay, so it's kind of like an opportunity of a lifetime working for Moz. But of
course, I felt that way about Commodore, back in 1991 and such when I was
beamed up to the mothership, the makers of the beloved Amiga computer! Not
since the early 90s have I really loved tech like the way I finally do again
today, thanks mostly to Linux, Python, vim & git, and with a sprinkling of
Jupyter and the general web stack. And today, we have AI. I mean isn't this
really interesting, thrilling and exciting these times we live in.

Let me help walk a certain portion of you through whatever existential crisis
these times may induce. Imposter syndrome, and variations thereof... have you
felt it? Do you feel it often? How do you feel now knowing that a machine's
going to be better at you at almost whatever you do in some number of years? Ha
yeah, the youngun's just being born now won't know any other world, but we have
the privilege of being here with front row seats... wow! And it's landing right
in the middle of my chosen field here, SEO, after some 20 years of not much.

Things change, and this will be one of them. I've been through a few, and maybe
nothing this big, but I am going to be able to talk about re-platforming.
You're not going away. But the tools and the nature of the job are going to
change. A whole lot of optimizing's going on. But what to do today? Let's talk
powerful safe-havens. Let's talk not-so-bad Plan B's. Get good at something
that, while it may look at first too far outside your comfort-zone, the value
of which is revealed by the very announcement of GPT-4 two days ago.

If there's one take-away from the GPT-4 announcement, it's that you're going to
be using Jupyter Notebooks. And you're going to be copy/pasting code from AIs
into Notebooks, and then of course use those AIs to help you debug the code.

Or are you?

Follow me right here, right now, today and I'm going to show you the one true
best way to run JuptyerLab so that everything else about your future-proofing
starts falling into place little by little. Before long, you'll have
full-featured alternative ways of working with computers, from learning with an
AI to implementing on genuine generic headless timeless Linux.

Why? Because that's where and how everything runs if you don't want scaling or
licensing problems. Linux builds everything from supercomputers to smart
trashcans. If it's got a general purpose computer built-in, it's running Linux,
or some variation thereof. If you learn on Linux where the action's at, you'll
be perfectly comfortable if you end up on Unix in one of those edge cases.
Where your code has no future is if it's running on expensive or proprietary
systems, and that often means cloud services from cloud providers.

I show you how to run a Linux VM, cheaply, cleanly and locally. It'll be the
magic window behind JuptyerLab running for all intents and purposes in your
native OS's browser, be it Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox or whatever. It's
browser agnostic, so long as it's standard and modern.

Linux, Python, vim & git... and honorary Jupyter, because JupyterLab back-ended
by genuine Linux running a lot like a server would is your secret weapon. We'll
do stuff there with that server besides hosting Jupyter. We'll do a bunch of
cool SEO stuff there, and we'll avoid full-web-stack-itis.

- It's going to be easy.
- It's going to be fun.
- It's going to be be fruitful.

Gotta make a personal video that I can point to and say: "See, like this. But
for Moz." It's my practice-runs, such as it were, and the result is a polished
Pipulate that I can use for all the other responsibilities I'll have.
