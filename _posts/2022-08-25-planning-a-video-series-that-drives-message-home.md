title: Planning a Video Series That Drives Message Home
headline: Explore the Journey of Moving Away from Microsoft and Apple Systems with Me!
description: This video series will be a tutorial on how to move away from Microsoft and Apple systems and will explore topics such as Windows 10, WSL2, LXD Containers, and programming projects. I'll also discuss the evolution of an idea, the pursuit of craft, the 80/20-rule, and how to do what you love for money. Join me on this journey to reach a wider audience and learn how to make the switch from Microsoft and Apple systems.

I've done a 3 videos in a row using Google Sheets. Feedback has been good. I
can distil my message down very effectively in that format, and I'm sure reach
a broader audience than with my long rambling format. I still like not editing
video. Even this format, I generally do in one take. Life's too short to edit
video, unless you're sincerely trying to make a living off it. I'm not. I'm in
it for higher levels on the Maslow pyramid of needs, like community and stuff.

The long unedited and unscripted videos still let me just do my work and make
videos out of it. But with a little planning, vision and revision, I can reach
more people more effectively. Next step is to try getting the best of both
worlds, and to push myself forward with a series people can follow. They'll
open up with a script laying out what I'm trying to do and why. Then it'll do
it. It'll be a good tutorial series for the most important thing in tech,
plotting your way off of both Microsoft and Apple systems.

I'll use YouTube playlists and pages on MikeLev.in to compel people into the
correct linear sequence. Yes, think in terms of linear sequences of videos!
Think in terms of how to keep people on those linear sequences. Drive up
view-times per video and subsequent follow-up views of related videos. Lock 'em
in a chute. Microsoft does it at a massive profiteering level. Why can't I for
some social good? Make a page on the site that lays this all out, both to help
me to keep on track and for those in my audience who might be interested.

It will mostly be about settling into Windows 10 (again) and giving it a Linux
CLI and getting on vim for daily use with virtual desktops. It'll start with
that PC where I reset it to Windows 10 factory default. Then I'll move along to
a full WSL2 install with fullscreen Terminal (again). We generally have vim
loaded on that full-screen for a daily journal. And yes, that's the main
message. I think it seems to be emerging as the main thing, but I'll have
"aside" videos where I:
