title: Starting to Ideate the Idea Capture Device
headline: Exploring Creative Ways to Capture Ideas and Experience the World
description: I'm trying to come up with a creative way to capture all of my ideas, so I recently looked into using Python to read emails and create an idea capture machine. This got me thinking of the song John Henry, and how he worked so hard that he broke his poor heart. I'm now on a mission to find a way to capture my ideas and explore the world.

It's all about process and churn. You don't have to preserve every bit of data,
but you can kinda sorta try by keeping a reverse chronological blog format,
i.e. a journal, as one of your various text files in your life. Capture
everything there but don't publish. Don't know where to throw a thought that
just occurred to you? Throw it in your private unpublished journal. You can
always search it later with various means. But the thought is captured.

Journal not at hand? No problem. Email it to yourself. No phone or computer
onhand? NP, jot it on your hand with a pen. No pen? Use the method of loci to
associate that idea with an image of a place in your head that you know you're
going to think about again. In the first place, in the second place, and so on.
Think through your places every once in awhile and see if you can recover the
ideas to which you created synaptic neural links. In such a way you have
several lines of defense to capture ideas.

Don't ***not*** move forward in life over purity issues. If only this... if
only that... artificial dependency #1 inserted due to fear, uncertainty and
doubt. Artificial dependency #2 inserted for similar but different reasons.
Lather, rinse, repeat, continue living in the town of your birth never knowing
your favorite places and foods and joys and experiences on Earth. You've been
given a friggn slot here on this material plain to do things of which the
Angels can but dream. Take advantage of it. It's not that everyone needs to be
a bestlife travelista, but rather to try things. They can be local. You can
stay in your local town, but at least travel far and wide vicariously in your
mind by reading and otherwise interacting with the world and others.

Nobody's told it to you enough yet in your tech career or in life, uniqueness
is a thing. Precisely what sort of thing it is and of how much value is
difficult to say, but much energy goes into determining the uniqueness of a
thing.

Hmmm. I recently just looked at reading emails with Python. Idea capture
machine. Jot it down, send it off, publish it here, lather, rinse, repeat. Such
a system shouldn't really litter up this published journal, but it could easily
become a different page on the site. Or maybe just a single page of this blog,
like maybe the very first post, always. Haha, wow, That's unique. And no WebDev
per se involved.

Oh, capture John Henry:

    John Henry was a little baby, sitting on the his papa's knee
    He picked up a hammer and little piece of steel
    Said "Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord
    Hammer's gonna be the death of me"

    The captain said to John Henry
    "Gonna bring that steam drill 'round
    Gonna bring that sterm drill out on the job
    Gonna whop that steel on down, Lord, Lord
    Gonna whop that steel on down"

    John Henry told his captain
    "A man ain't nothing but a man
    But before I let your steam drill beat me down
    I'd die with a hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord
    I'd die with a hammer in my hand"

    John Henry said to his shaker
    "Shaker, why don't you sing?
    I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on down
    Just listen to that cold steel ring, Lord, Lord
    Just listen to that cold steel ring"

    John Henry said to his shaker
    "Shaker, you'd better pray
    'Cause if I miss that little piece of steel
    Tomorrow be your buryin' day, Lord, Lord
    Tomorrow be your buryin' day"

    The shaker said to John Henry
    "I think this mountain's cavin' in!"
    John Henry said to his shaker, "Man
    That ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind!  Lord, Lord
    That ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind!"

    Now the man that invented the steam drill
    Thought he was mighty fine
    But John Henry made fifteen feet
    The steam drill only made nine, Lord, Lord
    The steam drill only made nine

    John Henry hammered in the mountains
    His hammer was striking fire
    But he worked so hard, he broke his poor heart
    He laid down his hammer and he died, Lord, Lord
    He laid down his hammer and he died

    John Henry had a little woman
    Her name was Polly Ann
    John Henry took sick and went to his bed
    Polly Ann drove steel like a man, Lord, Lord
    Polly Ann drove steel like a man

    John Henry had a little baby
    You could hold him in the palm of your hand
    The last words I heard that poor boy say
    "My daddy was a steel driving man, Lord, Lord
    My daddy was a steel driving man"

    They took John Henry to the graveyard
    And they buried him in the sand
    And every locomotive comes a-roaring by
    Says "There lies a steel-driving man, Lord, Lord
    There lies a steel-driving man"

    Well every Monday morning
    When the bluebirds begin to sing
    You can hear John Henry a mile or more
    You can hear John Henry's hammer ring, Lord, Lord
    You can hear John Henry's hammer ring
