I'm spending more time on cultivating a positivity bias. I've had difficulty in
recent years... recent being like the past 15 years which is terribly

old. The greatest favor I can do for them in life is to cultivate my own
positivity, and by extension the successes I have rarely achieved in life. They
have to see me start to achieve my visions and dreams despite the waves and
oceans of negativity that wash over me (and us) on a daily basis. This video
