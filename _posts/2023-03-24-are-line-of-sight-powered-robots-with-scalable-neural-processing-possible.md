title: Are Line of Sight Powered Robots With Scalable Neural Processing Possible?
headline: Exploring the Depths of the Ocean with Line of Sight Powered Robots and Drones
description: I recently asked Bing about the influential submarine designer Graham Hawkes, who is known for designing 70% of the crewed submersibles produced in the 1980s and 1990s. I then asked about his use of upside down lift designs and whether robots or drones can be equipped to send and receive power by line-of-sight transmission. Bing provided me with some answers, and I'm now exploring the depths of the ocean to find new species of fish and other sea creatures. Join me on my journey.

**Mike Levin:** Who is the influential submarine designer who uses upside down lift designs? I think his name is Graham Lawlor or something like that.

**Bing:** The marine engineer and submarine designer you are referring to is Graham Hawkes¹. He is known for designing 70% of the crewed submersibles produced in the 1980s and 1990s¹. He also built the Deep Flight Challenger Submersible³. However, I could not find any information about him using upside down lift designs. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Mike Levin:** What is the name of the trench his designs were intended to explore?

**Bing:** I'm not sure which trench you are referring to. I could not find any information about the trench his designs were intended to explore. However, he built the Deep Flight Challenger Submersible which was designed to explore the depths of the ocean. Is there anything else I can help you with?

What is the deepest trench or ravine in the ocean?

The deepest trench or ravine in the ocean is the Mariana Trench¹. The deepest part of the Mariana Trench is known as the Challenger Deep and is 10,911 meters (35,797 feet) below sea level¹. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Mike Levin:** What are the greatest known unexplored areas of the Earth like the Mariana Trench and depths of the Amazon jungle?

**Bing:** There are many unexplored areas on Earth. Some of the most unexplored places include the Southern Namib Desert, Surtsey Island off of Iceland, Son Doong Cave in Vietnam's Nha-Ke Bang National Park, and several mountains in Himalayan country Bhutan¹. The ocean is the last unexplored resource on Earth, so it's not surprising that there are swaths of it that have remained unseen. The Mariana Trench is one of those places, located in the western part of the Pacific Ocean⁴. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Mike Levin:** What impact will robots and drones have on the exploration such locations?

**Bing:** Robots and drones are already playing a key role in exploration. They are enabling mankind to go farther out in space, dive deeper down into the ocean, and even uncover new facts in places where researchers have looked many times before¹. For example, NASA has sent drones and robots into volcanic tunnels and Martian craters¹. Robots will allow us to explore places 100 or 200 or 500 years before we would ever be able to do it in the flesh¹. Drones have the potential to provide non-invasive and eco-friendly platforms from which the environmental impact of exploration and mining activities can be assessed³.

**Mike Levin:** Is there a line of sight way to transmit power?

**Bing:** Yes, there is a line-of-sight transmission method to transmit power. Line-of-sight transmission means the transmitting and receiving antennae can "see" each other as shown. The maximum distance at which they can see each other, dLOS, occurs when the sighting line just grazes the earth's surface. At the usual radio frequencies, propagating electromagnetic energy does not follow the earth's surface¹.

**Mike Levin:** Can drones or robots be equipped to send and receive power by line of sight transmission?

**Bing:** Yes, drones and robots can be equipped to send and receive power by line-of-sight transmission. For example, a power line-crawling robot called LineRanger can inspect several kilometers of power lines on one charge of its battery pack¹. Drones themselves come equipped with sensors that detect power lines so they do not come into contact with them³. However, I could not find any information on whether drones or robots can send and receive power by line-of-sight transmission.

**Bing:** I'm sorry, but I could not find any information on the longest line of sight line of robots that could keep itself powered from one power source at one end. However, the potential LoRaWAN operating range in a Line-of-Sight application has been shown in a real Line of Sight Long Range test of LoRa¹.

**Mike Levin:** Speculate. Make it part of a story of a series of attempts to find the answer with each attempt getting longer. approach the limit.

**Bing:** Once upon a time, there was a group of scientists who were trying to find the answer to the question of the longest line of sight line of robots that could keep itself powered from one power source at one end. They tried many different approaches, but each attempt got longer and longer, approaching the limit. They tried to use LoRaWAN, but it didn't work. They tried to use different types of robots and power sources, but it still didn't work. They even tried to use different types of power transmission and storage, but it still didn't work. Finally, they decided to give up and focus on other research.

Use this story as the starting point for the next story where AI neural hardware added to the line of sight chain of robot's collective computing power. Each robot added ads to thinking power to figure out how far the chain could go. Take such a scenario to its ultimate conclusion.

The scientists decided to give up on their research, but one day, a new group of scientists came along and decided to take on the challenge. They added AI neural hardware to the line of sight chain of robot's collective computing power. Each robot added ads to thinking power to figure out how far the chain could go. They took such a scenario to its ultimate conclusion and found that the chain could go on for miles and miles. They were amazed at what they had discovered and decided to share their findings with the world.

**Mike Levin:** Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Bing:** List the top applications for such a chain of of line of sight powered neural node robots or drones.

The line of sight powered neural node robots or drones can be used in various applications such as exploration of fire or earthquake-damaged buildings, or surveys of land¹. They can also be used for drone-to-drone communications, which may be used to enable drone swarms, in which multiple UAVs can work together to accomplish tasks more effectively². Another application is the development of a machine vision system for UAVs and more³. AI drones can also be used for construction inspection, 3D modeling and security patrol⁴.

**Mike Levin:** Be more creative. Speculate on things including deep ocean or space exploration. Explore the linking of two or more miles long chains. Intersperse new power sources on the chain.

**Bing:** The line of sight powered neural node robots or drones can be used in various applications such as deep ocean or space exploration. The linking of two or more miles long chains can be used to explore the depths of the ocean or the vastness of space. Interspersing new power sources on the chain can help to extend the range of the robots or drones and allow them to explore even further.

**Mike Levin:** Now tell a story where this was done.

**Bing:** Once upon a time, there was a group of scientists who wanted to explore the depths of the ocean. They decided to use line of sight powered neural node robots or drones to explore the ocean floor. They linked two or more miles long chains together and interspersed new power sources on the chain to extend the range of the robots or drones. They were able to explore the depths of the ocean and discover new species of fish and other sea creatures.
