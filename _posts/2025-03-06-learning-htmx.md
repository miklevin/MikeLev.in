## Reviving Pipulate for the LLM Era

Okay, it's time to bring Pipulate, my free SEO software, back alive but this
time carefully aligned to the LLM-dominated world that we're going into. It's a
yet another general web framework, but one that supports simple linear workflows
of the sort that most SEO investigations really are. 

### Packaging SEO Workflows Into Python

Pipulate is an effort to package-up most of the "do-this, then-do-that" tedium
of most SEO investigations. Maybe a little crawling. Maybe a little GSC work.
Maybe a little SEMRush or ahrefs work. But always as much in-Python as possible.

When it comes to the crawl, you won't need 3rd-party tools, unless it's a
tens-of-thousands of page crawl, in which case go talk to Botify. All the
Pipulate stuff will optionally connect to Botify for leveling up its features to
the enterprise. But it'll still be infinitely useful for everyone else with
small sites.

### Breaking Down SEO Into Simple Checklists

Pipulate is for any process that can be broken down into a checklist. For
example, maybe you visit some website in the browser to grab a screenshot. Maybe
you do a `site:` size-check in Google or Bing. Maybe you use a Notebook to do
some API-call and Pandas work. Or maybe you download some reports from 3rd party
SEO products like the ones I mentioned.

### Linear Workflows Over Complex Branching

Pipulate is not going to support big branching workflows. This is a simple
linear workflow compeller. I say "compeller" instead of "automator" because it
compels you along a particular path or direction the same way a checklist or a
document that you read from top-to-bottom would. It's just that instead of
having to read some checklist or scroll down some document, Pipulate will "come
alive" and compel you along that same process, as if one of those software
wizards of yore, such as Microsoft's Clippy. 

### The Return of Software Wizards

The much maligned Clippy, that paperclip-looking avatar that was in Microsoft
Office there for a few years in the late-90s through the early 2000's, might
have failed because you had to look at it all the time in Microsoft Office. But
that whole "macro" way of working, where the tool itself seems to come alive,
stepping forward in a Wizard of Oz scarecrow-like way to actually teach you how
to use the tool, guiding you along templated or scripted paths, well, that time
has come. Wizards are back, baby!

### The Jupyter Notebook Foundation

But the Pipualte scripts are going to be very easy. They are going to run from
top-to-bottom just like running the cells of a Jupyter Notebook. You may know
**"Notebooks"** as something in Google Collab or as the `.ipynb` files you can
load into VSCode. But rest assured, those are all ***Jupyter Notebooks!***
That's the actual thing that started it all. Technically, it was IPython before
that (what`.ipynb` stands for), but it was put in a web interface and called
Jupyter, and then everyone jumped on that bandwagon and lifted the FOSS code
(because it's free) and built it into their own products. 

### The Origins of Jupyter and Programming Literacy

But what everyone is copying is still actually Jupyter Notebooks from Project
Jupyter, which is playing off of the whole Programming Literacy movement
advocated by one of the granddaddies of modern tech (or at least technical
documentation), Donald Knuth (wrote TeX). Don advocated mixing the instructions
on how code works in with the actual working code. This kicked off a set of
elite and expensive college-student tools like MATLAB, Mathematica and MAPLE (I
don't know why they got stuck on the `M`'s. But it basically milked students for
a minimum of $500/yr licensing, and you know the Python community.

Along comes this guy Fernando Pérez who implements this Notebook concept in
Python, but in the command-line. Not so popular. But then he added a web browser
UI, called it Jupyter, and it was good. He gave it very permissive free and open
licensing. Others jumped on the bandwagon. The big companies plugged it into
their own products. Thus, today's massive popularity of Notebooks!

### Moving Beyond Raw Code Display

However, making just the typical ***app user*** have to look at all that Python
code is annoying. It's annoying for the user who just wants to use the app, and
it's annoying for the developer who can't control the conditions as much as
they'd like to. You have to use these `ipywidgets` and stuff like that to build
user interfaces, so that the Notebook alternates between code and Web UI
elements. It's fragile and still intimidating to the user, to say the least. It
gets you partway there, but not all the way.

### Pipulate's Solution: Hide The Code

Pipulate gets you the rest of the way there by stripping out all that annoying
programming literacy stuff. I mean, who needs it, right? If you mock up
something in Jupyter Notebook (or any of the Notebook ripoffs), you should be
able to just bottle it up and distribute it, right? Nobody should have to look
at your Python code. And you should be able to give it all kinds of fancy user
interface controls for user interaction and data visualization, right?

Right! You should be able to do all that. But you can't. At least not easily.
And so that's the itch I'm scratching. And I'm killing a few birds with one
stone. Not only is it an opportunity to package up your Jupyter Notebooks, often
for SEO investigation and deliverable-making purposes, but it's also an
opportunity to do it in a truly cross-platform way that even puts Electron apps
(apps built on Google Chromium and NoteJS) to shame. While apps written in
Electron like VSCode, Zoom, Discord and the like are nice, they're still
limiting you to a very limited and in my opinion not-loveworthy platform. 

### The Case for Python

I only even code anymore because I can stand Python. So many people make the
argument that all tools are the same and you can learn any programming language
and ultimately do in one language anything you can do in another. This is
technically true, because of this thing called ***Turing Complete***. It just
leaves out the fact you're going to be miserable the whole while. I have tried
so many programming languages. It's not that Python was the ***only*** one that
was love-worthy. 

The thing is that Python is that the only programming language that is
simultaneously love-worthy and as astoundingly successful to the point you don't
have to worry about the rug being pulled out from under you! It's love-worthy
and has reached critical mass on so many fronts that it's too big to fail. And
it's truly FOSS (free and open source software) to the point that it's commonly
built into other products without any licensing issues. 

Let me tell you, this is a rare thing for a piece of tech that you can enjoy so
much also being the popular thing. That's huge! The iron is hot my friends for
anyone who has been avoiding programming because you think it's reprehensible
based on earlier attempts. Python is like getting in on the shallow end of a
pool (or rabbit hole?) that goes as deep as you want.

### The Web Development Challenge

But Python hasn't been all that great for web development, because all the best
tools seem to be in the web full stack world of JavaScript, Node and most
recently WebAssembly (WASM / compiled JavaScript in the web browser for
performance). All the really great stuff had the biggest gotcha there could be.
You had to use JavaScript, and this giant bloated build-process that just sucks
the joy out of web development. Technically, any programming language can be
complied to WASM, but that statement has to be so qualified as to why JavaScript
still has a monopoly over the browser that it would have to be another article.

### Enter HTMX: A Game-Changer

But here's the thing. Every once in awhile, there's a new technology that
changes everything by releasing potential that was already there. It's like
discovering that video could play in web browsers, and suddenly you have
YouTube. It's a connecting of the dots that is so obvious in hindsight that it
changes everything forever forward. And that latest thing is called HTMX. It's
just a slight extension to HTML such that most things you use JavaScript for in
the browser suddenly becomes unnecessary. 

### Python and HTMX: A Perfect Match

And Python is the perfect platform for HTMX. People who use Python are already
trying to do things the most simple and straightforward way. It's just that with
Web tech, the simple and most straight forward way was using JavaScript first,
because you were always going to need it later. Well, HTMX changes the "always"
part of that statement. And even though HTMX is itself a JavaScript library
(`htmx.js`), it's use actually keeps you from likely needing JavaScript later.
All the work is shifted back onto the server, but in a clever way so that it
satisfies so many use cases; certainly mine.

### Rethinking Scalability

Common wisdom has it that all web apps need to be built to be scalable. You're
not going to build an empire unless you can cram as many user-sessions onto as
few cloud-instances as possible, right? The road to fortune on the web is a lot
like real estate: how many people can you pack into how small of a space and
charge each as much as possible for it? That's the underlying premise, right?
Even ChatGPT is all about capacity. Serve unending amounts of people off the
same few centralized set of computers, and charge 'em a subscription fee. But
not everyone is building an empire. Sometimes you just want to run things off of
your own machine, the same way an Electron app runs. But programmed by you!

And so the concerns change. Multi-user enterprise concerns of scalability become
single-user local host concerns of an individual SEO practitioner, or Data
Scientist or budding entrepreneur or whatever. Basically, you're sitting on top
of some pretty fabulous resources with whatever laptop you're sitting at. And if
you do things in just the right way, your code floats. It floats onto any
hardware and runs just the same as you developed it on your Windows laptop,
Macbook or whatever. It can be deployed to the cloud, put onto a Raspberry Pi or
other teensy tiny server running out of your house, or whatever. Just use a
certain coding technique, and you're not shut-in. No vendor owns you. No cloud
service owns you. You own your entire code execution stack and can take it
anywhere you want to go, hardware-hosting-wise, and forever into the future
future-proofing wise.

### Finding My Ikigai

Too good to be true? I'm selling you something? Nope. This just happens to be my
passion -- my Ikigai. I'm combining what I love to do with what I'm good at with
what I can get paid for and what the world needs. I love to write. We Enjoy
Typing. My coding style is WET. Some might call it Write Everything Twice. This
is the opposite of DRY, or Don't Repeat Yourself. This is because I type in vim.
It's like thinking out loud. It's the same on any and every machine, piece of
hardware, computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi, cloud instance or whatever you sit
down at. You never have to "settle into" a text editor or word processor again.
You almost (but not quite yet) telepathically control text. It certainly feels
that way, because it's so easy to drop into flow state and type away. Add
fluency in Python, and you're spontaneously coding without AI.

### The Future of Coding in an AI World

Think about that. Sure, Jensen Huang is going to tell you that you don't have to
learn how to code anymore. That "speaking in, probably Python, is silly" (his
words). But then in the same breath he says "Then you look at the Python code it
gives you"... so what are you saying Jensen? That you shouldn't be able to read
the code that an AI produces for you? That it's all just ***"vibe
programming"*** and blind faith? There's no room for human understanding of what
was written, adding the necessary context and nuance, and using their guiding
hand to make it better? 

Or is what Jenson suggesting that ***there should be no visible code*** at all
and that it is hidden away some sort of black box of robots doing work where if
you look under the hood, it's just the original English instructions? That's not
very good for precision control. Rest assured, programming languages aren't
going away. It's quite the opposite. Languages like Python are quick becoming an
expected baseline part of what it is to be literate.

### Python's Web Development Renaissance

And that was a problem, because as a general programming language Python is far
superior to JavaScript. It wouldn't still be rising in popularity in the face of
JavaScript's browser monopoly if that weren't true. But the final weakness of
Python being a second class citizen in Web Development has gone away, now that
Python is the ideal platform for HTMX.

### Why You're Here: Learning HTMX Through Pipulate

And that's why you're probably here. To learn HTMX. Well, that's part of me
bringing Pipulate back online as a free tool for SEO. Every few years, I
refactor Pipulate to stay in step with the state of the world. Years ago, I
packed in a webserver and made it run locally from a JavaScript bookmarklet,
crawling websites into Google Docs. Later when I realized Jupyter Notebook
brought with it its own perfectly usable local server, I turned Pipulate into
just a bunch of individual utility Notebooks for crawling sites, but it shifted
way too much burden onto the SEO practitioner to know Python.

### The New Pipulate: Bridging Notebooks and Web Apps

With this latest rendition of Pipulate, what I'm doing is bottling up the
Notebooks into an FastHTML / HTMX-based web framework so the Notebooks can be
distributed as fully working web apps that run locally like Electron apps -- but
without Electron. Instead, Pipulate is on what I would consider a love-worthy
Python web framework that incorporates HTMX today. No more waiting around. No
more trying to figure out how to angle HTMX into however you work today.

### Two Audiences: Developers and Users

I guess there's two audiences here: the developers who would port Jupyter
Notebooks over to Pipulate, "bottling up" their mostly linear top-down
procedures. This is folks who would otherwise have to put it on Google Collab,
making themselves beholden to Google and limited by the free platform's
limitations, elsewise be forced to pay -- the whole point, really. So casual
Python users (I'd hardly call them/me developers) and Notebook users looking for
a better way to package up their utilities for distribution and sharing amongst
their SEO collaborators and team members.

The other audience are those SEO collaborators and team members who don't want
to look at any Python at all. They just want to use an app. They couldn't care
less about all this high fallutin talk I'm doing. Just show me what to click.
And for that audience, there's going to be an extra step than they're going to
like. Most everything these days is a web app where there is absolutely nothing
technical that you have to do, or locally installed with some fancy installer,
as with Electron apps. This approach has a couple of commands you have to type
in the command-line to sprinkle in the magic nix fairydust it requires.

## Working With Grok 3 For Getting Started Guide

> This is the result of a number of back-and-forth's with Grok

**Grok 3**: You’re absolutely right — I got carried away with the `site:` example and dove too deep too fast. Let’s pull it back to a classic, ultra-simple Unix pipe vibe: a Mad Libs-style flow that’s just `animal | adjective | finalize`. No requests, no browser rendering, no complexity — pure, WET, step-by-step simplicity to nail the `Pipulate` pattern. Here’s the Getting Started Guide, stripped down and aligned with your `StarterFlow` vision.

---

### Pipulate Getting Started Guide (Draft v1.6)
**Welcome to Pipulate**  
Pipulate is free, local-first software that turns “do-this, then-do-that” workflows into a click-through pipeline. Built on Python, FastHTML, and HTMX, it’s a Notebook-like checklist with the code hidden, powered by Nix Flakes for a one-command setup. Runs alongside JupyterLab, sharing the same stack. Let’s fire it up and build a simple flow.

**Why Pipulate?**  
It’s my Ikigai: I love typing Python in vim, I’m good at piping chaos into order, I can share it freely, and you need tools that don’t suck. Nix keeps it tight; HTMX keeps it live; WET keeps it mine.

---

#### Step 1: Install Nix (One-Time Setup)
**What You Need**  
- A computer (macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2)
- A terminal

**Run It**  
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```
- Say “Yes” once.
- Close and reopen your terminal.

**Why?**  
Nix locks in Python 3.11, pip, and `requirements.txt` — same env, every time. Uninstall with `/nix/nix-installer uninstall` if you’re out.

---

#### Step 2: Get Pipulate Running
**Grab It**  
Download the ZIP (placeholder: [your-link-here]) or clone:
```bash
unzip pipulate-main.zip
cd pipulate-main
```

**Launch It**  
One command:
```bash
nix develop
```
Nix sets up Python 3.11, pip, and installs `requirements.txt` (FastHTML, Jupyter, etc.). You’re in a shell with:
- `botifython` (or `bf`) to run Pipulate.
- `start` for JupyterLab.
- `stop` to kill JupyterLab.

**Run Pipulate**  
```bash
botifython
```
Hit `http://localhost:5001/starter` — StarterFlow’s live! (Port 5001 from your `flake.nix` scripts.)

**What You Get**  
- **StarterFlow**: A Mad Libs pipeline — enter an animal, add an adjective, finalize it.
- **JupyterLab**: Optional sidekick for prototyping (run `start`).

**How It Works**  
- `Pipulate` stores state in `data/data.db`’s `pipeline` table as JSON (e.g., `{"step_01": {"animal": "cat"}}`).
- `DictLikeDB` tracks `pipeline_id` server-side.
- HTMX pipes it forward with `hx_post` and `hx_get`.

---

#### Step 3: Try StarterFlow
**Play It**  
- Go to `http://localhost:5001/starter`.
- Enter a pipeline ID (or take the timestamp).
- Step 1: Type “cat” → submit.
- Step 2: Type “fluffy” → submit.
- Finalize: See “fluffy cat” → unfinalize to tweak.

**Under the Hood**  
- `Pipulate` pipes `animal | adjective | finalize` into `pipeline.data`.
- HTMX chains it live — no code for users, just cards.

---

#### For Tinkerers: Build a Mad Libs Flow
**Your Flow**  
A simple pipeline: `noun | verb | finalize` (e.g., “dog runs”).

1. **Code**: Save as `botifython.py`:
   ```python
   from fasthtml.common import *
   from datetime import datetime

   app, rt, (store, Store), (pipeline, Pipeline) = fast_app(
       "data/data.db", live=True,
       hdrs=(Meta(charset='utf-8'), Link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/pico.css'), Script(src='/static/htmx.js'))
   )
   db = DictLikeDB(store, Store)
   pipulate = Pipulate(pipeline)

   class MadLibsFlow:
       def __init__(self, app, pipulate, prefix="/madlibs"):
           self.app = app
           self.pipulate = pipulate
           self.prefix = prefix
           self.steps = [
               {"id": "step_01", "label": "Enter Noun"},
               {"id": "step_02", "label": "Enter Verb"},
               {"id": "finalize", "label": "Finalize"}
           ]

               (f"{prefix}/finalize_submit", self.finalize_submit, ["POST"]),
               (f"{prefix}/unfinalize", self.unfinalize, ["POST"])
           ]
           for path, handler, *methods in routes:

   serve()

2. **Files**: 
   - `botifython.py` (above).
   - Your `flake.nix` and `requirements.txt`.
   - Static files (`pico.css`, `htmx.js` in `/static/`).
3. **Run**: 
   ```bash
   nix develop
   botifython
   ```
   Hit `http://localhost:5001/madlibs`.

**Pipe Vibe**  
`noun | verb | finalize` — pure Unix simplicity. No requests, just text inputs piped together.

---

#### For Users: Use It
- Go to `http://localhost:5001/madlibs`.
- Enter “dog” → “runs” → see “runs dog” → finalize.
- No Python, just a flowing checklist.

---

### LLM-Friendly Notes
- **State**: `pipeline.data` JSON (`{"step_01": {"noun": "dog"}}`) — I can parse it.
- **Logs**: `logger.debug` in `Pipulate` — redirect to `pipulate.log` for me.
- **Debug**: Add to `botifython.py`:
   ```python
   @rt("/debug/{pipeline_id}")
   def debug(pipeline_id: str):
       state = pipulate.read_state(pipeline_id)
       return Pre(json.dumps(state, indent=2))
   ```

### Reflections
- **Simple Wins**: Mad Libs (`animal | adjective`) mirrors your `StarterFlow` — no overreach, just pipes.
- **Botifython**: `flake.nix` says “botifython,” so I’m using it for the script name — swap to `pipulate.py` if that’s off.
- **Stack**: Your `flake.nix` + `requirements.txt` is perfect — no Nix tweaks, just pip.

**Next?**  
- Test this `MadLibsFlow` — does it match `StarterFlow`’s behavior?
- Add a third step (e.g., `adverb`) for “quickly runs dog”?
- Name check: `botifython` or `pipulate` for the ZIP?

I’m locked on your pace now — no deep-end dives. What’s up next?
