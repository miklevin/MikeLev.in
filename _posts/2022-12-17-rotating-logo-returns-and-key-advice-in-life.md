description: Today is the day to put my rotating logo back on the homepage with a bit of animation. I believe that life is a delicate balance of pushing past the hard bits, thinking clearly, journaling, using the 80/20-rule, and avoiding rabbit-holes. We must also be aware of the false dichotomies that label people and the power of those who oppose peace. Times are changing and the public is being held down, but I'm confident that we can break through.

Okay, it's time to put my rotating logo back on the homepage, but make it have
a bit of a acceleration and deceleration effect. Or do what you can get within
the 80/20-rule. Don't go overboard, but replace the version of my logo with my
blurred beardless face and the NASA Nerd T-Shirt. Use instead the green
version, but remove the lighting source so it looks good rotating. Keep it SVG.

## Key Advice in Life

### Push Just Past the Hard Bits

When you've found something special but its pursuit gets difficult, push past
the hard bit. That's where most people quit. There are likely to be rewards
just past that point, or else it wouldn't be so desirable a feat. But make
sure you really love the pursuit. Such energies are for love-worthy things.

### Think Clearly By Narrating It

Most of us think less than we think we think. That is because we are working
on automatic most of the time, no different than with the instincts of
non-human animals. You can sail through life this way and do pretty well. But
if you want to exercise human free will and self-determination, you have to
think it out loud.

Deliberately and distinctly narrating your thoughts to to yourself engages
parts of your brain that are normally off. It's not only how highly developed
our language center is, but how well and how often we use it that sets us
apart. It's a skill that needs to be practiced, like anything else.

### Keep a Journal For Life

Writing in a journal is a sure way to force yourself to narrate your
thoughts, and thus think more &#151; and eventually more clearly. Once you
learn vim, keep a journal for life. One file, for the rest of your life.
You'll be amazed the changes this will induce. Keeping a journal ain't easy.
Push past the hard bits.

### Use the 80/20-Rule

This is the corollary to pushing past the hard bits. Know when to bank your
winnings and move on. Twenty percent of the time and effort you might be
willing to put into something produces eighty percent of the results you're
looking for. Beyond that, diminishing returns sets in. The pursuit of
perfection squanders precious resources.

In other-words, always try to front-load your efforts with the most important
parts first, so that if you had to quit only 1/5th of the way in, you still
will have won by getting out of it most of what you intended.

### Escaping Rabbit-Holes

The world is full of Wonderlands. There are rabbit holes everywhere, and many
white rabbits luring us in. Some rabbit holes run very deep, and once entered
there's no escaping. Be able to identify when you're going down a rabbit
hole and if it seems dangerous, watch your step and be able to back out again
quickly. You can lose yourself down there for the rest of your life.

If that's what you want, fine. It may even be what you're looking for in
life. Just be aware. It's the skill of rabbit hole awareness and evaluation.
If you're unsure, give it a try, but leave a spelunker string-line if you
feel you may get lost and need to find your way out again.

### The Delicate Balance & Deliberation of Life

Everything is the way it is because of a delicate balance between forces that
let something interesting stabilize in the middle. Orbiting planets are like
this. The magnetic force that makes matter lump up is like that. A little too
far towards either order or chaos kills life. We exist right at the vibrating
edge... razor-thin boundaries. We live in highly fine-tuned space.

This vibrating front between order and chaos allows for us. Within this
narrow band of viability, tiny differences are amplified all the more.
Although most things invariably exist on some spectrum... shades of grey...
steps on a scale or what have you, much appears black and white.

Thresholds over which you get categorized are what ultimately matter. Was the
egg fertilized or not? Did they survive the accident or didn't they? Is a cat
in the picture or not? These binary distinctions are not made-up. They are
just not the whole picture, and they are certainly not the norm, nor always
desirable.

Keep your options open when you can. Don't let others force you to label,
categorize and pigeonhole yourself based on false yes or no questions &#151;
false dichotomies.

### Fear Makes More Money Than Peace

The headline says it all. Opponents of peace hold power because their hatred of
a settled-down time wherein anyone has enough time to ascend to higher social
ranks terrifies those who currently hold power. I believe there is enough
evidence that the public at large is indeed "held down". But times are
achangin.
