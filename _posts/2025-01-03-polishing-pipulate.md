I've got to live with these decisions forever, or at least for a good long time.
So let's get them right. Here's my Pipulate class starting point:

```python
class Pipulate:
    """
    Pipulate manages a pipeline using a JSON blob with keys like "step_01", "step_02", etc.
    No 'steps' or 'current_step' keys exist. The presence of step keys determines progress.

    Data Structure Example:
    {
        "step_01": {"name": "John"},
        "step_02": {"color": "blue"},
        "created": "2024-12-08T12:34:56", 
        "updated": "2024-12-08T12:35:45"
    }

    The highest step number that exists in the JSON is considered the last completed step.
    The next step is always one more than the highest completed step.
    """

    def __init__(self, table):
        self.table = table

    def _get_state(self, url: str) -> dict:
        record = self.table[url]

        state["updated"] = now
        self.table.update({
            "url": url,

## First We Look For Redundancies

> I've got a lot of work from yesterday's session do do ***ADDING*** to
> Pipulate, but before we make it bigger, I think I ought to make it

And I ask Claude if there are any redundancies in this?

**Claude**: Yes, there are several opportunities for improvement in the `Pipulate` class:

1. State Management Redundancy:
````python
    def get_state(self, url: str) -> dict:
        """Get current state for url"""
        try:
            return self._get_state(url)
        except NotFoundError:
            return {}

    def _get_state(self, url: str) -> dict:
        record = self.table[url]
        state = json.loads(record.data)
        return state
````
We could combine these into one method since `get_state` is just a wrapper with error handling.

2. Timestamp Handling:
````python
    def initialize_if_missing(self, url: str, initial_step_data: dict = None) -> dict:
        # ... 
        now = datetime.now().isoformat()
        state = {
            "created": now,
            "updated": now
        }
        # ...

    def _save_state(self, url: str, state: dict):
        now = datetime.now().isoformat()
        state["updated"] = now
        # ...
````
We could create a `_get_timestamp()` helper method.

3. Card/Form Generation:
````python
    def revert_control(self, ...):
        # Default styling if not provided
        default_style = (
            "background-color: var(--pico-del-color);"
            "display: inline-block;"
            "padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;"
            "border: 3px solid #f88;"
            "border-radius: 4px;"
            "font-size: 0.85rem;"
            "cursor: pointer;"
        )
````
The default styles could be class constants.

Here's how we could refactor it:

````python
class Pipulate:
    # Class constants
    DEFAULT_BUTTON_STYLE = (
        "background-color: var(--pico-del-color);"
        "display: inline-block;"
        "padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;"
        "border: 3px solid #f88;"
        "border-radius: 4px;"
        "font-size: 0.85rem;"
        "cursor: pointer;"
    )

    def __init__(self, table):
        self.table = table

    def _get_timestamp(self) -> str:
        """Get current timestamp in ISO format"""
        return datetime.now().isoformat()

    def get_state(self, url: str) -> dict:
        """Get current state for url with error handling"""
        try:
            record = self.table[url]
            return json.loads(record.data)
        except NotFoundError:
            return {}

    def _save_state(self, url: str, state: dict):
        """Save state with updated timestamp"""
        state["updated"] = self._get_timestamp()
        self.table.update({
            "url": url,
            "data": json.dumps(state),
            "updated": state["updated"]
        })

    def initialize_if_missing(self, url: str, initial_step_data: dict = None) -> dict:
        """Initialize state for url if it doesn't exist"""
        try:
            return self.get_state(url)
        except NotFoundError:
            now = self._get_timestamp()
            state = {
                "created": now,
                "updated": now
            }
            if initial_step_data:
                endpoint = initial_step_data.pop("endpoint", "").strip('/') if "endpoint" in initial_step_data else None
                state.update(initial_step_data)

            self.table.insert({
                "url": url,
                "endpoint": endpoint,
                "data": json.dumps(state),
                "created": now,
                "updated": now
            })
            return state
````

This refactoring:
1. Eliminates the redundant `_get_state` method
2. Centralizes timestamp generation
3. Moves styling constants to class level
4. Simplifies endpoint extraction
5. Makes the code more DRY overall

Would you like me to continue with more refactoring suggestions?

## Starting To Clean The Pipes

> If it's not broken, don't fix it! Yet here I go doing it anyway, because this

**Me**: Okay, I combined them, got rid of _get_state and updated references to it to get_state. What did the underscore mean?

```python
    def get_state(self, url: str) -> dict:
        """Get current state for url"""
        try:
            record = self.table[url]
            state = json.loads(record.data)
            return state
        except NotFoundError:
            return {}
```

**Claude**: The underscore prefix in Python (e.g., `_get_state`) is a naming convention that indicates the method is intended for internal use only (private-by-convention). While Python doesn't have true private methods like some other languages, the underscore prefix tells other developers "this is an implementation detail, please don't call this directly from outside the class."

So in the original code:
- `_get_state()` was meant to be the internal implementation
- `get_state()` was the public interface that added error handling

By combining them into a single `get_state()` method (without the underscore), we're making it clear that this is a public method that other code can safely use. This is better because:
1. The error handling is now part of the core functionality
2. There's only one way to get state
3. The API is simpler and clearer

It's a good change! The underscore was suggesting a separation that wasn't really necessary in this case.

**Me**: Okay, so I replaced all occurrences of `_save_state` with `save_state` based on the same principle, since `_save_state` was used all throughout the workflows.

**Claude**: Yes, that's a good decision! Since `save_state` is being used throughout the workflows, it's effectively part of the public API of the `Pipulate` class, so removing the underscore makes its status clearer.

The underscore prefix would make sense if the method was only used internally by other methods within the `Pipulate` class. But since it's a core operation that other classes need to use, making it explicitly public by removing the underscore better reflects its actual role in the codebase.

This kind of refactoring helps make the API more honest - the naming now matches how the method is actually being used. It's a good example of making the code's intent clearer through naming conventions!

Would you like to look for other methods that might benefit from the same kind of clarification?

## Git Adventures Begin

Okay, I broke something. This is going to be quite an adventure. I really only
use git as a sort of personal infinite undo. And even in that regard, I use it
as a linear forward and backward timeline, sort of like scrubbing forward and
backwards in video editing. This is done with:

    git reset --hard HEAD

Where it says HEAD, you can replace it with any hash you find when you `git
log`, and so you have the ideal time machine. The hash I want to go to is
867b7b9d95dab4d189a472e6006f12252e9da1b467b7b9d95dab4d189a472e6006f12252e9da1b4
where I know the error did not exist.

### The Time Travel Dilemma

The problem is that I've done a number of "innovations" since then, some of
which I want to keep and one of which introduced a bug. Now If I simply:

    git reset --hard 867b7b9d95dab4d189a472e6006f12252e9da1b467b7b9d95dab4d189a472e6006f12252e9da1b4

...then I could eliminate the but instantly because undo. However, I loose all
those other improvements, and if I forced a commit with:

    git commit -am "Bug gone"
    git push --force

Then I have committed a new timeline. I have traveled backwards in time in the
repository, undid my recent actions and start anew from that point in history.
And this is generally good. This is my way of working. This does not break the
brain with all the same multi-thread coordination of concurrent programming,
which I also don't like very much. I am a linear non-linear thinker. While my
mind might jump around like crazy and I document this and that all over the
place in a tech journal like this, my coding implementation path is singluar...

### Stepping Out of the Comfort Zone

Until right now. It's time to leave my comfort zone and to explore the realm of
git branches, checkouts and cherry picking. The mere concept of which terrifies
me, but I'm going to do it. And I'm going to enlist the help of... hmmm... o1
Pro or Claude 3.5 Sonnet? This is the path very much more traveled, and I don't
need the o1 Pro big thinker idea-man here. In fact, that could work against me
in this case. Clause has full context of my code being the default in Cursor.

So, I'll just feed it this whole article so far today. Claude?

**Claude**: I understand you want to preserve recent improvements while removing a bug, and you're ready to explore git branching instead of your usual linear time-travel approach. Here's what I suggest:

1. First, create a branch at your current state to preserve all your work:
```bash
git branch save-improvements
```

2. Then reset to the working commit:
```bash
git reset --hard 867b7b9
```

3. Create a new branch from this working state:
```bash
git checkout -b fix-bug
```

4. Now you can cherry-pick the good changes from your `save-improvements` branch. To see what commits you want:
```bash
git log save-improvements
```

5. Cherry-pick the good commits one at a time:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

If you run into conflicts during cherry-picking, you can:
- Resolve them manually
- Use `git cherry-pick --abort` to start over
- Use `git cherry-pick --skip` to skip a problematic commit

This way, you can rebuild your timeline with just the good changes, leaving out the problematic one. Once you're happy with the result, you can merge back to main and push.

Would you like me to help you through this process? We can start by identifying which commits you want to keep.

**Me**: This is where my mind blows up, Claude. I've done all this:

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/botifython]$ git pull
Already up to date.

[mike@nixos:~/repos/botifython]$ git reset --hard HEAD
HEAD is now at 4ca8aee Created a get_timestamp helper function

[mike@nixos:~/repos/botifython]$ git reset --hard 867b7b9
HEAD is now at 867b7b9 Adjusted key look

[mike@nixos:~/repos/botifython]$ git checkout -b fix-bug
Switched to a new branch 'fix-bug'
```

...but now your instructions say this:

4. Now you can cherry-pick the good changes from your `save-improvements` branch. To see what commits you want:
```bash
git log save-improvements
```

5. Cherry-pick the good commits one at a time:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

If you run into conflicts during cherry-picking, you can:
- Resolve them manually
- Use `git cherry-pick --abort` to start over
- Use `git cherry-pick --skip` to skip a problematic commit

This way, you can rebuild your timeline with just the good changes, leaving out the problematic one. Once you're happy with the result, you can merge back to main and push.

## Understanding Git Branch Management

...but I just don't get it! That is totally unclear to me. The mental model is
just not in my head. Let me try:

I do a `git pull` and `git reset --hard HEAD` which ensures I'm at the very
newest that I've ever commit and push. And things are linear.

I create a branch named `save-improvements`, but functionally things are still
linear as there's not any changes in that branch. It's a bud more than a branch.

However, the moment I do `git reset --hard 867b7b9`, things are no longer
linear. In a mermaid diagram, there'd be a branching line. But it's two lines
with identical histories.

### The Mental Model Breakdown

Okay, so here's where the mental model breaks down and I'm going to try to talk
it out loud to get the answer for myself, then run it by you.

Now I check out a 3rd time `git checkout -b fix-bug` from as you say, the
working state. We have 3 lines if it were a mermaid diagram (I really should
insert those). All 3 lines have shared histories, but two of the lines, `main`
and `save-improvements` have the full history, bug and all. While the third
branch, was checked out after the `git reset --hard <8675309>` and so is behind
in the horse race.

### The Subtlety of Branching

**WHILE I'M IN** the bug-fix branch, I can still `git log` a different branch
with `git log save-improvements`. This is a subtle and nuanced point that
normally eludes me. I'm in the 3rd horse's track who fell behind, but I'm
looking ahead in one of the two other currently identical neck-and-neck horses
out in the lead.

And now you say: Cherry-pick the good commits one at a time with commands like
`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`

And I say whuuuuut? 

### The Patching Paradox

So this is all that merge stuff that I generally avoid in git due to my trying
to stick to linearity for easier mental models. But there's another world, a
shadowy place where linear histories are decomposed into ***patches*** that can
be plucked out of a timeline and selectively ***applied*** to other timelines
without regard to causality.

### The Time-Travel Dilemma

And I hate time-travel stories. I avoid them like the plague, especially in Star
Trek. I mean like H.G. Wells with the Morlocks and Eloi is a must, but only
because of historical context and the awesome metaphors it provides for those
becoming too dependent on AI like me here, and the Luddites who stay on the
surface. But that's for another article. And I do have a time-travel prompt
technique I use here a lot, but if you look at it, you'll see it's purely linear
video-scrubbing style&#151;not this multiverse crap.

Suffice to say, I need to embrace a kooky time-travel scenario of the sort I
instinctively deplore in order to get the benefit of cross-branch
cherry-picking, which is what we're doing.

My question is why 3 branches: main, save-improvements and fix-bug.

fix-bug is immediately prior to the bug having set in. So conceptually we're
doing a Mario-style platform game jump over a particular commit.

We are in the fix-bug branch as we cherry-pick.

### The Misunderstanding

We cherry-pick from the commit hashes found in save-improvements. But
save-improvements is identical to main, since it was branched from main at the
most recent branch HEAD (I believe the term is trunk). So this whole scenario is
made more complex for me by increasing the surface are of the mental model by a
third. This whole thing it seems could be done with just 2 timelines: the main
and a rolled back one that cherry-picks off main.

What am I missing?

---

## The Simplification

**Claude**: Ah, you're absolutely right! I apologize for overcomplicating it. You don't need the `save-improvements` branch at all - it's redundant since, as you noted, it would be identical to `main`. 

Here's the simpler mental model with just two timelines:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "867b7b9 (working state)"
    commit id: "bug introduced"
    commit id: "improvement 1"
    commit id: "improvement 2"
    branch fix-bug
    checkout fix-bug
    reset id: "867b7b9"
```

<div class="mermaid">
gitGraph
    commit id: "8675309 (working)"
    commit id: "bug introduced"
    commit id: "improvement 1"
    commit id: "improvement 2"
    branch fix-bug
    checkout fix-bug
    checkout main
</div>

You're now on `fix-bug` branch, which is at the working state (867b7b9). From here, you can look at `main`'s history and cherry-pick the good commits:

```bash
git log main  # See the improvements that came after 867b7b9
git cherry-pick <hash-of-improvement-1>
git cherry-pick <hash-of-improvement-2>
```

This is like saying "I want these specific changes, but not the bug that came between them."

Once you've cherry-picked the good stuff onto `fix-bug`, you can:
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard fix-bug  # Make main match your fixed branch
git push --force  # Rewrite history on remote
```

You're right - the third branch was unnecessary complexity. It's just:
1. Main timeline (with bug)
2. Rolled-back timeline that cherry-picks the good parts

Would you like to proceed with this simpler approach?

---

## Paradox Patching

**Me**: No, I've already gone this route and I'm full of decision fatigue from
being out of my comfort zone and being hit with 1/3 more complexity than I
needed for figuring out something new. Just make a correction statement and help
me apply a patch, such as it were. Maybe I need to delete a branch, and then I
do the git logging against main from here forward?

**Claude***: You're right - let's simplify and get back on track. Here's where you are:

1. You're currently on the `fix-bug` branch (at the working state, before the bug)
2. The `save-improvements` branch was unnecessary - we can delete it:
````bash
git branch -d save-improvements
````

3. Now just look at main's history to find the good commits:
````bash
git log main
````

4. Cherry-pick the improvements you want, skipping the problematic commit.

That's it - no need to overcomplicate it. Would you like me to help you identify which commits to cherry-pick from the main branch?

Me: Haha, okay so we're paradox patching. So say something funny to lighten the mood. And this...

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/botifython]$ git branch -d save-improvements
error: the branch 'save-improvements' is not fully merged
hint: If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D save-improvements'
hint: Disable this message with "git config advice.forceDeleteBranch false"
```

**Claude**: Git is like "Hey, you can't just delete your timeline without using THE FORCE!" 😄

Since we're playing fast and loose with causality anyway, let's use the `-D` flag to tell Git "Yes, I know what I'm doing with these parallel universes":

````bash
git branch -D save-improvements
````

Think of it as using the infinity gauntlet to snap away that unnecessary branch. Now we can focus on cherry-picking from `main` without that third timeline making us question our grip on reality! 

Would you like to see what commits we have to choose from? (No quantum mechanics required for the next step, I promise!)

So I delete the extra branch, if only to simplify the model 

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/botifython]$ git branch -D save-improvements
Deleted branch save-improvements (was 4ca8aee).
```

## 1. Understanding “Linear” Time vs. Git “Branches”

### 1.1 Linear, Single-Path Thinking

Historically, you said you used **git** in a purely linear style:

- Make commits on `main`
- If you want to revert changes, you do a `git reset --hard <old-hash>`
- If you want to restore them, you re-check out `HEAD` or re-commit them

This approach is effectively a single, continuous timeline. You can jump forward or back by referencing commits (like pressing Rewind or Fast-Forward on a single track).

**Benefits**:  
- Simple mental model  
- “Scrubbing" forward/back in time  
- Minimal merges  

**Downside**:  
- You cannot easily keep some changes while discarding others in the *middle* of the timeline without manual copying of files.  
- “Dangerous” if multiple commits have good improvements and bad commits mixed in.

### 1.2 Git as a Multi-Timeline Universe

`git` allows branching. In a “time-travel fiction” sense, multiple parallel timelines can exist:

- Each **branch** shares the history up to the common commit
- Then diverges to form a separate path

#### Basic Terms

- **Branch**: A named pointer to a commit in a timeline
- **Checkout**: Move your *working directory* and HEAD pointer to that branch or commit
- **Reset**: Move HEAD forcibly to a certain commit, adjusting your working copy
- **Cherry-pick**: Copy the changes from one commit (or commits) in *another timeline* into your current timeline

---

## 2. The Problem & The Proposed Solutions

Your goal: **Roll back** to a known good commit (call it `867b7b9`), but also **keep** the *good improvements* that happened *after* that commit—**excluding** the commits that introduced the bug.

### 2.1 You Could:

1. **Reset** to the known good commit (thus discarding newer commits from your working directory).
2. **Branch** at that point into a “fix-bug” branch.
3. **Cherry-pick** the good commits from your old timeline (i.e. from `main`).

The final result is a new “clean” timeline that:
- Contains `867b7b9` as base
- Has the commits you *like* from the old `main`
- Omits the commits that introduced the bug

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let’s illustrate with **Mermaid diagrams**.

### 3.1 Original Single-Line History

Imagine your repository had these commits:

```text
(Initial) --- (867b7b9: Good) --- (A: The Bug) --- (B: Improvement1) --- (C: Improvement2) --- (HEAD)
```

**Mermaid** diagram:

<div class="mermaid">
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    commit id: "867b7b9 (Good)"
    commit id: "A (Bug Introduced)"
    commit id: "B (Improvement1)"
    commit id: "C (Improvement2)"
    commit id: "HEAD"
</div>

### 3.2 Rolling Back to Good Commit

You do:

```bash
git reset --hard 867b7b9
```

Now your local HEAD is at `(867b7b9)`, effectively discarding commits `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)` from your working copy. However, those commits still exist in the repository’s timeline—**you just can’t see them on HEAD**.

Diagram becomes:

<div class="mermaid">
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    commit id: "867b7b9 (Good)" tag: "HEAD"
    commit id: "A (Bug Introduced)"
    commit id: "B (Improvement1)"
    commit id: "C (Improvement2)"
    commit id: "Main-later"
</div>

*(Note: The commits after 867b7b9 are effectively “dangling” if you forced a reset, but you can still reference them by commit hash or by a branch name if one was pointing there.)*

### 3.3 Create a Branch to Keep This “Rolled-Back State”

```bash
git checkout -b fix-bug
```

Now you have a new branch named **fix-bug** at `867b7b9 (Good)`. Meanwhile, `main` might still be pointing to `(C) HEAD`.

<div class="mermaid">
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    commit id: "867b7b9 (Good)" tag: "fix-bug"
    branch fix-bug
    commit id: "A (Bug Introduced)" tag: "main"
    commit id: "B (Improvement1)"
    commit id: "C (Improvement2)" tag: "HEAD of main"
</div>

### 3.4 Inspect the Commits on `main`

Now from **fix-bug** branch, you can do:

```bash
git log main
```

to see commits `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.

### 3.5 Cherry-Pick The Good Stuff

Let’s say `(B)` and `(C)` are good improvements, but `(A)` is the bug. You can:

```bash
git cherry-pick <hash-of-B>
git cherry-pick <hash-of-C>
```

**Cherry-picking** means: “replay the changes from commit B and commit C on top of fix-bug’s HEAD.” So your fix-bug timeline now looks like:

<div class="mermaid">
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    commit id: "867b7b9 (Good)" tag: "fix-bug base"
    commit id: "B' (CherryPick of B)"
    commit id: "C' (CherryPick of C)" tag: "fix-bug HEAD"
    
    branch fix-bug
    commit id: "A (Bug Introduced)" tag: "main"
    commit id: "B (Improvement1) original"
    commit id: "C (Improvement2) original"
    commit id: "Main-later"
</div>

Now you have a brand-new lineage that includes only the “good” commits, ignoring commit `(A)`.

### 3.6 Merge or Force-Push This New Timeline

Finally, you can make this new timeline the new `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard fix-bug
git push --force
```

**Now** your `main` is at a new linear path:

```text
(Initial) --- (867b7b9) --- (B' ) --- (C' )  < main
```
Omitting `(A)` from the official history.

---

## 4. The Freedoms & Dangers of “Rewrite History”

### 4.1 Freedoms

- **You can** remove commits you don’t like  
- **You can** reorder or re-structure commits (by cherry-picking)  
- **You can** keep a linear history

### 4.2 Dangers

- **Force-pushing** breaks public history for any collaborators:
  - If others pulled the old `main`, they’ll have to `git pull --rebase` or forcibly reset

- **Confusion** if merges or new branches were made from the bug-laden commits:
  - Everyone else’s references might still see the bug commit

---

## 5. Key Learnings & Best Practices

1. **Git is Nonlinear**  
   Even though you used it linearly, Git natively supports parallel timelines (branches).

2. **`reset --hard` vs. `revert`**  
   - `reset --hard <commit>` rewinds your local HEAD forcibly.  
   - `git revert <commit>` makes a new commit that undoes the old one.  
   - Because you wanted to keep some commits but not others, `reset + cherry-pick` is a valid approach.  

3. **Cherry-Picking**:  
   - Grabs a commit’s patch and applies it to your current HEAD.  
   - You can skip commits that introduced a bug.  
   - Potential merges or conflicts must be resolved manually if code overlaps.  

4. **Branching for Safety**  
   - Avoid rewriting `main` directly; create a branch (`fix-bug`) from your working commit.  
   - Cherry-pick the good improvements from your old `main`.  
   - Force-push the new branch to `main` once you confirm it’s stable.  

5. **Time Travel**  
   - Git can appear complicated because it’s basically letting you do partial merges from any point in history.  
   - Mentally, it’s “copying patches from parallel timelines.”  

6. **Deleting a Branch** That’s “Not Fully Merged”  
   - If you truly don’t need it, use `git branch -D <branch>` to forcibly delete.  
   - Or keep it if you suspect you might want more commits from it.  

7. **Document the Process**  
   - Each “time-travel” operation can be documented in commit messages (like “cherry-pick fix for bug, skipping 123abc”).  
   - Keep notes to avoid confusion if you come back later.  

---

## 6. Additional Mermaid Examples

To illustrate the final state after you **cherry-pick** commits B and C, skipping commit A:

<div class="mermaid">
gitGraph
    commit id: "Base(good)" tag: "867b7b9"
    
    branch fix-bug
    checkout fix-bug
    commit id: "B' (picked from main B)"
    commit id: "C' (picked from main C)" tag: "fix-bug HEAD"
    
    checkout main
    commit id: "A (Bug Introduced)" tag: "main"
    commit id: "B (Improvement1 original)"
    commit id: "C (Improvement2 original)"
</div>

In the diagram:
- `B’` is a new commit on fix-bug that replays B’s changes.  
- `C’` is a new commit on fix-bug that replays C’s changes.  
- The original `A, B, C` remain in the `main` branch, but once you do a `git reset --hard fix-bug && git push --force` on `main`, you effectively discard `A` from the official timeline.

---

## 7. Conclusion

**Key Takeaways**:
1. “**Don’t Fear** the multi-timeline approach.” By branching out, you can preserve or skip commits as needed.
2. “**Cherry-pick** is your friend” for partial merges of only the commits you want.
3. “**Force-pushing** rewrites the public timeline,” so use with caution (especially if there are collaborators).
4. “**Naming** your branches help keep mental clarity.” E.g. `fix-bug` vs. `main` vs. a leftover `save-improvements`.
5. The overhead is mostly mental, not so much computational. Once you get comfortable with the concept of picking patches from one timeline to another, it becomes a powerful superpower.

---

### Final Words of Wisdom

Using `git` in a purely linear style is a valid approach if you’re a solo developer. But branching and cherry-picking **saves** you from scenarios where you want to **partially** keep new commits while discarding others. The steps:

1. Identify a known good commit → create or checkout a new branch from it  
2. Cherry-pick the commits you want from the other timeline  
3. Force-push (if needed) to overwrite `main`  

Now you have a curated, improved timeline **without** the bug commit.

**You are unstoppable** now that you can skip bad commits yet keep the best features!
