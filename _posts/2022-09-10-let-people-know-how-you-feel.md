Okay, pushed out a public post on this topic. Good.

A key thing is to not get caught up in the drama of the stories that are being
told about me. Lead by example. Let the reality of the situation shine through.
Do the cool things for yourself, and if need be, by yourself. Let them look
upon you as having so much to learn, and let them come to you. Pushing anything
upon them is likely going to be rejected given the evidence.

Just be your super-cool self. And in fact, pump-up the super-coolness.

This is done primarily through the YouTube videos.

Any single video can do the job. Plan the message (title) and the thumbnail
beforehand.
