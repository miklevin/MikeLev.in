headline: "Staying Organized: Keeping Projects in ~/github as Time Flies By"
description: As February 15th, 2022 quickly approaches, I'm thankful that I have been able to stay organized and keep track of all my projects stored in the ~/github folder. However, I need to stay vigilant in my organizing efforts to make sure the folder doesn't get too cluttered and disorganized.

Boy how time flies. At least this approach is proving to me the ABILITY to have
continuity if not consistency. These repo folders all under ~/github make the
master list of projects easy to skim through, so long as they are not too
numerous. Folder propagation inside ~/github is a potential problem I need to
keep an eye on. There's need for organization and pruning. Speaking of which
