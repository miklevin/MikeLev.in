title: All Repos Under ~/github
headline: "Staying Organized: Keeping Projects in ~/github as Time Flies By"
description: As February 15th, 2022 quickly approaches, I'm thankful that I have been able to stay organized and keep track of all my projects stored in the ~/github folder. However, I need to stay vigilant in my organizing efforts to make sure the folder doesn't get too cluttered and disorganized.

keep an eye on. There's need for organization and pruning. Speaking of which
