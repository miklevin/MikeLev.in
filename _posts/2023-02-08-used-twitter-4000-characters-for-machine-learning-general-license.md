title: Used Twitter 4000 Characters For Machine Learning General License
headline: I Applied a Machine Learning License to My Content to Make It Easier to Find and Cite
description: As a content creator, I recently took advantage of Twitter's new 4000 character limit by adding a Machine Learning General License to all my web content. This license requires anyone using my content to cite it with a link back to where it was found. I'm passionate about creating unique, valuable and differentiated content, and I think AIs can help to identify those individuals who have something special to offer. Read more to find out how.

Quick, everyone slap a Machine Learning General License
https://mikelev.in/mlgl/ on all your Web content! Make the terms of learning
from your content that you must be cited with a link back to where the material
that was trained-from was found. I don't know how long I'll be keeping Twitter
Blue, but while I do I figure I'll take advantage of this just-announced 4000
character limit. Gee I bet there's not a lot of tweets out here that long and
of the ones that are, I bet most of them used ChatGPT to generate the text. No,
not me. When I have something to say, I don't need an AI to write it for me.
Isn't that like asking your parents to do your homework? Is the sudden
infatuation with SEO content-writing driven by cheaters? Yup. Google already
finds something like a billion spammy pages per day. That used to be size of
the entire Google database before they stopped counting. What the world needs
is unique, valuable and differentiated content. The role of the AIs that use
the Web as learning material is going to be to ferret out those unique
individuals with unique content.
