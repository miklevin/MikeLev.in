title: Do Not Lose The Power of Touch Typing Despite AI APIs
headline: Master Machines and Express Your Inner Vibe - Don't Lose the Power of Touch Typing!
description: As a tech enthusiast, I believe that touch typing on a standard keyboard is still an important skill to learn and practice, even in the age of smartphones and AI. Touchscreens can't provide the same muscle memory as a standard keyboard, and touch typing is a great way to express your inner vibe. Don't let the power of touch typing be lost - learning this highly useful skill is key to mastering machines and taking control of your life.

The ability to actually do a thing is often looked down upon, due either to
jealousy or a classist attitude, neither of which are good reasons to not learn
how to do a thing.

It's better to lean how to do a thing and be looked down upon by those who can
not than it is to inhibit yourself for their approval or acceptance. So go
learn! Go do!

Or stay right here to learn and do, because in the modern Information Age,
actualizing can be done remarkably comfortably at a terminal with a keyboard.
This is a fundamental ability in life that should not be lost on modern youth
because of the popularity of smartphones and their onscreen thumb-keyboards and
voice recognition.

Much power comes from learning how to touch type and then by getting good at it
through practice over time.

Touchscreens work against full-speed muscle memory due to their shifting
layouts. If you want to get better at something over time that relies greatly
on little-changing interfaces, a standard keyboard for typing is one of
history's great examples. Another example of long-unchanging interfaces in tech
is driving. One must master a series of hand or foot moves to result in control
of a machine that should operate like an extension of your body.

There is a certain oneness with tools this soon ends up being about. It is
where much of the “love for a thing” actually resides. Because tools are like
extensions of our body, and the innovations of new ones are incorporated into
our very being, one must make their taking-up, study and mastery into an
important topic. Life's too short to take up the wrong tools too often, and
only all the more so if they're not your vibe.

Your essential inner vibe is the music of you as expressed first by your
hardware. This is a certain unlikely arrangement of encoded data that is deeply
interdependent with the system capable of “running the code”. When your code
starts running, you are a floating mass of dividing cells. Even after birth you
are so helpless you can't even hold your own head up for a few weeks.

This made you very vulnerable once, yet this vulnerability does not define you.
In due course of life, you've taken control of your own life, at least enough
so to define yourself. There's major philosophical splits in humanity here over
this. I believe that once you're truly self-aware, you control enough of your
own experiences that you can override the “default” paths and plot some new and
a sometimes surprising ones. Much in life that makes it worth living comes from
overriding the cocksure-ness of super determinism. I mean, who could have seen
everything coming?

Social mammals such as us start out very trusting not out of choice. Our
parents, colony or tribe have had to have made the choice to keep you alive.
Now you're alive under your own volition, but how scary is that? You're part of
a system whose stability comes wholly from the ability of one generation to
hand things down from one generation to the encryption. Can you imagine the
“whisper down the lane” drift?

How much that is just taken for granted by one generation was the “landing in
the moon” miracle to the prior generation. It's that way with smartphones and
the Internet today. These are like Harry Potter magic wands suddenly introduced
into our lives. Our mundane Muggle-world is now itself magical.

Todays youth expect quality voice recognition built into mobile touchscreen
keyboards, which are increasingly their main way of interacting with
technology. I mean who even needs to even be in front of a larger screen with a
keyboard anyway? The augmented and virtual reality interfaces of tomorrow go a
similar way as mobile, because while haptics and chambers could enhance the VR
experience, it doesn't rival always being in you like mobile is today.

While there is some truth to this statement, why what for for increasingly
parental AIs to take over just to avoid developing a highly useful skill?
That's like arguing to stay a baby.
