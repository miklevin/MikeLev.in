Not everything you think you've fallen in love with has to survive, be featured
in your life, get shown on your website, live on in your prayers or whatever.

It's not an easy pull to swallow, but reinventing yourself as you see fit can
sometimes only happen when you paint over the canvas, and that's okay. Take a
snapshot of the prior paintings if you need, but them throw them in the archive
for the occasional rosy reminiscence.

It's fine to reminisce if it's only for fun and you keep it in perspective.
Such activity literally lets them back into your lives. Consider for a moment
the possibility of the eternal soul. Entertain the notion that we may all be
different versions of the same being. Are you still okay with what you're
doing? Okay, then we're good.

We're born not knowing shit—but maybe perhaps some little inkling based on our
22 trait-bundles of our chromosome pairs inherited randomly from one or the
other of our parents. There's that vibe, then there's the vibe in the womb and
the vibe of the circumstances you're popped out into. Still for the most part,
you don't know shit.

And so sometimes you become a little shit. You might. It think so now, but
absolutely horrid behavior is unsustainable. It will catch up with you and
wrack your soul. From 25 to 28 years old sensitive artistic-types who've been
dishonest with themselves clock-out, no matter how much material success
they've enjoyed. It's the great twenty-eight. I could quote musicians out the
wazoo, but for me it's Reddit founder Aaron Swartz. It's not merely mental
imbalance. It's a snap-back effect from realization of life decision behavior
that's too crushing for sensitive types.

Survive. We all go through some variety of the great twenty-eights. Be
deliberately callous and insensitive at times. That doesn't make you bad. It
makes you a survivor, and life is good and worth living, and so protecting
yourself emotionally actually makes you good too. Grey stone on, my friend!

Anyone accusing you of being an a-hole for protecting yourself during such
times is the true a-hole. It's called projection. They've found certain
behavior to work well for themselves, evoking sympathy and attention. Seeing
others exhibit such behavior, or poses an immunity to it, pisses them off to no
end. It's an immediate “trigger” and gets their accusations flying. Listen
closely. It's actually them telling you what they hate most about themselves.
They live inside their heads, in denial, and quickly protect their fragile egos
by projecting outwards onto others any feelings that strike a chord and get
close to the heart of their own issues.

Once upon a time you had more reason to be satisfied with the lot you were
given in life. You were born somewhere into the social hierarchy of a tribal
society of probably around 100 creatures, not too dissimilar from chimps.
