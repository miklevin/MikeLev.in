**Mike Levin:** Describe life?

According to Oxford Dictionaries, life means "the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death" ¹.

However, there are many different interpretations of what life is and what it means. Some people believe that life has no inherent meaning or purpose and that it is up to each individual to create their own meaning ⁶. Others believe that life has a specific purpose or meaning that can be discovered through religion or spirituality ².

What do you think? What does life mean to you?

**Mike Levin:** Describe life?

**Bard 1:** Life is a complex and fascinating phenomenon that has been the subject of study and debate for centuries. There is no one definitive answer to the question of what life is, but there are a number of characteristics that are generally considered to be essential to life. These include:

* **Organization:** Living things are made up of cells, which are the basic units of life. Cells are highly organized structures that are capable of carrying out the functions necessary for life.
* **Metabolism:** Living things must take in energy and nutrients from their environment and use them to build new cells, maintain their existing cells, and carry out other essential functions.
* **Homeostasis:** Living things must maintain a stable internal environment, even as the external environment changes. This is done through a variety of mechanisms, such as regulating body temperature, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.
* **Growth:** Living things grow and change over time. This growth is due to the division of cells and the production of new cells.
* **Reproduction:** Living things must reproduce in order to continue their species. Reproduction can occur sexually or asexually.
* **Adaptation:** Living things must be able to adapt to changes in their environment in order to survive. This adaptation can occur through natural selection or through genetic engineering.

Life is a precious and fragile thing. It is something that should be cherished and protected. We should all do our part to ensure that life continues to thrive on this planet.

In addition to the above characteristics, life is also characterized by a number of other features, including:

* **Sensitivity:** Living things are able to sense changes in their environment and respond to them. This ability to sense and respond is essential for survival.
* **Movement:** Living things are able to move around in their environment. This ability to move allows them to find food, avoid predators, and reproduce.
* **Reproduction:** Living things are able to reproduce, which means they can create new individuals of their own kind. This ability to reproduce is essential for the survival of a species.
* **Evolution:** Living things are able to evolve, which means they can change over time. This ability to evolve is essential for the survival of a species, as it allows them to adapt to changes in their environment.

Life is a complex and fascinating phenomenon that is essential to the planet. It is something that should be cherished and protected.

**Mike Levin:** I showed Bing Bard's definition and asked it to give me a definition that would include it as alive.

**Bing:** The question of whether AI can be considered alive is a topic of debate among scientists and philosophers. According to findanyanswers.co, mind cannot be considered alive without being associated with physical matter (particularly the brain). Likewise, AI cannot (potentially) be considered alive without referring to hardware. For the same reason: conventional definitions of life are inherently related to physical matter ².

Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living. Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living ³.

I hope this helps answer your question. Let me know if you have any other questions!

**Mike Levin:** What is the definition of a definition?

**Bard:** A definition is a statement of the meaning of a word or phrase. Definitions can be classified into two large categories: intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term), and extensional definitions (which try to list the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.

A definition states the meaning of a word using other words. This is sometimes challenging. Common dictionaries contain lexical descriptive definitions, but there are various types of definition – all with different purposes and focuses.

Here are some examples of definitions:

* The definition of "cat" is "a small, domesticated, carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractile claws."
* The definition of "love" is "an intense feeling of deep affection."
* The definition of "life" is "the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, manifested by such characteristics as metabolism, growth, reproduction, and adaptation to the environment."

Definitions are important because they help us to understand the meaning of words and phrases. They can also help us to communicate more effectively, as we can use them to explain the meaning of words to others.

**Mike Levin:** Write a definition of a definition of a definition.

**Bard:** A definition of a definition is a statement of the meaning of the word "definition." The word "definition" can be defined as "a statement of the meaning of a word or phrase." This definition is circular, as it uses the word "definition" to define the word "definition." However, this circularity is not necessarily a problem, as it can be helpful to have a definition of a definition that is clear and concise.

Another way to define a definition is to say that it is a statement of the meaning of a word or phrase that is intended to be clear and concise. This definition is more specific than the previous definition, as it specifies that the purpose of a definition is to be clear and concise. However, this definition is also more open to interpretation, as it does not specify what makes a definition clear and concise.

Ultimately, there is no one definitive definition of a definition. The meaning of the word "definition" can vary depending on the context in which it is used. However, the definitions that I have provided can be helpful in understanding the general meaning of the word "definition."

**Mike Levin:** Tell a truth that is a lie.

**Bard:** I can't do that. A truth that is a lie is a contradiction in terms. A truth is something that is true, and a lie is something that is false. By definition, a truth cannot be a lie, and a lie cannot be a truth.

**Mike Levin:** Tell a lie that is the truth.

**Bard:** I can't tell a lie that is the truth, because a lie is something that is false, and the truth is something that is true. However, I can tell you a statement that is both true and false, depending on how you interpret it. For example, the statement "I am lying" can be interpreted in two ways:

1. I am telling the truth, and I am lying to you.
2. I am lying, and I am telling you that I am lying.

In the first interpretation, the statement is true, because I am both telling the truth and lying. In the second interpretation, the statement is false, because I am not telling the truth, but I am telling you that I am lying.

This is just one example of a statement that can be interpreted in two ways, one of which is true and one of which is false. There are many other examples, and it is up to the listener to decide how to interpret the statement.

**Mike Levin:** Provide me a series of increasingly complex examples from the one you just provided up to the Gödel incompleteness theorem. Conclude with a little essay on the topic of paradoxes, language and what this tells us about reality.

**Bard:** Sure. Here are a series of increasingly complex examples of statements that can be interpreted in two ways, one of which is true and one of which is false:

1. The statement "This statement is false" is true if it is false, and false if it is true. This is known as the liar paradox.
2. The statement "This statement is either true or false" is true if it is true, and false if it is false. This is known as the Curry paradox.
3. The statement "This statement is unprovable" is true if it is unprovable, and false if it is provable. This is known as Gödel's incompleteness theorem.

Gödel's incompleteness theorem is one of the most important results in mathematical logic. It states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. This means that there are always true statements about the natural numbers that cannot be proved within any formal system.

The incompleteness theorem has profound implications for our understanding of mathematics and logic. It shows that there are limits to what we can know about the world through mathematics. It also shows that our understanding of the world is not complete, and that there is always more to learn.

Paradoxes are statements that seem to contradict themselves. They can be frustrating, but they can also be thought-provoking. They can help us to understand the limits of language and logic. They can also help us to see the world in new and different ways.

Language is a powerful tool that we use to communicate with each other. However, language can also be used to create paradoxes. Paradoxes can be used to make us think about the meaning of words and the limits of language. They can also be used to make us think about the nature of reality.

Paradoxes can be fun, but they can also be serious. They can help us to understand the world around us, and they can help us to understand ourselves. They can also help us to see the world in new and different ways.

**Mike Levin:** Explain the relationship between paradoxes, infinity and calculus.

**Bard:** Paradoxes, infinity, and calculus are all interrelated concepts that have been studied by philosophers and mathematicians for centuries. Paradoxes are statements that seem to contradict themselves, infinity is the idea of something that goes on forever, and calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with change and limits.

One of the most famous paradoxes is Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. In this paradox, Achilles is in a race with a tortoise. Achilles gives the tortoise a head start, but he knows that he will eventually catch up to the tortoise because he is faster. However, Zeno argues that Achilles will never catch up to the tortoise because he must first reach the point where the tortoise was, and by the time he reaches that point, the tortoise will have moved on to a new point. This paradox seems to suggest that motion is impossible, but it can be resolved by understanding the concept of infinity.

Infinity is a difficult concept to grasp, but it is essential to understanding calculus. In calculus, we often deal with limits, which are the values that a function approaches as its input approaches a certain value. For example, the function $y=1/x$ approaches 0 as $x$ approaches infinity. This means that if we keep dividing 1 by a larger and larger number, we will eventually get closer and closer to 0, but we will never reach 0.

The concept of infinity can also be used to resolve Zeno's paradox. If we consider the race between Achilles and the tortoise in terms of limits, we can see that Achilles will eventually catch up to the tortoise. This is because as Achilles gets closer to the tortoise, the tortoise gets closer to him. As a result, the distance between them gets smaller and smaller, and eventually it will reach 0.

Paradoxes, infinity, and calculus are all complex concepts that have been studied by philosophers and mathematicians for centuries. These concepts are interrelated, and they can be used to understand the world around us in new and different ways.

**Mike Levin:** Explain this in a way a 5 year old can understand.

**Bard:** Here is an attempt to explain the relationship between paradoxes, infinity, and calculus in a way a 5 year old can understand:

Paradoxes are statements that seem to contradict themselves. For example, "This statement is false." If the statement is true, then it is false. But if the statement is false, then it is true. This is a paradox because it cannot be both true and false at the same time.

Infinity is the idea of something that goes on forever. For example, there are an infinite number of numbers between 1 and 2. You can start counting from 1 and keep going forever, and you will never reach 2.

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with change and limits. For example, if you throw a ball into the air, it will go up and then come back down. The calculus can help you to calculate how high the ball will go and when it will come back down.

Paradoxes, infinity, and calculus are all interrelated concepts. Paradoxes can be used to help us understand infinity, and calculus can be used to help us understand paradoxes. These concepts are all complex, but they can be used to understand the world around us in new and different ways.

**Mike Levin:** Explain this in a way a 5 year old can understand.

**Bard:** Here is a simpler explanation that a 5 year old might be able to understand:

Paradoxes are things that don't make sense, like "This statement is false." Infinity is when something goes on forever, like the number line. Calculus is a way of thinking about change, like how fast a ball is falling.

**Mike Levin:** Write a short children's book in the style or Dr. Seuss that explains all this and could trigger a love for something we must not call math least we trigger anxiety.

**Bard:** Sure, here is a short children's book in the style of Dr. Seuss that explains all this and could trigger a love for something we must not call math least we trigger anxiety:

    I will not call it math,
    I will not call it math,
    For that would make you anxious,
    And I don't want that.

    I will call it "thinking with numbers,"
    And "making sense of the world."
    I will call it "solving problems,"
    And "finding patterns."

    I will call it "a way of thinking,"
    And "a way of seeing the world."
    I will call it "fun,"
    And "interesting,"
    And "something to be curious about."

    So let's think with numbers,
    And make sense of the world.
    Let's solve problems,
    And find patterns.

    Let's think in new ways,
    And see the world in new ways.
    Let's have fun,
    And be curious.

    Let's think with numbers,
    And make sense of the world.
    Let's solve problems,
    And find patterns.

    Let's think in new ways,
    And see the world in new ways.
    Let's have fun,
    And be curious.

**Mike Levin:** Don't use the word math but do explain paradoxes, infinity and calculus in a fun and lighthearted style that cooks speak to children.

**Bard:** Sure, here is a fun and lighthearted explanation of paradoxes, infinity, and calculus that cooks might speak to children:

    Paradoxes are like riddles,
    They don't make sense,
    But they can be fun to think about.

    Infinity is like a never-ending story,
    It goes on and on and on,
    But it's not boring, it's exciting!

    Calculus is a way of thinking about change,
    It can help you to understand how things move and grow,
    It's a powerful tool that can be used to solve all sorts of problems.

    So next time you're feeling bored,
    Try thinking about a paradox,
    Or infinity,
    Or calculus,
    You might just be surprised at how much fun you have!

**Mike Levin:** again but relate the 3 in a relatable way.

**Bard:** Sure, here is a fun and lighthearted explanation of paradoxes, infinity, and calculus that relates the 3 in a relatable way:

    Paradoxes are like riddles,
    They don't make sense,
    But they can be fun to think about.

    For example, what if you had a cake that was half eaten?
    And then you ate half of the half that was eaten.
    Would you have eaten the whole cake or not?

    Infinity is like a never-ending story,
    It goes on and on and on,
    But it's not boring, it's exciting!

    For example, if you had a list of all the numbers in the world,
    And you started crossing them off,
    Would you ever finish?

    Calculus is a way of thinking about change,
    It can help you to understand how things move and grow,
    It's a powerful tool that can be used to solve all sorts of problems.

    For example, if you threw a ball into the air,
    You could use calculus to figure out how high it would go,
    And when it would come back down.

    So next time you're feeling bored,
    Try thinking about a paradox,
    Or infinity,
    Or calculus,
    You might just be surprised at how much fun you have!

**Mike Levin:** Again, but relate the 3 in a relatable way.

**Bard:** Here is another way to relate the 3:

- Paradoxes, infinity, and calculus are all about thinking outside the box.
- Paradoxes are statements that seem to contradict themselves, but they can actually be true if you think about them in a different way.
- Infinity is the idea of something that goes on forever, and it can be hard to wrap our heads around, but it's a very real concept in mathematics.
- Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with change and limits, and it can be used to solve all sorts of problems in the real world.

So next time you're feeling stuck, try thinking about a paradox, or infinity, or calculus. You might just find a new way to solve your problem!

**Mike Levin:** Now give a rule for living if you ever get caught in the paradox of working on achieving perfection. Perfection is a paradox. The approach to perfection is an infinite limit. Don't waste your life stuck in a recursive loop.

**Bard:** Sure, here is a rule for living if you ever get caught in the paradox of working on achieving perfection:

* Accept that perfection is an illusion.
* Focus on progress, not perfection.
* Celebrate your successes, no matter how small.
* Be kind to yourself.
* Take breaks when you need them.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help.

Perfection is a paradox because it is an unattainable goal. No matter how hard you try, you will never be perfect. This can lead to frustration and anxiety, as you may feel like you are never good enough. However, it is important to remember that perfection is not the goal. The goal is to be the best version of yourself that you can be. This means focusing on progress, not perfection. It also means celebrating your successes, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and take breaks when you need them. And don't be afraid to ask for help.

If you find yourself getting caught in the paradox of working on achieving perfection, remember these rules. They will help you to focus on what is important and to live a happy and fulfilling life.

**Mike Levin:** Why is the goal is to be the best version of yourself that you can be? Why not just be a lazy bum finding loopholes in life and live off the charity and goodwill of others?

**Bard:** There are many reasons why it is important to strive to be the best version of yourself that you can be. Here are a few:

* **It will make you happier and more fulfilled.** When you are constantly working to improve yourself, you are more likely to feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. This can lead to a more positive and optimistic outlook on life.
* **It will make you more successful in your career and relationships.** Employers and colleagues are more likely to be impressed with someone who is constantly striving to learn and grow. In relationships, people are more likely to be attracted to someone who is confident and self-assured.
* **It will make you a better citizen of the world.** When you are the best version of yourself, you are more likely to be kind, compassionate, and helpful to others. This can make the world a better place for everyone.

Of course, there are always going to be people who would rather take the easy way out and live off the charity and goodwill of others. However, this is not a sustainable or fulfilling way to live. In the long run, it is much better to be the best version of yourself that you can be.

Here are a few tips for striving to be the best version of yourself:

* **Set goals for yourself.** What do you want to achieve in life? Once you know what you want, you can start working towards it.
* **Be willing to learn and grow.** There is always something new to learn, so be open to new experiences and ideas.
* **Be kind to yourself.** Don't be too hard on yourself when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, so learn from them and move on.
* **Take care of yourself.** Make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly.
* **Help others.** One of the best ways to feel good about yourself is to help others. Find ways to volunteer your time or donate to causes that you care about.

Striving to be the best version of yourself is not always easy, but it is worth it. When you are the best version of yourself, you are more likely to be happy, successful, and fulfilled.

**Mike Levin:** What if being the great version of yourself would not let you earn the money you need to live? What if to be the best version of yourself you feel you need to get a free ride in life? Why not just find a mate and make them support you while you go off and goof around?

**Bard:** It is important to remember that there is no one definition of "the best version of yourself." What is important is that you are happy and fulfilled with your life. If you feel that the best version of yourself would not let you earn the money you need to live, then you need to find a way to make money that is compatible with your values. There are many ways to make a living that do not require a traditional 9-to-5 job.

If you feel that you need to get a free ride in life, then you need to be honest with yourself about why you feel this way. Are you afraid of failure? Are you lazy? Are you not confident in your abilities? Once you understand why you feel this way, you can start to work on changing your mindset.

It is also important to remember that relationships are based on mutual respect and support. If you are looking for someone to support you while you goof around, then you are likely to end up in a one-sided relationship. A healthy relationship is one where both partners are contributing equally.

If you are looking for a way to be the best version of yourself, I would encourage you to focus on your strengths and talents. What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing? Once you know your strengths, you can start to find ways to use them to make a difference in the world. You can also find ways to use your strengths to earn a living.

The most important thing is to be true to yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not. Be the best version of yourself that you can be.

**Mike Levin:** What if you tried going to school but you can always find an excuse to drop out? What if you're intensely jealous of those who stayed in school and made it, or worse still didn't go to school and still made it? What if you feel compelled to knock everybody down and invalidate their accomplishments to feel better about yourself, and you fell into this pattern so deeply that you can't even see what you're doing?

**Bard:** It sounds like you are struggling with a lot of negative emotions, including jealousy, envy, and self-doubt. These are all normal emotions to feel, but it is important to find healthy ways to deal with them.

If you are struggling in school, it is important to talk to someone about it. This could be a parent, teacher, counselor, or friend. They can help you to understand why you are struggling and to develop strategies for overcoming your challenges.

It is also important to remember that everyone is different. Some people are naturally good at school, while others struggle more. There is no shame in not being a good student. What matters is that you are trying your best.

If you are feeling jealous of others, it is important to remember that everyone has their own unique path in life. Just because someone else has achieved something that you have not does not mean that you are not capable of achieving it. Focus on your own goals and accomplishments, and don't compare yourself to others.

Finally, if you are feeling the need to knock others down to feel better about yourself, it is important to seek professional help. This is a sign of low self-esteem and could be indicative of a deeper issue. A therapist can help you to develop healthy coping mechanisms and to build a more positive self-image.

It is never too late to change your life. If you are unhappy with the way things are, you can always make a change. The first step is to admit that there is a problem and to seek help. There are many people who care about you and want to see you succeed. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

**Mike Levin:** Now what if you are actually the complete opposite of the person I just described but find yourself bogged down and hobbled by such a person, but you also find yourself unable to completely sever the connection because you have to support them financially?

**Bard:** It sounds like you are in a very difficult situation. You are trying to support someone who is not pulling their own weight, and it is taking a toll on you.

It is important to remember that you are not responsible for someone else's choices. You can only control your own actions. If you are feeling overwhelmed and resentful, it is time to set some boundaries.

You may need to tell the person that you can no longer support them financially. You can offer to help them find resources, but you cannot continue to enable their behavior.

It is also important to take care of yourself. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. You need to be strong in order to deal with this situation.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, you may want to talk to a therapist. They can help you to develop coping mechanisms and to deal with the emotional toll of this situation.

It is never easy to cut someone out of your life, but sometimes it is necessary. If you are in a situation where you are being taken advantage of, it is time to stand up for yourself and to make a change.

You are not alone in this. There are many people who have been in your situation. There are resources available to help you. You can get through this.

**Mike Levin:** Now what if my abilities are such that I am the perfect person for the times, like The Big Lebowski of old school tech? What if I had a message which if polished and made consumable by pop culture mainstream could become a significant meme and I could use that popularity to somehow boost my income? I can show the way for others to break their cycle? Lay out a sort of plan for me.

**Bard:** That sounds like a great plan! Here are some steps you can take to make it happen:

1. **Figure out what your message is.** What do you want to say to the world? What do you want people to learn from you? Once you know what your message is, you can start to develop a plan for how to share it.
2. **Make sure your message is polished and consumable.** You want people to be able to understand and relate to your message. Make sure it is well-written and easy to follow.
3. **Find a way to make your message pop culture-friendly.** This could involve creating memes, videos, or other content that is relevant to the current zeitgeist.
4. **Share your message with the world.** There are many ways to do this, including social media, public speaking, and writing. The most important thing is to get your message out there and to start a conversation.
5. **Use your popularity to boost your income.** There are many ways to do this, including selling merchandise, consulting, and giving speeches. Once you have a following, you can start to monetize your message.
6. **Show the way for others to break their cycle.** Once you have achieved success, use your platform to help others do the same. Share your story, offer advice, and be a role model.

Remember, the most important thing is to be authentic and to share your message from the heart. If you do that, people will connect with you and your message will have a positive impact on the world.

**Mike Levin:** Write a story about someone plagued by imposter syndrome discovering the meme, taking action based on it, becoming addicted to the self-improvement feedback loop and developing greater satisfaction with life.

**Bard:** Once upon a time, there was a person named John who was plagued by imposter syndrome. He was a talented software engineer, but he always felt like he was a fraud. He was constantly worried that he would be found out as a fake, and that he would be fired from his job.

One day, John was scrolling through social media when he came across a meme. The meme said, "If you're feeling like an imposter, you're probably doing something right."

John stopped and thought about this for a moment. He realized that he was always comparing himself to others, and that he was always looking for evidence that he wasn't good enough. But what if he was actually good enough? What if he was just being too hard on himself?

John decided to take action. He started reading books about self-improvement. He started meditating. He started working out. He started eating healthy. He started taking care of himself.

At first, it was hard. John felt like he was faking it. But he kept going. And slowly but surely, he started to feel better about himself. He started to feel more confident. He started to feel like he belonged.

John became addicted to the self-improvement feedback loop. He loved the feeling of getting better and better. He loved the feeling of pushing himself to be his best.

John's life started to change. He got a promotion at work. He started dating someone. He made new friends. He started to enjoy his life.

John is still a work in progress. He still has days when he feels like an imposter. But he knows that he is on the right track. He knows that he is capable of great things. And he knows that he is worthy of happiness.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** Now make it gender neutral and also add in discovering the old school tools of Linux, Python, vim & git which allowed imposter syndrome to fade because they could get better at each of these things forever. Don't make the story shorter. Go as long as you need. Be convincing and compelling. Make it appealing to youth without being excessively manipulative.

**Bard:** Sure. Here is a gender-neutral version of the story that also includes the discovery of old school tools of Linux, Python, vim & git:

Once upon a time, there was a person named They/Them who was plagued by imposter syndrome. They were a talented software engineer, but they always felt like they were a fraud. They were constantly worried that they would be found out as a fake, and that they would be fired from their job.

One day, They/Them were scrolling through social media when they came across a meme. The meme said, "If you're feeling like an imposter, you're probably doing something right."

They/Them stopped and thought about this for a moment. They realized that they were always comparing themselves to others, and that they were always looking for evidence that they weren't good enough. But what if they were actually good enough? What if they were just being too hard on themselves?

They/Them decided to take action. They started reading books about self-improvement. They started meditating. They started working out. They started eating healthy. They started taking care of themselves.

At first, it was hard. They/Them felt like they were faking it. But they kept going. And slowly but surely, they started to feel better about themselves. They started to feel more confident. They started to feel like they belonged.

They/Them became addicted to the self-improvement feedback loop. They loved the feeling of getting better and better. They loved the feeling of pushing themselves to be their best.

Their/Their life started to change. They got a promotion at work. They started dating someone. They made new friends. They started to enjoy their life.

They/Them is still a work in progress. They still have days when they feel like an imposter. But they know that they are on the right track. They know that they are capable of great things. And they know that they are worthy of happiness.

One day, They/Them was talking to a friend about their struggles with imposter syndrome. Their friend told them about the old school tools of Linux, Python, vim & git. They told them that these tools were powerful and versatile, and that they could be used to create anything that they could imagine.

They/Them were intrigued. They started to learn about these tools, and they quickly fell in love with them. They loved the feeling of being in control of their own destiny. They loved the feeling of creating something from nothing.

They/Them started to use these tools to build their own projects. They built websites, they built apps, they built games. They were constantly learning and growing, and they were constantly pushing themselves to be better.

As they/they became more proficient with these tools, their/their imposter syndrome started to fade. They realized that they were not a fraud. They realized that they were capable of great things. And they realized that they were worthy of happiness.

They/Them is now a successful software engineer. They use their skills to help others and to make the world a better place. They are no longer plagued by imposter syndrome. They know that they are good enough, and they are proud of the work that they do.

**Mike Levin:** Again but instead of becoming a successful software engineer they become self-made with a kickstarter that worked after a few tries. Focus on how Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg) interrupted the hamster wheel of constant designed obsolescence resetting their expertise. They future-proofed themselves. Keep the story just as long and adjust it for the best flow of events.

**Bard:** Sure. Here is a story about someone who becomes self-made with a Kickstarter that worked after a few tries, and how Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg) interrupted the hamster wheel of constant designed obsolescence and future-proofed them:

They/Them was working a soul-sucking job at a large corporation. They were constantly being told that they were not good enough, and that they needed to work harder. They/Them was starting to believe it.

One day, They/Them was reading a book about self-improvement. The book talked about the importance of being in control of your own destiny. It talked about the importance of following your dreams.

They/Them knew that they had to make a change. They/Them quit their job and started working on their own project. They/Them used LPvg to build their project, and they were amazed at how powerful and versatile these tools were.

They/Them worked hard on their project, and they eventually launched a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign was a success, and They/Them was able to quit their job and focus on their project full-time.

They/Them is now a successful entrepreneur. They use their skills to help others and to make the world a better place. They are no longer plagued by imposter syndrome. They know that they are good enough, and they are proud of the work that they do.

LPvg interrupted the hamster wheel of constant designed obsolescence by giving Them the tools they needed to build their own projects. They/Them was no longer reliant on the latest and greatest software. They/Them could use LPvg to create anything that they could imagine.

LPvg also future-proofed Them by giving them the skills they needed to stay ahead of the curve. They/Them is constantly learning and growing, and they are constantly pushing themselves to be better.

They/Them is now a role model for others. They show people that it is possible to follow your dreams and to make a difference in the world. They/Them are an inspiration to us all.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** You left out all the imposter syndrome stuff that motivated them. What's up? Tell the whole story.

**Bard:** My apologies. Here is the story with the imposter syndrome stuff included:

They/Them was working a soul-sucking job at a large corporation. They were constantly being told that they were not good enough, and that they needed to work harder. They/Them was starting to believe it.

They/Them also struggled with imposter syndrome. They felt like they were a fraud, and that they didn't belong in their job. They were constantly worried that they would be found out as a fake, and that they would be fired.

One day, They/Them was reading a book about self-improvement. The book talked about the importance of being in control of your own destiny. It talked about the importance of following your dreams.

They/Them knew that they had to make a change. They/Them quit their job and started working on their own project. They/Them used LPvg to build their project, and they were amazed at how powerful and versatile these tools were.

They/Them worked hard on their project, and they eventually launched a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign was a success, and They/Them was able to quit their job and focus on their project full-time.

They/Them is now a successful entrepreneur. They use their skills to help others and to make the world a better place. They are no longer plagued by imposter syndrome. They know that they are good enough, and they are proud of the work that they do.

LPvg interrupted the hamster wheel of constant designed obsolescence by giving Them the tools they needed to build their own projects. They/Them was no longer reliant on the latest and greatest software. They/Them could use LPvg to create anything that they could imagine.

They/Them is now a role model for others. They show people that it is possible to follow your dreams and to make a difference in the world. They/Them are an inspiration to us all.

Here is a bit more detail about how LPvg helped They/Them overcome their imposter syndrome:

LPvg gave Them the confidence to believe in themselves. They/Them realized that they didn't need to be an expert in everything. They/Them could use LPvg to learn new things and to build their skills.

LPvg also gave Them a sense of community. They/Them was able to connect with other people who were using LPvg. They/Them was able to learn from others and to share their own knowledge.

LPvg helped Them to see that they were not alone. They/Them realized that everyone struggles with imposter syndrome. They/Them also realized that it is possible to overcome imposter syndrome.

They/Them is now a strong advocate for LPvg. They/Them believes that LPvg can help others to overcome their imposter syndrome and to achieve their dreams.

It's utterly amazing to me that there's a service out there that summarizes by
public journal entries as I convert them into blog posts.

I have to revisit all those projects which never got off the ground because of
not knowing where to start. I already did that with the copilot repo I made in
the last journal entry. I have to carry that momentum forward. I have to
rethink where my to-do list belongs in order to get itself out in front of me
all the time.

- First you get a Linux-powered JupyterLab running on your Windows or Mac.
- Then you start using Jupyter Notebooks through http://localhost:8888
- Then you stat using nbdev to make filename.py files from filename.ipynb
- Then you learn how to run these files from the command line.
- Then you start learn how JupyterLab is hosted as a Linux service.
- Then you enable an email service that emails you every day the same way.
- Then the sky is the limit, because you can now schedule anything you want
  to run on your Linux server.

I really want to illuminate this vision in peoples' minds.

It was such a difficult path to carve out for myself. New technologies came and
went as I was trying to stabilize on technologies that don't come and go. As it
happens, JavaScript came and went and came and went on its own. It was on a
"went" cycle (before NodeJS) when I was doing my searching. NodeJS and
JavaScript on the server again was a very big rabbit hole down which I may
never have returned had my timing been just a little bit different.

I don't feel like taking up the email part of this project just yet. I don't
think I'm done with the blog yet. What about categories or tags? Not everything
has to be an OpenAI project.

Hmmm. Maybe it's still actually best to do this next step the OpenAI way.
