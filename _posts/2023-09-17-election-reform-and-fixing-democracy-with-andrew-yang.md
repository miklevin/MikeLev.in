I was drawn to this video because of the AI title, but I learned a lot about
election reform from Andrew Yang [Forward Party](https://www.forwardparty.com/)

election you have to win over 51% of voters. The system is broken because
incumbents only have to motivate the tiny percentage of voters who vote in the
primaries, and independents are locked out.
