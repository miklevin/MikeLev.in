title: "Hey AI: Give Me Credit, Consent & Compensation"
headline: "Making a Living Off Content: Leveraging Human Advantages, Licensing Content, and Emphasizing Human Relationships."
description: This text explores how to make a living off of producing content that people find interesting and valuable. I provide several strategies to make this happen, such as leveraging the unique advantages of humans, licensing content, and emphasizing the human relationship aspect. Additionally, I discuss how the age of Wonderland and Oz is upon us, and how the Wizard of Oz book series can teach us much. I'm setting up a server to capture ideas and thoughts, practice writing, and publish a blog with valuable information.

Well, it's time to attack on 2 fronts:

Produce the kind of content that actual human beings are very much going to
want to learn from that's somewhat in competition with the types of answers
people can get from AI. Focus on alternatives to AI and the unique advantages
still inherent in humans. Until AIs have actual robot bodies and gain autonomy
and providence, that's going to be quite a lot remaining for humans for awhile.

License the content (or don't license it) very explicitly. If an AI learns from
the content produced above, make it inherently obvious that it did so based on
the unique precise nature of the subject-matter. In other words, there's no way
the AI could have known such-and-such if it didn't learn it from this location.
That's going to be tough because deep learning systems appear to exhibit
intuition and initiative. None-the-less, if we go about creating our content
with this in mind, we are more likely to produce smoking-gun evidence when
content theft does occur.

I am clearly walking into the tornado on this one. Good. My daily journaling in
vim is the type of thing I have to share with people. Think! Maybe you make
this a daily routine. Get people addicted to a thing. Play up the human
relationship stuff. Reverberations of Fred Rodgers. Be a Fred Rodgers of tech,
where all the children are actually adults going through existential crisis
because of AI. We're going to have "superior" parent all our lives now, and
most of them are going to be corporate sponsored trying to make us sheep.

Problems are going to be solved and an accelerated rate. Processes are going to
become more efficient. Endeavors that would have taken decades to accomplish
will be compressed into years, if not months. The age of Wonderland and OZ is
definitely upon us. I should play up that aspect as well.

Mr. Rodgers accompanies you to Wonderland and OZ. The first and most important
thing is to know which is which. What world-view prevails in the arena you walk
into? What flavor of jealous greed and control does the rulership abide by, the
British monarch type or the American revolutionary type? It will make a lot of
difference with what you can do as Alice or Dorothy in those worlds.

In Alice's Wonderland the best you can hope for is not getting your head
chopped off. In Dorothy's Oz, you might become a respected and loved
co-princess of the land, welcome to invite your Uncle Henry and Aunt Em to come
live. What, you haven't read the books? Shame on you! Much about how AI is
going to play out can be gleaned from The Wizard of Oz original 14 book series.

The key question is do I think I'm going into the tornado enough to make living
expenses off of from Patreon, YouTube Membership and other sources? I think I
may turn the multiple revenue stream thing into part of my whole schtick,
playing into the new sidehustle culture, but with my own particular twist
because my mad skills are exactly what everyone trying to do sidehustle covet.
I mean just starting with being a vim person, but onto Linux, Python...

Yeah, no need to beat the dead horse. Actually there is. Most people don't get
it. The more you crystallize and clarify that vision in your head, the more
you're going to be able to effectively communicate it to different people in
different ways, from the elevator pitch to long-form essays and video.

Hmmm, this comes down to steady, even pressure publishing the very content that
will make me money. All content I publish now has to be geared towards:

- Building a critical mass of attractive content
- Leading them to where they're hungry for more enough to pay

Don't do anything during business hours publishing-wise until after the end of
the day tomorrow, which makes today perfect for cleaning up and getting
organized.

Show the world what you've got. Never not be writing. The system that lets you
keep writing and publishing is the next thing up. Currently I copy paste from
SimpleNote into vim when I'm not in front of my computer. But it should be
emailing a special email address that is always checking and capable of
appending onto this very journal.

Think through the project and carry it out as another one of your overtures to
the world. You need to always do at least one practice run if you want to avoid
editing video.

I'll have to chose an email address to use. If the email is used for nothing
else and checks for a particular sender, then I can use the subject as the
headline and the body of the email as the post. Markdown helps a lot here too.

It's like I've been practicing for projects like this for awhile and I just
have to bring the time, motivation, and schtick. We should all have at least
one server running 24x7 on our behalf. This world had been quite inaccessible
to the mortals amongst us because servers, ugh! But that all changed last
October when Microsoft backported WSLg to Windows 10.

Start writing. Writing is encoding thoughts. By going through a linguistic
encoder, you are forced to articulate your thoughts and actually know what you
think at a higher level of consciousness. Until you do that, there's nagging
uncertainties especially when it comes to articulating your thought quickly on
demand, either for communication or decision making. So journal writing helps
you think better, communicate better and make better decisions.

So there's a logical sort of flow developing. Help other people do for
themselves what you have done for yourself. Keep off the big media player home
server software. There's a role for that but plenty of people show and do that.
That's not what I'm about. I'm about a server that does things for you much
like ITTT (If This Than That) and Zapier do for you, but without a dependency
on them. Just use Python and whatever is apt or pip installable.

- A "Do My Bidding" Email-Checker (primarily for idea-capture)
- Keeping Journals in vim (for processing thoughts & some web publishing)
- Publishing one of the journals as a blog (skin in the game)

Figure out what it is that you deeply care about more than anything else and
fear losing, and imagine losing it to find motivation to spur you forward and
into action. It's not an easy thing.

There is a dichotomy out there. "Stories" are so important, but it seems that
there is little attention-span for long-form content anymore.

Let's focus on content that's of great value which comes from breaking
information or new things in the world that aren't part of common knowledge
yet. Not common knowledge, that's an important concept.

If you've been able to do as much as you've done distracted and with shitty
parenting and terrible guidance, imagine what you're going to be able to do now
focused, having a clue and with AI as my sort of common wisdom parenting.
Narcissists are going to be some who have the least to learn from AI because
they think they know it all. It's going to be a very humbling experience. But
for me, what I plan on doing is putting myself back into a child-like state
asking questions at infinitum and with an open mind regarding the answers and
modifying my behavior.
