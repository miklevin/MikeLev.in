title: "Learning Linux Lesson #2: RUN! Run it from CLI!"
headline: Embrace the Future of Computing with Linux - It's Easier Than Ever!
description: As someone who knows that Linux is the future, I'm here to tell you that learning it doesn't have to be intimidating. With the help of commands like ls, cd, and pwd, you can easily navigate the command-line interface. And with Windows 11, it's easier than ever to install Linux. So take my advice and join the future of computing!

Two legs good. Four legs baaad. The second lesson in learning Linux is to not
have panic attacks when you open those little black type-in boxes. And believe
me, no one will tell you this or teach you how to get over it but me. Suppress
the frustration. It's not nearly as bad a place as you think. It is a good
place. It is a love-worthy place. It is your (and everyone else's of substance)
future. Microsoft knows it. Apple knew it. And you should know it now too.

Nuke the place for morbid... uh, I mean from orbit, it's the only way to be
sure. Windows is was born bad... bad to the BIOS, but we're stuck with it, at
least for awhile. So in the meanwhile, RUN! I mean run commands from the
command-line interface, also colloquially known as the CLI, Terminal or Shell.
Any will do and all are equally confusing. Don't be confused. It's just the
same as Dorothy landing in Oz. Instead of B&W going color, color goes black...
but oh what a beautiful black with highlights in emerald green and turquoise
blue. Give it a try. Trust men, you'll love it. And you'll never go obsolete
again.

Linux is lots of little commands. Get started with ls, cd, and pwd (for "print
working directory") to move around directories. Most people are on Windows and
Windows 11 makes installing Linux historically easy. And so my message starts
at Windows 11. And you're already on a graphical desktop (Windows 11) so it's a
perfect time to understand they're all the same and you don't need yet another.
It's the black command-line window that's important. You have to RUN. So take
my advice and RUN. Make sure you're running with copies of things and that no
single instance is all that important.
