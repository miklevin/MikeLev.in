title: Google Analytics GA4 API Access Will Be My First Project for Pipulate
headline: "Exploring Google Analytics GA4 API with Pipulate: My First Project is GA4mageddon"
description: I'm excited to start my first project for Pipulate, which involves accessing the Google Analytics GA4 API. I'm taking a top-down and bottom-up approach to SEO, and I've named my repo GA4mageddon. I'm using the impending Google-induced panic about GA4 to create better examples and instructions for readers to entice them to click through to the blog post.

The tenants of Pipulate include, you will be running a 100% genuine generic
Linux server at home, first probably on your Windows laptop under WSL and not
long later on something or matters not else. Linux runs on almost anything.
Find something fully under your control that you can keep on 24x7 that can run
Linux with a network connection. Call it a server. It matters not of its a NAS
or a Raspberry Pi.

It's weird to have the Pipulate.com domain relaunched with something a little
bit interesting to look at. That logo really works. And I pulled the simple.css
cdn file down local so I could edit its media queries. I wanted to keep the
buttons outlined at smaller sizes.

I now have the Pipulate homepage in my list of files that I edit here in vim.
The :ls command reveals I'm up to editing 15 files at once. I may cut some
back, but I really like that I can do :b pip[tab] to jump to the Pipulate
homepage. I renamed it's index.md to pipulate.md so it didn't collide with my
main site homepage which I jump to with :b ind[tab]. If they collided, vim
would present a menu asking which file I'd like to edit. I want this to become
so part of muscle memory that the menu was annoying. I use Jekyll's ability to
set the permalink in the frontmatter to name the file pipulate.md but have it
be index.html (them homepage) on the actual site. Really, it's "/" more than
index.html, but you get the idea.

Okay, now that Pipulate.com exist again, it's time to do a top-down and
bottom-up pass on the field of SEO. Top-down is surveying your sites.

Oh how SEO is different than it used to be. Once upon a time, you could (and
should) look at your log files. Today, you probably only should, but because of
the multitude of appealing hosting options like Github Pages, you can't. The
trade-off is worth it, darn it! That's one of the first realities from
old-school SEO that I had to adapt to. While log-files were interesting, it
really is a "Google Game" for the time being, and looking at log files is less
important than looking at Google Analytics and Google Search Console.

My first thoughts were to make this new repo into ga for Google Analytics, or
to just spell it out as googleanalytics. But in the end I realized I wanted it
to not be specific enough to exclude Google Search Console. I went through the
same thought process for a GSC repo with folder-name possibilities from simply
gsc to the verbose googlesearchconsole. In the end, I settled on ganalytics. I
consider galytics but that's an existing product. Ganalytics seems a pretty
open word, not too much priors. But upon the thought-work that appears at the
top of this article, I've fixed on GA4mageddon.

There is plenty of good stuff to cover in this new rendition of Pipulate and
all the common stuff like crawlers and serp scrapers will come in time. But
what's really hot is GA4. There's an impending Google-induced panic about to
ripple through the world of online marketing. I can be the beneficiary of much
of that because the examples out there for GA4 API access, the Python client
libraries, instructions and how-to's are really terrible right now.
