title: Creating Linux VM Interoperable Layer Instructions for Windows & Mac
headline: Exploring a Unique Approach to Web Development with Linux VMs, nbdev, Vim, and systemd
description: I'm exploring an approach to web development and tech development that combines Linux VMs, nbdev, Vim, and systemd. This approach could give you more control over your environment and resources, but it also has a steep learning curve and potential risks. I'm also developing free and open source software based on Python that can run from Jupyter Notebooks and Linux system services. Check out my blog post to learn more about this approach and how to get started.

Of course, I‚Äôm happy to start over. What can I assist you with now?

How can I find out how many URLs on a domain that you are aware of? For example how many URLs are on https://mikelevin.in and how can I know if you become aware of more URLs later?

Hello, this is Bing. One way to find out how many URLs on a domain is to use a tool like **Website Links Count Checker**¬≥ which can show you the total number of internal and external links on a given web page. You can also use **ICANN Lookup**‚Å¥ to get more information about the domain name and its registration data.

To know if I become aware of more URLs later, you can use **Search Console**¬≤ which can show you the top linking sites to your website and how they change over time. You can also monitor your site's performance and traffic using Search Console.

I hope this helps. Do you have any other questions? üòä

How long does it take from a Bing Webaster Tools URL submit before you're aware of it?

The time it takes for me to be aware of a URL submitted through Bing Webmaster Tools may vary depending on several factors. According to some sources¬π¬≤¬≥, it can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days for me to crawl and index the submitted URLs. However, submitting URLs does not guarantee that they will be indexed as I use a variety of signals to determine which pages are relevant and useful‚Å¥.

To increase the chances of your URLs being indexed by me, you should make sure that your site follows the webmaster guidelines‚Å∂ and that you do not block my access with robots.txt‚Å∂. You can also monitor your site's performance and indexation status using Bing Webmaster Tools.

I hope this answers your question. Is there anything else I can do for you? üòä

Are you aware of pages that are not relevant and useful? What if a page is determined to me relevant and useful later in time? These things have to be realized by the public as useful before they have signals.

- I try to be aware of as many pages as possible, but I may not be able to index all of them due to various reasons. Some pages may be blocked by robots.txt, some may have low quality or duplicate content, some may have technical issues or errors, and some may have low popularity or authority.
- I constantly update my index based on new and updated pages that I discover through crawling and URL submissions. If a page becomes relevant and useful later in time, I may index it if I find enough signals to support its value. Some of the signals that I use include keywords, titles, headings, links, social media shares, user behavior and feedback.
- I understand that some pages may have potential value before they have signals from the public. That‚Äôs why I encourage webmasters to submit their URLs to me through Bing Webmaster Tools and follow the webmaster guidelines to optimize their sites for me and the users.

Does this make sense? Do you have any other questions? üòä

Aside from the ways you mentioned what other steps might a webmaster take in order to ensure their content has the best chance to be exposed to people in order to acquire the signals of usefulness in the first place? Do you see the chicken and egg problem?

Some other steps that a webmaster might take to increase their content‚Äôs exposure and acquire signals of usefulness are:

- Creating original, engaging and relevant content that provides value to the users and answers their queries or needs.
- Using descriptive and catchy titles, headings and meta tags that capture the attention of the users and summarize the main points of the content.
- Adding images, videos, infographics or other multimedia elements that enhance the visual appeal and readability of the content.
- Promoting the content through social media platforms, email newsletters, blogs or other channels that can reach the target audience and generate traffic and shares.
- Encouraging user feedback and interaction through comments, ratings, reviews or surveys that can provide insights into user satisfaction and preferences.

I do see the chicken and egg problem that some webmasters may face when trying to get their content indexed by me. However, I also believe that quality content will eventually find its way to me and the users if it follows the best practices and provides value. I am always looking for new and useful content to improve my search results and serve my users better.

I hope this helps. Do you have any more questions? üòä

Wht parts of the above process can be automated?

Some parts of the above process that can be automated are:

- Submitting URLs to me through Bing Webmaster Tools using the Submit URLs API or the URL submission feature.
- Generating descriptive and catchy titles, headings and meta tags using tools like Yoast SEO or Rank Math that can help optimize the content for me and the users.
- Adding images, videos, infographics or other multimedia elements using tools like Canva or Lumen5 that can help create attractive and engaging visuals for the content.
- Promoting the content through social media platforms, email newsletters, blogs or other channels using tools like Buffer or Mailchimp that can help schedule and distribute the content to the target audience.
- However, some parts of the process may require human input and creativity, such as:
- Creating original, engaging and relevant content that provides value to the users and answers their queries or needs.
- Encouraging user feedback and interaction through comments, ratings, reviews or surveys that can provide insights into user satisfaction and preferences.

I hope this answers your question. Is there anything else I can do for you? üòä

I want to develop free and open source software based on Python running both from Jupyter Notebooks and Linux system services to achieve much of this automation.  How do you recommend I start? I will have a heavy emphasis on Linux, Python, vim & git and not using the cloud much mit instead leveraging local resources using VM Linux as an interoperable layer for all host machines.

That sounds like an interesting and ambitious project. To start developing free and open source software based on Python, you may want to follow these steps:

- Choose a small and manageable project idea that can be implemented as a library, a framework, a utility or a full application¬π.
- Install Python on your system. If you are using Linux or macOS, you may already have Python installed. If you are using Windows, you can download Python from the official website or use the Microsoft Store¬≤¬≥.
- Choose an IDE or a text editor that suits your needs and preferences. Some popular options for Python development are PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Vim and Jupyter Notebooks‚Å¥.
- Learn the basics of Python syntax, data structures, control flow and functions. You can use online tutorials, books or courses to help you with this‚Å¥.
- Write your code following the best practices and conventions of Python programming. You can use tools like pylint or flake8 to check your code quality and style¬π.
- Use git to manage your code versioning and collaboration. You can create a repository on GitHub or GitLab and push your code there¬π.
- Document your code using docstrings, comments and README files. You can also use tools like Sphinx or MkDocs to generate documentation from your code¬π.
- Test your code using unit tests, integration tests and functional tests. You can use tools like unittest, pytest or nose to write and run tests for your code¬π.
- Distribute your code using packaging tools like setuptools or pipenv. You can also upload your package to PyPI or Anaconda Cloud for others to install it easily¬π.

I hope this gives you some guidance on how to start developing free and open source software based on Python. Do you have any other questions? üòä

I plan in using nbdev 2 to keep parallel versions of each app: one in a Jupyter Notebook and one as a .py file referred to by a systemd .service file. I'll use WSL2 with Ubuntu Linux to serve Jupyter and on Macs I'll use MutiPass to run Ububtu. both will allow Jupyter to be served through the native OS browser. Please revise your how to get started instructions accordingly.

I see. In that case, you may want to revise some of the steps as follows:

- Install Python on your system using WSL2 or Multipass depending on your OS. You can follow the instructions from the official websites of these tools to set up Python on your virtual machine .
- Choose an IDE or a text editor that supports nbdev 2 and Jupyter Notebooks. Some popular options are Visual Studio Code, PyCharm and Vim .
- Write your code using nbdev 2 to keep parallel versions of each app: one in a Jupyter Notebook and one as a .py file. You can use the nbdev 2 documentation to learn how to use this tool for your development.
- Use systemd to create and manage .service files for your apps. You can use the systemd documentation to learn how to write and run .service files on Linux.
- Serve Jupyter through the native OS browser using WSL2 or Multipass. You can use the instructions from these tools‚Äô websites to learn how to access Jupyter from your browser .

The rest of the steps remain the same as before.

I hope this helps you get started with your project. Do you have any other questions? üòä

I'll be using vim exclusively for the text editor. This will be an opportunity to introduce most people to vim. I will also have a script for Windows and a different script for Macs that will install and run their respective Linux VMs plus install Jupyter and deal with the confirmation issues so it is accessible in tbe browser. People will be able to fast track getting to the aforementioned running app. It will already be running as a Linux system service after the install, but for the need to provide some config details by running a particular Notebook. Please revise the instructions accordingly.

I understand. In that case, you may want to revise some of the steps as follows:

- Install Python on your system using a script for Windows or Macs that will install and run their respective Linux VMs using WSL2 or Multipass. You can use the script to also install Jupyter and deal with the confirmation issues so it is accessible in the browser.

Re wrote this knowing that the Linux install scripts are called drinkme.bat for Windows and drinkme.sh for Mac. Don't send them to the documentation for each product but rather encourage them to follow along on the Pipulate.com site and watch the accompanying YouTube videos. Assure them of the safety and baby-step aspect of this approach.

use these scripts to" to "These scripts will..." Instead of "Use nbdev 2 to" use "Nbdev 2 will be used to..." And likewise re-write Use systemd to systemd will be used. Things get set up to already be running by the install scripts except for the configuration. This is important. The user is not being asked to do that much. We don't want to scare or intimidate them with tech stuff they're going to have to do.

Re-write but make it inclusive. Bo "rest of steps". I want a single place to copy the response from. You did great, Bing!

Thank you for your kind words. Here is the revised version of the steps:

- Install Python on your system using drinkme.bat for Windows or drinkme.sh for Macs that will install and run their respective Linux VMs using WSL2 or Multipass. These scripts will also install Jupyter and deal with the confirmation issues so it is accessible in the browser. These scripts are safe and easy to use and will guide you through the installation process step by step.

- Run a particular Notebook that will set up your app and make it ready to run as a Linux system service.

That‚Äôs all you need to do to get started with your project. Do you have any other questions? üòä

Now restate in your own words what I'm trying to do. Give me any advice about things you think I might be missing.

As far as I understand, you are trying to create a project that will use Pipulate, a free and open source SEO software that can help you optimize your website and rank higher on search engines. You are using a combination of tools and scripts that will make it easy for you to set up and run your project on any operating system using Linux VMs. You are also using Vim as your text editor and nbdev 2 as your development tool to keep your code organized and synchronized. You are using systemd to manage your apps as Linux system services and serve Jupyter through the native OS browser.

Some advice that I can give you based on my knowledge are:

- Make sure you have enough disk space and memory on your system to run the Linux VMs smoothly.
- Backup your code regularly in case something goes wrong with the VMs or the .service files.
- Test your app on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and functionality.
- Monitor your app‚Äôs performance and resource usage using tools like htop or top.
- Keep track of the latest updates and changes in Pipulate, nbdev 2, systemd, WSL2, Multipass, Vim and Jupyter.

I hope this helps you understand your project better. Do you have any other questions? üòä

How is this approach different from most other approaches to web development and tech development in general? Include Cloud, native installs (vs a Linux interoperable layer) and nbdev 2 to promote Jupyter Notebooks to first class dev tools. Write as much as you can. Use this 15th of 15 interactions to wonderful effect.

This approach is different from most other approaches to web development and tech development in general in several ways:

- It uses Linux VMs instead of native installs or cloud services. This means that you can run your project on any operating system without worrying about compatibility issues or dependencies. You also have more control over your environment and resources than using a cloud service that may have limitations or costs¬≤.
- It uses nbdev 2 to promote Jupyter Notebooks to first class dev tools. This means that you can write code and documentation in the same place, test your code interactively, and sync your code with a .py file automatically. You also have access to rich features like widgets, charts, graphs, and tables that can enhance your web development¬≥.
- It uses Vim as your text editor instead of a more graphical or user-friendly editor. This means that you can edit your code faster and more efficiently using keyboard shortcuts and commands. You also have access to a powerful plugin system that can extend Vim's functionality for web development‚Å¥.
- It uses systemd to manage your apps as Linux system services instead of using other tools or frameworks. This means that you can start, stop, restart, enable, disable, and monitor your apps easily using simple commands. You also have access to features like logging, security, dependencies, and resource management that can improve your app's performance and reliability‚Å¥.

This approach may have some advantages over other approaches depending on your goals and preferences. However, it may also have some drawbacks such as:

- A steep learning curve for some of the tools and concepts involved
- A lack of support or documentation for some of the tools or scripts used
- A potential risk of losing data or functionality if something goes wrong with the VMs or the .service files

Therefore, you should weigh the pros and cons of this approach before deciding if it suits your needs.

I hope this helps you compare this approach with other approaches to web development and tech development in general. Do you have any other questions? üòä
