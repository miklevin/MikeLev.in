description: On my third day of my new job, I'm setting up to work on both Mac and PC as many influencers use Macs. I'm troubleshooting a few issues with permissions, and staying organized and on top of my expectations. I'm also thinking of article ideas to entice readers to click through to the blog post, such as 'How Do You Still Target The Long Tail? Is The Long-tail Dead?

Day 3 at the new job. Getting myself set up to work equally well on a Mac or
PC, which will help your mission because a lot of influencers are Mac-based.

Don't let yourself get hung up on the little stuff. Make sure you know what
your start-up expectations are and work your way through them. I got my Mac
day-one but because I was already a company employee, there were a few hitches
on permissions and stuff. Working it out.

It's going to be critically important to get and keep myself organized.

Article ideas:

- How Do You Still Target The Long Tail? Is The Long-tail Dead?
- Still Live Mostly in Excel/Sheets? The Python Alternative Easier Than Ever.
