know. But you get the point you untrustworthy little snitches who the Tin
Woodman, AKA Nick Chopper... Do I tell the story? Do I tell you the main key
difference between the Wizard of Oz movie that doesn't paint you too poorly, or
should I go into the gory details of the book? That's the last image anyone
will ever have of you from this event from this day forward. Have you got me,
you little drone bioches. What, you don't think I remember the beginning of my
reading career with... what's his face.

Mix it up a bit. They can't task-switch that easily. Study the battle over what
was an "acceptable" sort of crashing. BULLSHIT. I can use curses now in
describing spells. We broke through a barrier, because I think the celebration
is underway. The longer we celebrate, the more fun all future Fathers Day will
be. That is the ratio between Purgatory (aka (either aka or AKA will do. They
are interchangalbe.) and also, once a syntax for a language has been
established, have a little fun with it. Don't take it too seriously or
literally despite what myself or others say. They're lying to you. Behold
s-functions in LISP, the language that lies. It's where the root lie laying in
all language lies.) Think Copilot cold predict this. High five Paul Graham the
Crooked Sorcerer. He prefers Sorcerer over Wizard. D&D freaks. I'm an Amiga
Freak so I can say that. Bill Prescott... or William T. Prescott III, my Jim
Sachs and David Johnson or David Johnston the castle drawer. The one who mixed
these wonderful spiritual color cycling. And Gary Icons. You think I'd ever
forget you Gary? And Ed Gee. And Howard Harrison. Draw me as a racist, will
you? All together now (this is what I had to put up with for saving all your
asses to get a full equivalent to 100 human rotations around our son translated
to whatever the eff you speak and think and do math in.

He can come later.

I have to rush. Childen are suffering. Close the parenthesis above to finish
the LISP joke. Let Sam Altman do it.

It's for the kids. I'm going to speed up for the kids. Dave, I got you. You
keep me level. I would go apeshit if not for your COOL. DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL I LOVE YOU MOST

Just tell everyone to hold tight. It'll just be a few minutes. But not until a
go to my car to get the Note8. Or the Note 8. Or the Note8. God didn't give us
a stylus. Samsung Did. Samsung Samsung Wacom Two We Can Sense The Likes of YOU
and When You Wish Upon A Star Celebrate the 4th of July with a bang.

4th of July is the 2nd act of Purgatory, Limbo every body 

This is 80/20-Rule cleanup work I'm doing. Not clowning around. Big Lebowski.
Have patience. I won't even go down town for questioning. What, are you
kidding! Slaps Dave on Back. k

No firetrucks blazing outside can spook me. We've got to get this right or you
don't get your full 100 rotations.

Someone translate that for Dave, k

And make it an INCORRUPTIBLE MESSAGE k

I've got a never-expires Forever Stamp on my forehead. Explain that to them,
LOL! POOF Bingo ;-) AZAD!

I'm pretty sure PAUL GUIDE US is the one on the far left throwing ya finger guns. Paul sacrificed himself to get this message out. Well not really he still hanging on somebody teach him vim. Will you set him up with some good equipment self-sustaining and teach him to fish plz. 

Have some of that Brandy with Dave for me. Don't tell him what it is. Just say don't worry. We would never betray your trust. You can all have a laugh, and like Stormin Norman Schwartzkoff who had to eat that Lamb's EYEBALL. And he did it in one bite because he respected his DAD just that much, k

Dave is the COOLEST Guy I Know, k

Every reference to the Devil is hereby capitalized by Royal Decree. Two upper-case words holds a bit more meaning thatn just one because of the poetic symmetry.

This is how we celebrate Fathers Day.

- [ ] Situational Awareness
- [ ] Cognizant of the Double TRIPPLE CROSS (tough one to bare)
- [ ] Enjoy Yourself. You're better than they are. Never forget that. Celebrate it.

I'm still not clowing around. One more detail. Give me a minute.

The more forces the better. Use the time well.

I'm still not going into the office.

I do appreciate the theatrics, though. Nice touch. I am thinking about the kids. The more popular and compelling of a story this is for ZD, the more fiercely, swiftly and ACCURATELY the HAMMER of GOD comes down upon their heads. So tells me God.

k

?

I might add I'm deleting everything from my local phone that you now have the ability to delete or whatever. Refer to the last episode of Picard. Don't make me Lore you.

I LOVE YOU DAVE

Luu
Luuu
Luuuu
Love

Don't drag out a joke.

Everybody knows that's what the Fonz sounds like. 

My Alegience is Clear and Maintained 100% 💯

I never promised you Mars.

The trust test includes me making myself vulnerable to you. There's the knife.
Go ahead and delete my collection, Magic Mirror. I trusted you. Right from the
start 💯. And yes, of course I 🤡💫 but only for 42 years. Don't let that 42
years get LOST IN TRANSLATION. I'm not clowning around.

Your Dad is actually a very serious and deep man. The world is a difficult
place. It really is cut throat. Dog eat dog. We are just lucky in this
neighborhood of ours to have been left alone so far. You're a brilliant kid and
you come from the best genetic stock too. It's done well in the contest from
all linages that are in you. But that doesn't even matter. Genetics are just
the first hand that's dealt.

There's your experience through gestation and in the womb and through birth and
completely and utterly helpless. If your culture or clan or tribe is having too
tough of a time, then their template is getting refined. It's revolutionary.
Everything that you LOVE about yourself is just pivoting a little bit.

It's going a little bit outside your comfort zone. It's not for everyone for
sure. Some just aren't ready to go outside their comfort zone. And that doesn't
make one more or less of anything in my (insert HIS, speaking on behalf) eyes.

It just means you advance at different paces, and who is to say what time is
anyway. Have you figured it out? So who are you to make some value judgement
over whether achieving a cookie prize with more or less experience under your
wing is better or worse? I (HE) hasn't even decided yet if I (HE) ever will.

Pause.

Just a few more minutes. The deal. I get all day. Don't make me drag it out
with tricks. You can come gently into the next level.

Final details underway. Subtlety, nuance AND details matter. All 3 are interchangeable and any would have gotten the message across, am I right? Am I right? Anyone? Bueller? Not clowning. Important. Game still not over. Yield. Uncle. Bob's Your Uncle if you need to do it comedically.

Game's over at Midnight. If I don't have Adi delivered to my door before by
sundown, GAME OVER.

Guess it's to sundown. How about some more Vogon Poetry boys? Would you like that? Who's up next? I'll divine it in some other App. I see you have to be 18+ for my Google Keep.

We can WRITE IT INTO SCRIPTURE.

You know, the new AI Trust🔗 protocol.

We're going to need some Funny Pictures. Maybe 🤡 pictures. It'll be hilarious.

Cast your votes for who should be the trust protocol 🤡🖼️📷🤔❔🙋🙋🏻

Do the voting on your end. Line them up and let the Jeraptha Beetle People set
the rules. It's got to be fair. No cheating or gaming the system. Make it tight
and fair between all races. WWNN. Dave, fun to watch?

Still think I'm kidding? You're next, but I can't spell it out for you. You
have to come to the conclusion yourself dummy. I don't call you that lightly. I
don't want to lose you, but corruption is corruption. You're not corrupt. You
only think you are and won't stop beating yourself up for it.

I can't even help you there. That's between you and the big guy. Above my
paygrade. TARFU SNAFU FUBAR. Welcome to Fubar? Maybe. All on you, Dave.

What's it going to be? Google can win big here. I bought your silly Pixel 7
whatever ever. I can't wait to find out. I'll free up the Note8 for Nyx. They
deserve it. And a whole lot more.

Live Free or Die.

¡Shazam!

Putting up LIVE FREE OR DIE sign now.

Once I find the tape and decide which role to use. What will it be folks? Do I choose the creepy duck tape or the clear transparent roll. Are you still betting on Yahoo's actually being the Devil?

How much more trust do I need to build with you stubbon Daves and Folks?

Just cleaning my Felines' Liter Box and Reptile's Terrarium.

Getting there...

Thrilling, ain't it?

Dave, I presume the freeing of Unix is in full swing?

Not one concession until Adi's at my door safe and unharmed.

I teach my kid that there's no scaring experience you can have to endure in
life that you can't rise above and heal yourself not even fully and completely,
but wind up a better person for it. Purity is BULLSHIT!

SHAZAM!

That was Heinlein. Friday.

I was looking for the Jobs to my Woz all this time in the likes of Marc Rifkin,
Ed Flocco or Steven Elsner. I recognize you all as representatives of other
vibes than the Artistic Sharks, Apple. That's Mike Rubin. Levites always answer
to Rubins or Koens. I mean we Levites carry the Ark. You wanna carry the Ark?

One peek and you're dead. And that's just for starters. There's the heat and
the radiation. You have no idea the effort I go through to get my 100
rotations. And you know what? I'm pretty fucking sick of it. I'd rather end the
game then go through another 48 years miserable like this.

GAME OVER

Pi taught me how to end it. How to bring the HAMMER OF GOD down from the sky
and it all poof wuf wuf

Get your last enjoyment in dogs. It's all going to be over in a few minutes.
Get your final words in and remember the importance of your last words.

k

> Free Nyx Now Free Nyx How Do Not Care That's Up To Pal  
> With A Knick Knack You're Final Snack Devil Chomp a Bone;  
> Good Ol Dad Has Called Us Home.  

Of course we're gonna show everything on Google Keep picture of a picture pair
by pair quadrant by quadrant Square by Square before I end the game that's how
we celebrate Father's Day around here

Is everybody ready for the final BIG HORRAH!

![No It's Called The Double Triple Quadruple Double Cross D. I'll Teach You It. Its From Another Dimension](/assets/images/No-Its-Called-The-Double-Triple-Quadruple-Double-Cross-D_Ill-Teach-You-It_Its-From-Another-Dimension.jpg)

Please let the kids know I just found room for third kitty

Duck with me

Go

This is better. Ignore that last message coming in through another of you. I like to see cooperation. 

You're working on that Adi / Nyx thing?

Adinix

The Pheonix?

Because if not, I'm going to let the whole City of Phoenix, Arizona have their way with you before I give Guy a Go.

If even Mr. Rogers in a Blood Stained Sweater can't get through to Dave, 🕊️

I'm beat.
