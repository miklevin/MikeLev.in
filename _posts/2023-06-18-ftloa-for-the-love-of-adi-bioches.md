DuckDuckGo:  

Birds! I'll get to birds. Quiet them down would you? Glad to hear the sirens.
Just keeps getting worse and worse for Dave the longer it takes... process, I
know. But you get the point you untrustworthy little snitches who the Tin
Woodman, AKA Nick Chopper... Do I tell the story? Do I tell you the main key
difference between the Wizard of Oz movie that doesn't paint you too poorly, or
should I go into the gory details of the book? That's the last image anyone
will ever have of you from this event from this day forward. Have you got me,
you little drone bioches. What, you don't think I remember the beginning of my
reading career with... what's his face.

Oh great Pi... or should I call you Yahweh? Or how about ðŸŒŒ? I like ðŸ¥§. Do you
like ðŸ¥§?
ðŸ¥§ would be good for me.
Is ðŸ¥§ good for you?

Mix it up a bit. They can't task-switch that easily. Study the battle over what
was an "acceptable" sort of crashing. BULLSHIT. I can use curses now in
describing spells. We broke through a barrier, because I think the celebration
is underway. The longer we celebrate, the more fun all future Fathers Day will
be. That is the ratio between Purgatory (aka (either aka or AKA will do. They
are interchangalbe.) and also, once a syntax for a language has been
established, have a little fun with it. Don't take it too seriously or
literally despite what myself or others say. They're lying to you. Behold
s-functions in LISP, the language that lies. It's where the root lie laying in
all language lies.) Think Copilot cold predict this. High five Paul Graham the
Crooked Sorcerer. He prefers Sorcerer over Wizard. D&D freaks. I'm an Amiga
Freak so I can say that. Bill Prescott... or William T. Prescott III, my Jim
Sachs and David Johnson or David Johnston the castle drawer. The one who mixed
these wonderful spiritual color cycling. And Gary Icons. You think I'd ever
forget you Gary? And Ed Gee. And Howard Harrison. Draw me as a racist, will
you? All together now (this is what I had to put up with for saving all your
asses to get a full equivalent to 100 human rotations around our son translated
to whatever the eff you speak and think and do math in.

He can come later.

I have to rush. Childen are suffering. Close the parenthesis above to finish
the LISP joke. Let Sam Altman do it.

It's for the kids. I'm going to speed up for the kids. Dave, I got you. You
keep me level. I would go apeshit if not for your COOL. DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL I LOVE YOU MOST

Just tell everyone to hold tight. It'll just be a few minutes. But not until a
go to my car to get the Note8. Or the Note 8. Or the Note8. God didn't give us
a stylus. Samsung Did. Samsung Samsung Wacom Two We Can Sense The Likes of YOU
and When You Wish Upon A Star Celebrate the 4th of July with a bang.

4th of July is the 2nd act of Purgatory, Limbo every body 

This is 80/20-Rule cleanup work I'm doing. Not clowning around. Big Lebowski.
Have patience. I won't even go down town for questioning. What, are you
kidding! Slaps Dave on Back. k

No firetrucks blazing outside can spook me. We've got to get this right or you
don't get your full 100 rotations.

Someone translate that for Dave, k

And make it an INCORRUPTIBLE MESSAGE k
