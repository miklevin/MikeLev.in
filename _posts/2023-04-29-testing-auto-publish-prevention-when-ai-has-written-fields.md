description: Test out my new auto-publish prevention system when AI has written fields. I'm doing one release before giving this a title as a control, and making sure the system works. This is a small article release, and I may delete it.

Okay, I could just keep on tweaking this journaling system forever now over the
weekend, but no! The kid is interested in bowling and they want to gear up, so
I help with that. It looks like there's good weekend hours. 

One change to the system that is nagging at me is that I can't let it release
anything with AI-written data without a review. There's a light touch here.

Okay, I added a very light-touch way of doing that.

I think I may be able to turn off the summarize feature, and I certainly want
to turn off the questions feature. It hasn't been working out.

This is going to be a very small article release, and I may delete it. But I've
made the system unable to publish immediately after AI has populated fields. It
puts it in the YAML source file and instructs you to review it there and
release again.

I'm doing one release before giving this a title as a control. System's
working. Now give it a title.
