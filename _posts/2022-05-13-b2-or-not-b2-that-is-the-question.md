:b2 or not :b2, that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to
publish and share with you the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune here on
MikeLev.in, or to keep all my thoughts private and proprietary, secrets between
only me and my Jedi trainer, Oh :b1. Oh! No, this post is about SEO. So, it's
:b5 to stay alive!

Hmmm, I am forever more tempted to just think out loud about my latest right
here in the public eye. And my latest is that things are clicking in my head
for the first time in a long, long time. Sometimes you just gotta say eff-it
and do those things you know are right for the reasons you know are right.

Okay, so eff-it. Let's ideate in front of y'all and show you what it is to be
novel, unique and uncompressible.

One of those novel and unique things I do is a method of web-publishing via my
old principles but with the benefits of the new ways. My old system was, is and
probably forever will be thought of as slicing & dicing, or just slice & dice.
I've already got:

    pip install blogslicer --upgrade

...in PyPI.org already. See, it was just so friggin' easy once I decided to try
implementing it again. Implementation of such things is almost just becoming a
transparent aspect of muscle memory now. Re-implementing something that took me
months in the past is now just like taking a deep breath and warming up to get
to the first roughed-out, but fully working and having an impact on the world,
first implementation.

There are new ways. I just shot from the hip using the new ways to flesh out a
first pass, but it doesn't stop there.

The new ways have many benefits. Much of the technical liability in particular
is dispensed with. The greatest example of late has been Github Pages, which is
the Jekyll static site generator to do away with the tech liability overhead of
things like WordPress.

Okay, so this right here, MikeLevinSEO.com and MikeLev.in, are probably my
biggest overture to the world right now, right along with mlseo, my free and
open source software (FOSS) for search engine optimization (SEO).

    pip install mlseo --upgrade

I've got to blend everything seamlessly together, make astoundingly novel and
effective sites with them, and make it a very meta process. Think through the
purpose of each site again.

Yeah, soooo...

- Pipulate.com
- MikeLevinSEO.com
- pip install blogslicer
- pip install mlseo
- pip install pipulate

But blogslicer and mlseo should both be dependencies of Pipulate.

Pipulate has a lot of stars in Github, but very few people will actually be
using it in its old form. It's soooo old, and Google API-stuff has changed so
much.

Be like a bull in a china shop, even though that expression has been
discredited. Bulls are actually very careful in china shops, LOL. Either way,
the point stands. Go in there and gut Pipulate as much as you need to clear the
way to this very important project.

Do it now.
