My actual personal journal being on vim :b2 is really a change. My
muscle-memory can feel it. But I'm doing enough videos where I'm starting with
loading the journal with my "all" command, it makes for the best experience if
it drops right into the Wonderland Rabbit. You can always switch to :b2 to do
some personal journaling, starting out as if just for yourself as the only
audience, but then change your mind and "extract" a new public journal entry by
copy/pasting between the two journals.

BAM! Public entry. Next step? Do something that would be useful to almost all
SEOs. Make something that has clear viral value. Portable switch army SEO
product because anything can host LXD images, even Windows 10. If on Windows 11
then the graphics works without the extra X-server trick you have to do on
Windows 10. Why not just make a video out of it right now? Why not just make it
your switch from pyppeteer to playwright and your testing steps along the way.
Why not mention GPU-utilization, CUDA and alternatives?

But then go do a JupyterLab demo. All roads lead to VSCode. Learning Web
Browser automation in yet another road to VSCode. Beware. I'm taking you down
the JupyterLab Server (on Linux) route.
