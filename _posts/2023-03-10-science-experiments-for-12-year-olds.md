headline: Explore Cool Science Toys for 12 Year Olds with Bing!
description: Bing helped me find experiments for a 12 year old to conduct. I'm making an exhaustive list of kid's science toys that are cool and demonstrate a science principle, such as the Levitron, electronic building block set, stretchy thinking putty and more. Bing suggested a few more cool science toys for a 12 year old, including a kids' first chemistry set, a bubble science kit and a Root RT1 iRobot coding robot.

Which of these experiments is best for a 12 year old to conduct: - Two-slit experiment - Cloud chamber - Brownian motion - Mendel's pea plant experiment - Extract DNA - Boyle's air pump - Baking soda and vinegar reaction - Meissner effect - Black snake - Time crystal

Hello, this is Bing. I'm happy to help you find some experiments for a 12 year old to conduct.üòä

Based on my web search, some of the experiments you listed are more suitable for older students or require special equipment or materials that may not be easily available at home¬≤. For example, the two-slit experiment requires a laser pointer and a thin slit¬≤, the cloud chamber requires dry ice and alcohol¬≤, and the Meissner effect requires a superconductor and liquid nitrogen¬≤.

Some of the experiments you listed are more appropriate for younger children or are very common and may not be very challenging or interesting for a 12 year old. For example, the baking soda and vinegar reaction is a classic experiment that many kids have done before‚Å¥, and extracting DNA from strawberries can be done by kids as young as 5‚Åµ.

Some of the experiments you listed are very advanced or controversial and may not be feasible or ethical to conduct at home. For example, Mendel's pea plant experiment involves cross-breeding plants over several generations¬≤, which takes a lot of time and space. The time crystal experiment involves creating a new state of matter that breaks time symmetry¬≤, which is still debated by physicists.

The only experiment you listed that seems suitable for a 12 year old is the Brownian motion experiment, which involves observing how tiny particles move randomly in water due to collisions with molecules¬≤. This can be done with a microscope, some water, and some pollen grains or other fine dust.

However, there are many other experiments that you can try with your 12 year old that are fun, easy, and educational. Here are some examples from my web search:

- Explore static electricity with balloons, bending water, and electrifying gelatin ¬≥.
- Make your own electric toothbrush using a battery-operated motor ¬≥.
- Make your own (temporary) lava lamp using water, oil, food coloring, and antacid tablets ‚Å¥.
- Model a rainstorm in a glass using water, shaving cream, food coloring ‚Åµ.
- Make your own snow fluff using shaving cream and cornstarch ‚Åµ.

I hope this helps you find some exciting experiments for your 12 year old. What kind of science topics are they interested in?

These are great. I want to make an exhaustive list of kid's science toys. Let's get started.

I want it to be according to coolness and its ability to really demonstrate a science principle. Levitron tops that levitate would be one of the coolest examples. Iron filings in a sealed oil frame to use with magnets is very cool.

I see. So you want to rank the science toys by how cool they are and how well they demonstrate a science principle. That sounds like a fun and challenging task.üòä

Levitron tops are indeed very cool. They are spinning tops that can levitate in mid-air using magnetic forces‚Åµ. They come in different types and sizes, such as ceramic tops and rare-earth tops¬π. They demonstrate the principle of spin-stabilized magnetic levitation, which requires a delicate balance of gravity, magnetism, and angular momentum¬≤‚Åµ.

So list other science toys that are as cool as the Levitron. I want to make a really cool science lab for my 12 year old.

That sounds like a wonderful idea.üòä A cool science lab for your 12 year old would be a great way to inspire them to learn more about science and have fun at the same time.

Some other science toys that are as cool as the Levitron are:

- A snap-together electronic building block set that allows your child to experiment with various circuits filled with colorful lights as they learn the basics of electronics¬π¬≤.
- A stretchy thinking putty that teaches about polymers and changes color with temperature or light¬≥.
- A medical kit that is perfect for future doctors and lets them explore human anatomy and physiology¬≥.
- A crystal geode kit that lets them grow their own sparkling crystals and learn about geology¬≥.
- An electricity and magnetism kit that demonstrates various phenomena such as electromagnetism, electric motors, generators, and more‚Å¥.
