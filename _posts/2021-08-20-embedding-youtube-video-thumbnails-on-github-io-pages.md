Hello World! I'm streaming again. This time, back in my main journal. I'll try
to stay pure about an advancing story in Mike At Eleven. Honestly, that site is
to reach out to my daughter and to start the steady slow build on YouTube that
I know I can accomplish as sort of a side-gig without hardly trying. I know
that because I'm at about 10K viewers without really trying. And now by having
some discipline about daily publishing and processing my ideas, I'll be
releasing a lot of built-up potential. Anyhoo, there's a few refinements I
couldn't wait until tonight at 11 to do. Namely, YouTube video trimming because
now they have an editor, and this streaming stuff is new to me, so I'm showing
OBS and the YouTube "start streaming" screen more than I want at the beginning
and end of videos...

Ugh! I can't get to the Editor button like that video says is supposed to be
there. I may have to do that immediately after livestreaming, or perhaps a few
hours past after YouTube is done all its backend processing on different
resolutions or such. Anyway, I'll got to the next quick edit I want to do,
which is to embed the respective YouTube videos on each journal entry. I
experimented with that on my tictacufosightings site...

Okay, I have today's to do too...

You'll see me get better at my vim skills too as I have to do certain tasks
more often. Copy and paste with outside software (OS copy/paste buffers) is
often a challenge with vim. Gotta get some fancy maneuvers into your fingers.
And it's different between Mac and Windows.

Gotta remember to push up the git commits to make better use of time when
demonstrating these things to you...

That was a strange feedback loop. I have to make sure I have my video IDs
correct. But as you saw I took the opportunity to add markdown headlines.
There's a lot of good SEO going on in these sites too, especially long-tail
principles as I keep it on one page. That may change in the future as I add
Jupyter Notebook side-folders to do fancy tricks.

Anyhow, that'll do it for now. Oh, let me add a to-do list with a special jump
"link". There's actually link/tags in vim, but I don't use them. I prefer
unique text (usually prefixed with underscores) at the top of the document...

And now whenever I'm anywhere in that journal, I just jump to top with _jxp,
hen I find `_jxp`, nit "w" to go to next-word and shift 8 to find next
occurrence.

Okay, that's where I'll stop. I've got:

- Embedded YouTube thumbnails for the respective videos
- A ToDo list of what I want to do with that channel/journal.
