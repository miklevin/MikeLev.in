title: What If My Life Were Just Beginning Now?
headline: "Gaining Wisdom Through Life's Journey: Reflections on My 51 Years of Experience"
description: I'm 51 years old and have gained a lot of wisdom over the years. From understanding my likes and dislikes and the role of major events in my life, to recognizing the importance of financial security, I have learned a lot. I regret not taking up Python sooner, and I'm grateful for the opportunities Unix has given me. Despite the ups and downs, I wouldn't change my path and am content with how things have turned out.

So what if your life were just beginning? What if you could start over knowing
what you know now? How would things be different? Knowing your essential vibe
now such as you do? Well first of all, I think what I know now would be an
awesome friggin' starting point. I'm happy with myself, knowing my likes and
dislikes, general abilities, preference in people to be around. That sounds
like a list:

- It's important to get to know ones' own "essential vibe"... something
  determined by chance genetics... you as a "blank slate" raw material stuff.
  It's not easy to really know because by the time you're aware there is such a
  thing, you're already a very different you.
- Coming to grips with circumstances of one's birth and childhood... it's all
  just more chance, beyond your control. A 2nd random hand dealt from the deck,
  such as it were.
- Realizing the role of major events in your life of shaping you, especially
  during the "coming-of-age" years (between 6 and 12), becoming a meta-being,
  God-like in creativity, subject to peer-pressure and parental expectations,
  and predisposed towards embitterment. This is the time of Alice, Dorothy
  Gale, Harry Potter and Princess Nell.
- Piss. Understanding what pissing matches are and how they come from
  insecurity and jealousy.  Jealousy-motivated attacks and how to survive them.
  Entanglement and non-entanglement. How the "let-it-fizzle" strategy is best
  with pissers.
- The price of getting all of the above-point wrong: Snap! Snap goes the
  will-power. Breaking. Being broken like a horse. Being ridden like a horse
  for the rest of your life and not knowing there's anything wrong.
- Tricks to maintain a deep-inner self nobody but you knows or has any business
  knowing. Doing this while still an integrated being, without dissociation.
- Knowing the difference between isolation, town, village, city, metropolis,
  world-class anchor-cities and meccas.
- Different strokes for different folks. And that's fine. It takes all kinds.
- Understanding the big-man-on-campus, Alpha-to-Omega, hiding of the original
  omega, reading undercurrents and understanding community lies. The Bible and
  all the misinterpretation of the Bible. Other such stories and the eternal
  recurring stories of Gilgamesh and such.
- The lies and biases of language. The imperfection of tools in general, but
  how that's a perfect statement about life itself, and contains love-worthy
  bits.
- How most of the things that will anger you are indeed things to learn and
  internalize, but not to obsess over. You can only live your own life, and
  it's not a very long one at that.
- In fact, it's only 10 rotations around the sun for each of your fingers, and
  that's if you're lucky.
- Projection! The first thing someone complains about will tell you all about
  their self-image and insecurities. Those who make a living calling others
  narcissists are themselves narcissists... always. Sometimes it's
  understandable because you have to become like someone to survive them.  It's
  possible to recover.
- You have to condition your own mind to be the way you like it to be. This
  mostly means knowing what releases the neurotransmitter chemicals into your
  blood that causes you to have the behavior you want to have.
- For that above point, you have to get enough sleep and keep yourself
  hydrated.
- Things go in cycles. Don't be scared to go on a roller coaster ride. Just be
  sure it's a roller coaster where the odds favor your survival.
- Engage in life. Entangle. Get the best (for you) out of life. But then cut
  the fuckers off who intend you harm. Surround yourself with good people.
- Simplicity rises from complexity pushed-around in just such a way that it
  only just appears simple. Nuance and subtlety matter much more than they're
  given credit. People who write off nuance are lying motherfuckers who don't
  really understand what they're doing or themselves.

Yup. That about sums it up at first pass. Yeah, I'm fifty-one years old. Yup,
this is hard-won shit just rattled off-the-cuff in under an hour. We all have
sort of internal agents working for us in our heads.

Read SciFi. Read Non-Fiction. Both are valuable and not all of equal value.
Non-fiction is often more fictional than scifi. At least science-fiction
doesn't lie about lying. There are classics not to be missed in both
categories. Not everything is (or has to be) dystopian. The most important
SciFi to read is Ian M. Banks The Culture series because it is shows you how
badass the optimistic good guys can be.

So how would things be different knowing all of the above? I would no longer
covet becoming one of the high-tech empire-building bro's. In my time it was of
course Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. There could not be a more iconic Yin/Yang
pair. Yin's invent. Yangs copy and optimize. Clear, no? And neither path of
empire-building necessarily leads to happiness. I mean sure, material comfort.
But Jobs died unnecessarily in his sixties, and that's f'd up. Bill Gates
softened a bit in his old-age, but isn't free. He can't just go places and do
things without carrying around a reality-distortion-field. That's f'd up too.
Freedom in life is nice.

Financial security in life by saving young and deferring so many good things in
life is pretty f'd-up too because it keeps you from really trying hard and
striving. While I probably should have saved better, I'm much happier with my
internalized abilities that can't be taken away from me and can actually help
me survive when dropped into almost any situation than I would be with some
number on a screen. It seems to me that the perfect life would consist of:

- Living several places and having several vocations, sampling a lot.
- Testing the boundaries of your abilities without a safety-net. "Check" who
  you are.
- Don't do all of the above for "too long" or you won't enjoy the things about
  life that you've come to know are your favorites.
- Switch from an exploratory mode to a more enjoying-it-all mode from 1/3 to
  half-way through your life.
- Dial-up the loveworthy bits and dial-down the hateful bits.

So again, how would I do things differently if I had to do it all over again?

I don't think I would. The love-worthy bits I've discovered is the
love-of-tools and their spontaneous expert use. And the tools I fell in love
with have been maturing right along with me, and if I were solipsistic about
it, would think ***for*** me.

Perhaps I would have taken up vim circa 1996 when I first started to encounter
it. I was 26 years old living in Philadelphia working at Scala Multimedia, a
Commodore Computers spin-off, but I despised with a passion the person who
suggested I do so. He's one of the people I had to unfortunately become like to
contend with. I'm still getting over it, but it did sort of battle-harden me.

I didn't take up vim again until I moved to New York City
and Microsoft Active Server Pages (those files with a .asp extension) went out
of style along with the editors designed to edit them. 2009. I was 40 years
old. A kid was on the way. I knew that the next text-editor I took up was going
to be the last one I seriously took up in my life. I still will tackle emacs
one day, but I'm sure to enable vim-mode.

Again while I was at Scala, a friend of mine named Guillaume Proux, a French
guy living in Japan who I never met in person whose path combined with mine
through my field of SEO (search engine optimization) from a page I published on
Scala's website, told me about Python. This was somewhere around 2002 on my
second stint at Scala. I worked at Scala not long after college, after my dad
died and I took over his check cashing store, got hit on the head by a robber
with a hammer, shot him and got out of the business. I switched to software,
LOL! But the first stint was in Virginia near DC and the second stint was in
Exton, Pennsylvania. I still joke with Guillaume that I should have listened to
him then and taken up Python then. But no harm. I learned all the languages I
would not touch with a hundred-foot pole again in my life, including Ruby and
JavaScript. Blech!

Tool preference is another case of nuance and subtlety mattering. All those
people who play down the importance of your language choice are either
naturally very multi-lingual (which is a thing) or they're liars or deeply
un-self-aware. A halfling won't do very well with a 2-handed sword and a knight
in armor isn't going to wield nunchucks all too smoothly. The fact that the
pairing of self and tools doesn't make a difference, the "Turing complete"
argument that any language can do everything another language can do, so
language choice doesn't matter will do you harm. And it's even worse that the
first thing you learn is going to deeply predispose you. Don't learn BASIC
first.

That leads us to Linux and git. I'm on the fence with git. After 15 years, I
still really just use it for personal infinite undo on my own projects, and
backing up my code on Github. I'm not big on the collaboration features, just
like I don't collaborate on my writing. Coding is a form of self-expression and
git for me is keeping my art safe. So I'm neither here nor there. I would
probably have preferred Mercurial (hg) to become the unchallenged winning
distributed version control system due to its being native Python, allowing for
cool integration and easier fast-forward/rewind of your undos and SQL-like
searching through the history of your code. But so what? A dvcs system is a
dvcs. Linux, though. That's another case enitrely.

Unix, which Linux is based on, was invented on the year I was born (the
above-motioned meant-to-be for-me solipsism which I completely don't believe).
I could hardly take it up popping out of the womb, but hey. It was there. It
was invented less than 50-miles away, in fact Pompton Plains New Jersey as I
was. The Bell Labs facility where Unix was invented is right near there. It may
be an anthropomorphic effect, but again, providence much? Unix was the
formalization of interoperable operating systems, which made information tech a
viable generalized technology tool (instead of a lifetime of specialization
type of tool).

So if I were to do it all over differently, I wouldn't want to give up all the
stars aligning just-so. I'm still alive today. On other paths, I might not be.
I earn well and love what I do. On other paths, neither of those things are
necessarily true. And although my relationships have been hit-or-miss over the
years, whose haven't. I don't think I'd trade my life for any other. If I were
to do it all over again, I would be quite happy taking the exact same path.
