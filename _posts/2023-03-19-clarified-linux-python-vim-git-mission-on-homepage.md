Continue working on and refining your homepage messaging. Fix the background
color rendering problem when using Chrome on Android 9. Make your site work
well on most even semi-modern browsers and platforms, including the way it
comes up embedded in LinkedIn and such. It appears to be fancy CSS feature
issues like variables or order of operation errors.

I need to put myself on a very rigid path to productivity. People thing AIs
will either do their work for them or take their work from them. Position
yourself as the person with the right message for those portion of these people
who are receptive to the Linux, Python, vim & git message. Find 80/20-rule
wins.

Promote Literate Programming, and the Venn diagram it has with Jupyter, Python
and Markdown.

- Make your vision & message crystal-clear on your website
- Make sure it uses a TLDR; top-down so no matter where they leave, mission
  accomplished
- Collect your work or write new stuff on your most favorite topics
- Collect links to your most favorite articles, like Blub Paradox and Fire &
  Motion
- Make a collection of these links for your homepage

Made lots of edits to my homepage as a result of this thought process.
Clarified the Linux, Python, vim & git image.
