title: Okay, I'll Bite. Could Quantum Mechanics Be Related to Remote Viewing?
headline: Exploring the Intersection of Quantum Mechanics and Remote Viewing in 'Entangled Minds
description: In 'Entangled Minds' by Dean Radin, I explore the CIA's retired Stargate program and its implications for quantum mechanics and non-locality. Through this journey, I have come to realize that particles are only separate from each other because they are different wave crests popping into our realm. I also understand that coherence is meant to be erased, but quantum effects are used for life. Join me on my journey as I explore these fascinating concepts.

I just bought the Audible Entangled Minds by  Dean Radein. ESP isn't something
I'm usually interested in, but the talk about the CIA's "retired" Stargate
program has gotten to me. Quantum mechanics is just mind-boggling. Non-locality
is still rocking my worldview. It took awhile for it to set in that there are
not particles but there are only rippling quantum fields. One particle is only
separate from another because it's a different wave crest popping into our
realm. All particles are virtual, it's just some are more persistent than
others. But all this entanglement is usually erased at a macro-scale and that's
much the point of existence. Coherence is intended to be erased for answering
the big questions. Reverting to quantum effects is a sort of regression, but
it's what's used for life. The way chlorophyll works is a great example.
