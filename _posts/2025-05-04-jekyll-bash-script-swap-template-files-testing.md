## Understanding Jekyll Site Debugging

This article delves into the practical process of troubleshooting a common but stressful problem for website owners: a sudden drop in search engine traffic. The author uses a popular tool called Jekyll, a "static site generator," which takes templates and content files to build a complete website made of simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. When their Jekyll site's traffic unexpectedly plummeted, the author suspected recent changes to the site's template files (`.html`, `.css`) might be the cause.

The core of the article documents the author's methodical approach to testing this hypothesis. This involved creating duplicate versions of template files and developing a command-line script (using Bash, a common scripting language for Linux/macOS) to easily switch between the "old" and "new" versions. This allows for controlled testing to see if the templates were indeed the issue, while also showcasing a useful technique for managing different versions of site components during development or debugging. The narrative captures the real-world, sometimes messy, process of technical problem-solving.

## A Jekyll Puzzle: Debugging a Mysterious Traffic Drop with Template Toggling and "Battle Duck" Debugging

It's a familiar feeling for anyone running a website: that stomach-dropping moment when you check your analytics and see a nosedive. In my case, Google Search Console delivered the grim news â€“ traffic to my Jekyll-powered blog had inexplicably tanked. This wasn't a gradual decline; it was a cliff edge.

Panic sets in. What changed? The most immediate suspect was recent template work I'd done. Had I inadvertently introduced some SEO-unfriendly code? Broken schema? Offended the Google gods with semantic impurity?

### The Context: A Rapidly Growing Blog

My blog documents my development process, often involving explorations with AI tools â€“ not as a spam engine, mind you, but as a genuine chronicle of using AI in coding, debugging, and learning. It had been growing steadily, recently crossing the 250-article threshold, up from around 200 in a relatively short burst. A key feature (or perhaps, culprit?) is the homepage: a single, monolithic index listing *every single article*. Could this rapid expansion and massive index page be the issue?

### Hypothesis #1: Blame the Templates! (The First Wrong Turn)

Ignoring the potential scale issues for a moment, my developer instincts screamed "recent changes first!" I decided the most immediate action was to isolate the template changes. To do this systematically, I needed a way to quickly revert *and* re-apply the newer templates.

This led to the creation of parallel file sets for the core templates and styles I'd modified:

1.  **Layouts:**
    * `_layouts/default.html` (The active file)
    * `_layouts/default-new.html` (The newer version I suspected)
    * `_layouts/default-old.html` (Where the previously active version would be saved)
    * *(Repeated for `_layouts/post.html`)*
2.  **Styles:**
    * `assets/css/styles.css` (Active)
    * `assets/css/styles-new.css` (Newer)
    * `assets/css/styles-old.css` (Backup)
3.  **Homepage Content:**
    * `index.md` (Active)
    * `index-new.md` (Newer)
    * `index-old.md` (Backup)

The idea was simple: rename the active file to `-old`, then rename the `-new` file to become the active one. To revert, rename the active file back to `-new`, and rename the `-old` file back to active.

### Manual Swapping: The Command-Line Shuffle

Doing this manually required pairs of `mv` (move/rename) commands, chained with `&&` to ensure the second command only runs if the first succeeds. For each pair, the command to activate the "new" version looked like this (using `index.md` as the example, which resides in the project root):

```bash
# Activate the 'new' version of index.md
mv index.md index-old.md && mv index-new.md index.md
```

And similarly for the others, adjusting paths as needed:

```bash
# Activate new default layout
mv _layouts/default.html _layouts/default-old.html && mv _layouts/default-new.html _layouts/default.html

# Activate new post layout
mv _layouts/post.html _layouts/post-old.html && mv _layouts/post-new.html _layouts/post.html

# Activate new styles
mv assets/css/styles.css assets/css/styles-old.css && mv assets/css/styles-new.css assets/css/styles.css
```

I swapped back to the presumed "old" (stable) templates using the reverse logic (e.g., `mv index.md index-new.md && mv index-old.md index.md`). I waited. The traffic did not recover. Hypothesis #1 was likely wrong.

### Hypothesis #2: Scale, Links, and Growth Rate

With the templates seemingly exonerated, suspicion fell on the other factors:
* The sheer number of links on the homepage index (>250).
* The rapid rate of adding new content.
* Potentially some interaction between these and how Google crawls/indexes large, rapidly changing sites.

Addressing these requires more involved changes (pagination, smarter indexing strategies), which take time away from other priorities. However, I still needed the *ability* to toggle the templates easily for future testing or if I changed my mind again. Doing the four pairs of `mv` commands manually was tedious and error-prone. Automation was needed.

### Enter the Toggle Script: `swap-templates.sh`

The goal: a single script that, when run, would detect the current state (original or new templates active) and automatically perform all the necessary swaps to switch to the *other* state.

**The Logic:** The script determines the state by checking for the existence of one of the `-old` files. If `_layouts/default-old.html` exists, it means the "new" set is currently active, and the script should swap back to the original. If it *doesn't* exist, the original set is active, and the script should swap to the new set.

**The Script:** After some iteration (and correcting paths when deciding where the script should live!), here is the final version, designed to be placed in a `_scripts` directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# SCRIPT LOCATION: _scripts/swap-templates.sh
# BASE PROJECT DIR: ../ (relative to this script)

# --- Configuration ---
# Directories relative to the script's location (_scripts)
# We need to go one level up to find these folders/files
BASE_DIR=".."
LAYOUTS_DIR="$BASE_DIR/_layouts" # Now ../_layouts
CSS_DIR="$BASE_DIR/assets/css"   # Now ../assets/css

# File paths (now constructed relative to ../)

### Integrating the Script Safely into Jekyll

A crucial detail: where should this utility script live within the Jekyll project structure? We need it version-controlled and easily accessible, but absolutely *not* copied into the final `_site` directory during the build process.

After considering putting it in `_data` (semantically wrong) or using a regular `scripts/` directory and adding it to `_config.yml`'s `exclude` list (requires config change), the best practice emerged:

**Use a directory prefixed with an underscore: `_scripts/`**

Jekyll automatically ignores any directory starting with `_` that isn't one of its special, recognized directories. This means creating a `_scripts/` folder in the project root provides perfect organization for utility scripts while guaranteeing they stay out of the build output, all without touching `_config.yml`.

So, the script now resides at `_scripts/swap-templates.sh`. To run it, navigate to the project root directory in the terminal and execute:

```bash
chmod +x _scripts/swap-templates.sh # Make executable (only needed once)
./_scripts/swap-templates.sh     # Run the toggle
```

### The Journey Continues: Embracing "Battle Duck" Data

So, the traffic mystery isn't fully solved. The prime suspects are now site scale and index structure. But this entire debugging journey â€“ the initial misdiagnosis, the creation of parallel files, the iterative development of shell commands, the automation into a robust toggle script, and the research into proper Jekyll project structure for utilities â€“ is valuable in itself.

It's a perfect example of what happens in real-world development. It's messy, iterative, and involves correcting course. Documenting this, perhaps with the help of AI like in our conversation, produces something more valuable than purely synthetic examples. It's data refined by actual use, by troubleshooting, by hitting dead ends. It's not just "rubber ducking" â€“ explaining the problem to an inanimate object (or AI). It's data hardened by the process. Maybe we should call it **"Battle Duck" Data**? Tested in the trenches, refined by reality.

For now, I have a handy script to toggle my templates should I need it again, and a clearer path forward investigating the impact of my blog's scale. And, of course, another pedantically detailed post for the blog â€“ hopefully, this one doesn't break anything!

* Minor formatting issues in the raw input's code blocks (some commands run together without line breaks).

**AI Opinion:**
This article provides significant value as a practical case study in debugging and developer tooling within the context of Jekyll. Its strength lies in the meticulous documentation of the process for creating the template-toggling script, including path considerations and best practices for script placement. While the underlying traffic issue isn't resolved, the script itself is a useful artifact, and the troubleshooting thought process is instructive. The clarity is good for its likely target audience (developers, Jekyll users), though the narrative style makes it more of a "journey log" than a concise tutorial. The "Battle Duck" idea adds personality but slightly detracts from the technical focus at the end.
