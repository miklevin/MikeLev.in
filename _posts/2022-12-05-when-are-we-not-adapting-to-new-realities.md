title: When Are We Not Adapting to New Realities?
headline: "Exploring the Options: Reusing Pipulate, Using DrinkMe Linux, or Creating a Modern Noah's Ark Platform"
description: Today I'm excited to read the last book in the ExForce SciFi series. I'm also working on a project and considering reusing the Pipulate library, using the DrinkMe Linux platform, or creating a modern Noah's Ark platform. I need to be aware of vendors trying to lure me into a dependency and alternatives to local Jupyter. Join me as I explore the options and decide which is best for my project.

Getting started with a new day. Excited about midnight tonight when the next
and last book of the ExForce SciFi series starting Skippy, the AI, comes out.
My place is still a mess. Didn't do as much as I had planned over the weekend
because I was watching Criag of the Creek along with Adi, for which I am glad.
I like having similar taste in TV programs as my kid, at least on the
cartoon-front.

Okay, let's get to work. Another day, another expansion to... do I really want
to market it as "DinkMe" Linux when I have the perfectly good and
ought-to-be-reused Pipulate to work with. I should probably retire it in
PyPi.org, especially if I reuse it in this way. Think! I could always update
the pipulate library. Make it what mlseo was sort of becoming, but this is
better than than that because I own the domain, it's a made-up word, and it
doesn't imply machine learning SEO, which I should also be addressing, but each
thing in time.

On the other hand, DrinkMe does have that strong Alice in Wonderland adventure
connotation. It also plays off of a bit of groundwork I put in with Levinux.

Let's get through the tooling and infrastructure part of... of
what? A sort of modern Noah's Ark platform. A basic unit of Linux-computing,
now courtesy of Microsoft. Just don't lose those systemd services to stupid
Microsoft decisions to freeze Linux services in the background. Yup. Microsoft
has decided to freeze Linux services in the background and this really puts a
damper on my plans to always run Jupyter Server that way.

Every vendor product is trying to lure you into a dependency.

Everyone with an alternative to local Jupyter
