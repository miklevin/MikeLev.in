Okay, I just changed my `YAMLChop` repo on Github to private. It's amazing the
hoops Github puts you through to do that. There most have been tons of
complaints about people who lost their Github Stars from doing that because it
actually made me type the ***number of stars*** YAMLChop had before turning it
to private. I lost lots of stars on Levinux that way in the past, haha! Anyhow,
that capability is now under the `_code` folder of the `journal` repo that's
now a standard part of MyKoz.AI. It's better there.

Okay, think! Keep tension in the machinery. Just keep writing and just keep
going. Get an amazing amount done each day until the momentum takes on a life
of its own and you always simply know what to do next and why. I need to get
the `chop.py` loaded into my vim buffers for regular editing. 

Ah, I see where I went wrong last time. The current `all` program I use, which
is a modification of the `vimit` file under MyKoz.AI has the post-editing
copy-command reversed. Okay, so I need to exit this and let it do that copy,
then edit the `all` program in its `~/pyenv/bin` location and then copy it into
my `_code` folder in my journal repo. Then I run `all` again and any edits to
it should be permanent. Go!

Okay, that's done. Now make an edit to `all` and `chop.py` and see if they
stick. This is important for a sort of real-time flexible feedback loop that I
want my system to have. Refine, flex and evolve it while I use it.

Okay, let's update the Figlet function in the `chop.py` program to support
other than its default font. Take the function from `all`. Okay, now look at
how `all` uses a smaller ASCII art headline size... 

Okay that worked. But I have to "bring up" all the text above the fold so that
people don't know how to use vim navigation commands after they release a site.
That's too much to ask for people doing this for the first time. So get away
from my Figlet fixation. Maybe just edit the figlet function!

No, that wasn't enough. To get this blog release system ready for prime-time
given the folks who are going to be trying to use this, I have to eliminate as
much vertical scrolling as I can. The figlet function is almost no longer
invoked, except for errors. I added one opening Figlet "banner" so that there's
some nice visual branding. It's "Chopping...". That's all the user needs to see
in Figlet. The rest is put in ASCII bullet-point style now.

Alright, I really love how improving `chop.py` on my actual published blog
improves it for the MyKoz.AI project as well. This takes care of one of the
pain points that would be encountered as I roll this out to the world.

Okay, think out the next and the next and the next steps. Analyze the pain
points. Do the imaginary soft-launches of MyKoz.AI in your head.

Now that it has WebDev built in from yesterday's work, I really have to adjust
the overall pitch.

- Don't go obsolete.
- Future-proof yourself.
- Focus on the timeless tech.
- Thrive even while AIs learn to code.
- Keep a 1-textfile journal for life (in vim).
- Ease into Linux through Python in a Windows browser.
- Turn Jupyter Notebooks into automated Linux services.
- Take up WebDev in non JavaScript-framework dependent way.

There will always be a distraction. You need a distraction reaction that takes
the power away from whatever it is that derails you. You can't necessarily do
it in one pass. It's going to take systematic and progressive habit-building.
However, the first steps are easy; small concessions, really.

One of the things I'm trying to do is to make doom-scrolling a Pavlovian
condition for switching here to vim journaling. Be aware of the energy
time-sinks that set you back with an effect like the reverse of compounding
interest. Those are the worst because they steal time that could be working for
you with the analogous effect of compounding interest, but in whatever way you
choose. Internal skills, in my case. A lot of people go with the financial
savings here, but all that can be taken away from you. What's inside of you
can't. Or at least it's a lot harder to.

Okay, all my refinements have been without blog posts needing the OpenAI
involvement (re-publishing already published stuff). Let's see how it looks on
this blog post as I let OpenAI create the subhead, description and keywords.
