Okay, I worked all the kinks out of the WSL2 installer script that installs a
Linux version of JupyterLab on Windows. This is big and nobody knows it, haha!
There's so many advantages to this it's ridiculous. But the mainstream world
isn't going to "get it". I need better messaging. Better marketing. Better
meme-ability. It has to be meme-able.

What am I really getting at here? Why not just go the "all the bells and
whistles" Microsoft VSCode route? Why not just use the full-blown JupyterLab
installed with Anaconda? Or even the native Windows version of Desktop-Jupyter
from Github? The idea is to settle on the timeless "cloud" tools that will
always be around, and that you can always count on. 

And that's the Linux command-line, and the Python programming language with
standard file paths and forward slashes. The problem I'm solving is all that
"exception handling" which is a subtle form of "lock-in" and an energy drain,
especially over the years. It's a form of "technical debt" keeping you from
being able to move your work around from place to place in a friction free way.
It's just letting your work flow onto the Cloud, Raspberry Pi's and the like.

By pairing down what you have to take on, I'm letting you take on more. I'm
shifting the balance of power from the "system" to the "user". I'm shifting the
balance of power from the "corporation" to the "individual". It's not going to
be beloved by the big companies, but so what? Also, it's precisely what's needed
to give you a respite from the always-on, always-connected AI suggestions that
are bullying their way into a favorite piece of software near you.

Okay, so Stoicism. Yup. More people even know what that is these days thanks to
the YouTube's and re-emergence of the "philosophy" genre. In particular, Marcus
Aurelius is the most famous Stoic, and his book "Meditations" is the most
famous book of Stoicism. It's a book of journal entries and the direction I'm
taking this project is doing journaling in vim as a way to make the transition
to text-based Linux easier.

Wow, the connection is so obvious now. Can I call the Linux version Marcus
Aurelius Linux? Nahhh, be more subtle. How about Marcus OS? Mark Us? My Cause?
Mike Levin's Cause? MyCoz? MyKoz? Gotta see it in Figlet ASCII art before I can
decide. Here we go...

Marcus

While this is remarkably strong, "Py" gets plenty of coverage. This is more
about "My Cause" than the "Python Cause" so I'm going with MyKoz. But it needs a
colon in there.

MyKoz: ARealOS... wow, that's strong. That's ***really*** strong. See if you can
get that to work as an ASCII art banner you can use in the installer. Stay under
80 characters wide.

Yup. Bye bye White Rabbit Linux, Rabbit Hole Linux, Levinux, Noah's Ark Linux
and all these other names I've come up with over the years. This is My Cause,
and it's time to encode that into the name. It also gets "Oz" which is
meaningful to me, along with sounding like Marcus Aurelius, which implies the
sort of stoic, mindful, and timelessness this project is all about.
