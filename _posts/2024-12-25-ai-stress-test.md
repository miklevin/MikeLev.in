## The Journey Begins

Take a deep breath.

We are not going to try to boil the ocean.

You can not get there today, but you can make directional adjustments that will
help you a wee little bit today, and set the stage for tomorrow.

By continuously making those tiny but helpful directional adjustments, you'll
get there.

## Christmas Day Reflections

Today is Wednesday, December 25, 2024. For most people, that makes it Christmas.
For me, it's a day off. But there are really no days off for those in the
mindset such as I'm in currently. Solving the immediate problems is what feeds
the soul. Never so humorously have I seen that expressed as in the Star Trek
cartoon Lower Decks where the Engineering team is under orders to relax and
relieve stress. Their solution at this alien spa rather than to lean into the
process was to build a machine that just does it, and by practicing their
engineering skills to real-world, meaningful effect they relaxed.

### On Introverts and Innovation

Oh, the sub-references I could make here! For as long as probably civilization
itself, extroverts shamed introverts asserting that there was something or other
wrong with them. Then along comes Elon Musk and the whole brigade of founder
power-nerds before him showing the road more traveled is the road the
group-think herd mentality wore through the landscape as ruts. Are you in a rut?
Maybe you have over-helpful extroverts to thank.

## The AI Testing Ground

But I will avoid that tangent because I wrote enough yesterday. My task is
initialized. I have access to the $200/mo paid version of OpenAI ChatGPT o1 Pro,
which is supposed to be the closest thing to AGI in the public's hands today,
and I'm going to take advantage of that.

I also have through my bare minimum 2TB Google One membership, access to Gemini
2.0. Then I have Claude 3.5 Sonnet pretty much unlimited (what an amazing
loophole) through my $20/mo Cursor AI subscription. That makes 3 top-of-the-line
public-facing frontier AI models. And so all I need is a problem.

### The Challenge of Web Frameworks

Oh, and have I got a problem! I'm on the 3rd version of a generalized web
framework system, in as many decades. Yup, I measure these things in decades.
This is not my first rodeo with this stuff, and I walk away from it for years at
a time based on what my day-job is and the state of the tools at the time. I
hate tech-churn. I'm a slow learner and I like to get good at a small number of
things over a long period of time, and that's not the field of tech.

### The Enduring Text Editors

Oh, except for the great granddaddy text editors of the ages: vim and emacs. I
guess we just have to say vim now, even though it's sandwiched on both sides by
different versions: vi and nvim. Oh such another story here, and the "great"
text-editors that shaped our world are probably really vi and emacs, but nobody
says that anymore. In another amazing Amiga computer tie-in, ever since 1991
when vim (vi iMproved) was released by Bram Moolenaar on Fred Fish public domain
disk #591, the world ditched vi for vim and never looked back... unless you're
on BusyBox or other micro embedded devices. Then, you're probably using vi. It's
part of the Unix standard, after all.

### Forever Tools in Technology

Anyhow, point being there are forever-tools in tech. You probably don't think so
because nobody makes any money off of them, so established as free and open
source software (FOSS) as they are plagued with a reputation for steep learning
curves, nobody tries. That's a darn shame, because it's just like riding a bike.
It may take awhile to get there, but once you're there, the skill is a permanent
forever-forward part of you, and you can hop on almost any bicycle for the rest
of your life. vi/vim/nvim is a lot like that. And there's a bunch of other stuff
like that too, but that's another tangent.

### The Web's Resistance to Timelessness

Point being, that even the Web itself has been very reluctant to enter the ranks
of timeless. Oh, you'd think it would be the universal user interface for all
things now, having been around for several decades now, and web browsers being
pervasive and ubiquitous, on every computer, on every phone, and even the basis
of operating systems themselves from Palm's WebOS to Google's ChromeOS. And all
these browsers by mandate of the vendors who control them run only one
programming language, JavaScript. And so you'd think it would have killed or
taken the place of all the native proprietary interfaces like Windows and macOS.
There should be no more UI building-kits in Python like TCL/TK (tkinter), and
QT. And certainly the Linux desktops like GNOME and KDE (QT, again) should have
switched over. But none of them have! Hey Perplexity, What's TCL/TK and QT? And
what else is there like them?

**Perplexity**: TCL/TK and Qt are both popular tools for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and developing applications, but they have some key differences:

## TCL/TK

TCL (Tool Command Language) is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language[1]. TK is a cross-platform widget toolkit that provides a library of basic GUI elements[2]. Together, they form a powerful combination for rapid application development.

**Key features of TCL/TK:**
- Simple and easy to learn
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Interpreted language
- Embedded scripting capabilities
- Rapid prototyping

TCL/TK is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a good choice for beginners and for quick prototyping[5].

## Qt

Qt is a comprehensive C++ application framework for developing cross-platform applications[4]. It provides a rich set of libraries and tools for creating GUIs, as well as non-GUI functionality.

**Key features of Qt:**
- Extensive widget library
- Cross-platform development
- C++ based, with bindings for other languages
- Powerful GUI designer tools
- Comprehensive documentation

Qt is often considered more powerful and feature-rich than TCL/TK, but it may have a steeper learning curve[6].

## Other Similar Tools

There are several other tools and frameworks available for GUI development:

1. **wxWidgets**: A cross-platform GUI toolkit for C++[4].

2. **GTK+**: A multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.

3. **Kivy**: An open-source Python library for developing cross-platform applications with natural user interfaces[6].

4. **JavaFX**: A software platform for creating desktop applications and Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) in Java.

5. **Tkinter**: A standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, which is simpler than Qt but comes bundled with Python[6].

Each of these tools has its own strengths and is suited for different types of projects and developer preferences. The choice between them often depends on factors such as the programming language you prefer, the complexity of your project, and the specific features you need[6].

**Me**: Excellent! But we might as well flesh it out a wee bit more. What's KDE
and its relationship to QT?

**Perplexity**: KDE (originally standing for Kool Desktop Environment) is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems. Its history and relationship with Qt are closely intertwined:

## Origins and Early Development

KDE was announced on October 14, 1996, by Matthias Ettrich[1]. The project aimed to create a user-friendly desktop environment for Unix systems, using the Qt framework developed by Trolltech (now part of The Qt Company).

## Key Milestones

- July 12, 1998: KDE 1.0 was released, marking the first stable version[1][5].
- October 23, 2000: KDE 2.0 was released, bringing significant improvements[1].
- April 3, 2002: KDE 3 was released, further enhancing the desktop environment[5].
- January 11, 2008: KDE 4 was released, introducing major changes and new features[5].
- July 15, 2014: KDE Plasma 5 was released, representing a significant evolution of the KDE desktop[5].

## Relationship with Qt

The relationship between KDE and Qt is fundamental:

1. Qt as the foundation: KDE is built on top of the Qt framework, which provides the core libraries and tools for developing KDE applications[6].

2. KDE Free Qt Foundation: In 1998, KDE e.V. and Trolltech created this foundation to ensure Qt's availability as free software[3]. This agreement allows KDE to fork Qt if it ever becomes fully commercial[4].

3. Interdependence: While KDE depends on Qt for its core functionality, the KDE community has also contributed significantly to Qt's development and improvement over the years.

4. Licensing: Qt's dual-licensing model (open-source and commercial) has sometimes caused concerns, but the KDE Free Qt Foundation helps maintain Qt's open-source availability[4].

## Evolution of KDE

Over time, KDE has evolved from a single desktop environment to a community producing a wide range of software:

- In 2009, the name "KDE" shifted to represent the community rather than just the desktop environment[5].
- The project split into KDE Plasma (the desktop environment), KDE Frameworks (core libraries), and KDE Applications[5].

This evolution has allowed KDE to adapt to changing technologies and user needs while maintaining its close relationship with Qt.

**Me**: Why hasn't the Web as a sort of universal user interface killed TK and QT?

**Perplexity**: The Web hasn't completely replaced traditional GUI frameworks like Tk and Qt for several reasons:

1. Performance and responsiveness: Native GUI applications often provide better performance and more responsive interfaces compared to web applications[5]. This is crucial for applications that require high-speed interactions or complex computations.

2. Hardware access: Native GUI frameworks like Qt offer lower-level access to hardware, which is essential for applications that need to interact directly with system resources[5]. Web applications are limited by browser security mechanisms.

3. Offline functionality: Desktop applications can work offline, while web applications typically require an internet connection[1].

4. Specialized widgets: Traditional GUI frameworks offer a wide range of built-in widgets with advanced functionality, which are not readily available in web browsers[2].

5. Development consistency: Native GUI frameworks provide more consistent development experiences across platforms, whereas web development often involves dealing with browser inconsistencies[2].

6. Security and data privacy: Some applications require higher levels of security or local data processing, which is more easily achieved with native applications[1].

7. Specific use cases: Certain applications, such as graphics software or complex games, are better suited for native development due to performance requirements and access to system resources[5].

8. Legacy systems: Many existing applications built with Tk or Qt continue to be maintained and updated, as rewriting them as web applications would be time-consuming and potentially unnecessary[3].

While web technologies have advanced significantly, they haven't entirely replaced the need for native GUI frameworks. The choice between web and native interfaces often depends on specific project requirements, target audience, and development resources.

**Me**: How does the churn of NodeJS versions and JavaScript client frameworks factor in?

**Perplexity**: The churn of NodeJS versions and JavaScript client frameworks is a significant factor in the web development ecosystem, impacting both developers and organizations in several ways:

## Constant Evolution

NodeJS and JavaScript frameworks are in a state of continuous evolution, with frequent updates and new releases. This rapid pace of change brings both benefits and challenges:

1. Improved features and performance: Regular updates often introduce new capabilities, optimizations, and security patches[1].

2. Learning curve: Developers must constantly adapt to new versions, APIs, and best practices, which can be time-consuming[3].

3. Dependency management: Projects relying on multiple packages may face compatibility issues as dependencies update at different rates[1].

## Impact on Development

The churn affects development processes and decision-making:

1. Version management: Organizations must decide whether to stay on older, stable versions or regularly upgrade to newer ones[3].

2. Technical debt: Delaying updates can lead to accumulated technical debt, making future upgrades more challenging[1].

3. Framework selection: The rapidly changing landscape makes it difficult to choose long-term solutions, as popularity and support can shift quickly[8].

## Strategies for Dealing with Churn

To manage the impact of churn, developers and organizations employ various strategies:

1. Selective adoption: Carefully evaluating new versions and features before adoption, rather than immediately upgrading[3].

2. Dependency analysis: Assessing the downstream dependencies of packages to minimize potential conflicts and update frequency[1].

3. Automated testing: Implementing robust testing suites to catch breaking changes during upgrades[7].

4. Modular architecture: Designing applications with loosely coupled components to facilitate easier updates and replacements[9].

## Positive Aspects of Churn

Despite the challenges, the churn in the JavaScript ecosystem also brings benefits:

1. Innovation: Rapid iteration leads to faster problem-solving and the emergence of better solutions[9].

2. Community growth: The dynamic nature of the ecosystem encourages active participation and collaboration among developers[9].

3. Performance improvements: Frequent updates often result in better performance and efficiency[6].

In conclusion, while the churn of NodeJS versions and JavaScript frameworks presents challenges, it also drives innovation and improvement in the web development landscape. Successful navigation of this ecosystem requires a balanced approach to adoption, careful planning, and a commitment to ongoing learning and adaptation.

## The Python / HTMX Hypothesis

**Me**: Well, I have a hypothesis. Call it the Python / HTMX hypothesis. The
Python community doesn't like that kind of churn. There are legendary examples
from the story of migration from Python 2 to 3 to the more recent controversy
around the walrus operator. Python people don't like their APIs breaking. Also
Python itself after 30 years is only on version 3. That's a version per decade,
while Node is up to version 23. Now I know that's greatly just labels, but major
version number increments does tend to correlate to breaking API changes,
lending more credence to the stable nature of Python APIs. Add that to the
stable nature of the Web standards such as HTML itself, which only went to
version 5, and that was 10 years ago, in 2014. And finally, layer in the
potential significance of HTMX as a capability-extending layer of HTML. 

### A New Path Forward

With just a lightweight Python framework wrapper like FastHTML, a sort of
timelessness and brand new resistance to obsolescence and churn is being infused
into the web development landscape, making the web a more viable alternative now
to TK and QT. This is particularly true if the client/server model disrupting
patterns of Electron were more generically applied, such as bundling whole
system infrastructures with nix flakes. There is now a sort of timelessness and
craft that is possible in tech due to the relative stability of a new blend of
anti-pattern parts.

Perplexity: Your Python / HTMX hypothesis presents an intriguing perspective on the evolving landscape of web development and GUI frameworks. Let's analyze the key points:

1. Python's Stability: Python's conservative approach to version increments and API changes aligns with the community's preference for stability. The Python 2 to 3 migration and the walrus operator controversy indeed highlight this tendency[7].

2. Version Numbering: Python's version 3 after 30 years contrasts sharply with Node.js's rapid progression to version 23. However, it's important to note that Node.js follows a different versioning strategy, with even-numbered versions becoming LTS releases[1].

3. Web Standards Stability: HTML5, finalized in 2014, has since become a living standard, evolving without major version changes. This stability in web standards provides a solid foundation for long-term development[3].

4. HTMX and FastHTML: These technologies leverage the stability of HTML while extending its capabilities. FastHTML, for instance, allows for creating modern web applications in pure Python, potentially reducing the need for frequent framework updates[6][8].

5. Resistance to Obsolescence: The combination of Python's stability, HTML's longevity, and tools like HTMX and FastHTML could indeed create a more durable development ecosystem, potentially rivaling traditional GUI frameworks like Tk and Qt.

6. Client/Server Model and Bundling: The idea of bundling system infrastructures (e.g., with nix flakes) could further enhance the viability of web technologies as alternatives to native GUI frameworks.

Your hypothesis suggests a convergence of stable technologies that could provide a more sustainable approach to application development. This stability-focused ecosystem might indeed offer an attractive alternative to the rapid churn often associated with JavaScript frameworks and Node.js versions.

However, it's worth noting that while stability has its benefits, it can also slow down innovation. The balance between stability and progress remains a challenge in the tech industry.

In conclusion, your hypothesis presents a compelling case for a more stable, long-lasting approach to web and application development, leveraging the strengths of Python, HTML, and emerging technologies like HTMX and FastHTML.

**Me**: This is a request for your open-ended thoughts. We make the future. Help me make this future.

**o1 Pro**: Here’s a bit of open-ended, free-flowing riff on your ideas:

---

**1. The Calm in the Swirl of Churn**  
The immediacy of web tech has always felt like it’s teetering on chaos—new frameworks, new bundlers, new concept-laden client-side architectures. It’s little wonder that one can dream of a stable oasis in that swirling sea. Your observation about Python’s slower, more measured pace of evolution (major version changes once every decade or so) is a breath of fresh air in a world that’s always cycling through what’s “next.” If there’s a way to harness that energy of “stability meets incremental improvement”—and you pair it with a similarly stable base like HTML—then you can see how HTMX fits beautifully. It’s almost like a quiet rebellion: no more re-inventing the entire front-end every year when, in truth, a well-worn approach might carry you further.

**2. The Subtlety of Mastery**  
There’s also this premise that mastery in tools—like the Amiga world, or vi/vim/nvim, or any “forever” tool—takes years (sometimes decades) to refine, but once you reach that point, there is a deeper joy. In web development, real mastery often got sidetracked by the churn: you might become a React expert today only to find the entire environment has shifted by tomorrow. The synergy you’re exploring (Python + stable HTML5 + HTMX layering) could allow people to focus on architectural elegance, domain-specific insights, and craft—rather than re-teaching their fingers a new set of build commands every few months. That’s more reminiscent of old-school computing—like retrocomputers where the entire system was knowable, hackable, and had longevity.

**3. Layered Stability**  
What’s interesting is the potential synergy with NixOS. If you combine the inherent stability of Python and the WYSIWYG reliability of HTML with fully reproducible system configurations, you might actually carve out a path that resists the ephemeral approach many people default to (spinning Docker images, ephemeral deployments that can vanish, and so on). In other words, for those who want the calm of a stable, well-understood environment—where every layer from OS to deployment is pinned and reproducible—you’re describing a stack that can last. That might not make headlines in the same way a brand-new JavaScript or AI framework does, but it arguably builds a more solid bedrock under your feet.

**4. The HTMX Factor**  
HTMX is, in some ways, a revelation. It doesn’t replace all the fancy front-end approaches if your application demands them, but for a broad swath of web tasks, it exemplifies “enough is enough.” It elegantly extends HTML to handle “modern” web interactions while steering clear of a mountainous JavaScript codebase. The more folks see that “You can do a ton with nothing but your server, simple markup, and a dab of HTMX,” the more they’ll realize how over-engineered many standard stacks have become. FastHTML—gluing HTMX’s minimal approach with Python’s comfort—could be a perfect expression of that “80/20 rule” you champion.

**5. Crafting a Future, Not Just Consuming It**  
The bigger theme you’re pointing to is that we collectively shape the tools that shape us. If enough of us say “We want the tools to endure,” we might see a subtle shift—away from ephemeral churn and toward frameworks designed with backward compatibility and long-term resilience in mind. It’s akin to how the Linux kernel or Python’s core have been managed: changes happen, but there’s a high reverence for stability.

**6. Why This Matters**  
Ultimately, it might come down to personal preference: some folks thrive in churn; they love trying new frameworks. But a large swath of engineers get whiplash from that approach and want to invest in lifetime skills, muscle memory, and the satisfaction of mastery. The new wave—your “Python + HTMX + reproducible deployments” angle—may be especially compelling to them. When you build software in this stable yet modern way, you also get time to do what developers love best: solve real problems, rather than forever re-wiring the same old scaffolding.

**7. An Invitation to Experiment**  
If there’s one thing to glean from your perspective, it’s this: as soon as someone picks up a simple but powerful approach—like an HTMX-based Python stack—there’s a sense of liberation. They realize, “Oh, I didn’t *need* all that other scaffolding to get a project up and running. I can do so much with a server, some Python, and HTML.” This might be that inflection point where enough devs try it out, see the results, and spread the gospel. Or it might remain a niche for those who value craftsmanship above hype. Either way, it’s a path that leads to more serenity in code.

**8. Making the Future**  
To directly echo your call: “We make the future.” Indeed we do, every time we choose (or decline) a framework, push a library, or share an approach. The more we show that stable, minimal, and well-reasoned tech can stand toe-to-toe with the flavor-of-the-month frameworks, the more likely it is that a movement forms. So keep sharing that message, demonstrating prototypes that highlight the power of your chosen stack, and encouraging those who crave a calmer workflow to embrace it. Over time, that’s how real change—like the once-unthinkable mainstream acceptance of open source—happens. It starts with a few folks who believe there is a better way, and who don’t mind being slightly out of the mainstream to prove it.

---

So, yes, the Python / HTMX hypothesis is more than just a solution to churn. It’s an emblem of choosing a slower, more enduring, and more deeply satisfying relationship with software tools—one that can give the gift of creative focus and actual problem-solving, instead of forcing you to keep re-learning what button to press where. That’s a vision worth pushing forward.
