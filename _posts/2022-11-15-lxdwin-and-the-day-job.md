So distracted, but in a good way. The LXDWIN project keeps pulling me in and
that's where much of my future resides for a multitude of reasons. It feels so
right, the culmination of everything I've been doing with Linux, Python, vim &
git, and my pet projects, Levinux, Pipulate, mlseo and all the rest. But I
really have to focus on slamming out a to-do item for my day-job that I've been
having difficulty "finding the love in". But that's not an option. We have to
do it. We have to discipline our minds and get it done. 1, 2, 3... 1?

Do this work locally and not on the server. Do it with the latest LXDWIN
instance and that's the first part to making it love-worthy.
