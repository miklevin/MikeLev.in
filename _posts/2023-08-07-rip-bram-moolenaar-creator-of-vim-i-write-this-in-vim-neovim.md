Today I refined MyKoz.AI, a foray into Linux, Python, vim & git for the
uninitiated wanting a bit of old-school power. Today I learned that Bram
Moolenaar, the creator of vim died on August 34d at the age of 62. I can hardly
write this without choking up. I write this in NeoVim and not vim, but that's
only because Copilot needs the NeoVim API. Otherwise vim and NeoVim are nearly
identical, NeoVim being a fork of vim. 

Today is going to be an epic day for me. It's still just around 7:00 AM and if
I bear down, I can get all this done. I can start to Twitch stream the creation
of this endeavor from what amounts to "from scratch". I can break each part
down into an interesting topic, like hosting or headless CMS. There's so many
ways I could spin this, and I think the important thing will be to tell the
overarching story.

Continue with most of your thought-work and shaping of MyKoz.AI occurring here
on the MikeLev.in site. Get the installer working with the new (and rebased)
repos I ideated yesterday:

- README.txt: Leave a readme file on desktop.
- Intro Repo: Clear Instructions for the Newbie
- NeoVim path: Show them how to start vimtutor.
- Pipulate Repo: Reboot FOSS SEO from scratch.
- WHIM Repo: With Help, I Monitor (systemd)

You HAVE TO know what to do next and why. Windows 11 works against you a bit,
removing that "fixed location" feeling of Windows 10. I've stopped always
having Jupyter on Screen 2, but I now have a browser there. That means screen
1, 2 and 3 are not fixed in my mind anymore. Just 1 and 2 are.

Okay, the new mental model is 3 virtual screens. We nix the total of 7 that I
usually have open down to 3 and leave the option open to pop back open our 7
comfortable screens. I'm comfortable with 7 but 7 is not necessary out of the
starting gate. 3 are. And in this case, it's Journals, Browser and MyKoz.AI
installer, loaded into vim (really, NeoVim but I'm going to say vim today
because of Bram).

Another thing I'm doing is no longer leaving icons out on the desktop. That's
just clutter and excessively predisposing. I'll load what I load and don't need
keyboard shortcuts to get to it. This is a place where you just have to bite
the bullet and learn each OS's mouse-free way of launching software. On
Windows, it's one tap on the `Windows` key and then starting to type the
software's name such as `Terminal` and then hitting `Enter`. Get into that
habit. It's more keystrokes, but you'll never have to "settle into" new
hardware with the leaving icons on the desktop step. And it looks more striking
and unique for the videos.

As part of the minimalism approach, I also close as many tabs I can in the
browser. If the last tab is not relevant to what I'm doing, I open a new
"blank" tab and close the irrelevant one. So journal in screen 1 and blank
browser on screen 2 and Terminal on screen 3 with the installer loaded.

Alright, I'm cleaning up the MyKoz repo a bit, catching and changing any
remaining references from drinkme to mykoz. Also got the 2 instances on
MikeLev.in, the homepage and the /mykoz/ page. 

Don't get distracted! I started to get distracted over NUMA Nvidia GPU support.
But put that to the side for now. The issues might be complex under WSL2. Go
for minimum viable product by the end of today. Make something that will knock
peoples' socks off according to the 80/20-Rule, but nothing deeper. Up-front
honesty: this won't have native GPU-support for machine learning model training
in its initial current form. But that's okay. You can use it to orchestrate the
learnings with the work offloaded to more capable hardware.

Get the readme outputting! Also work on the Introduction repository. Have the
readme direct the person directly into the Intro repository.
