Okay, what can't I get across without just the main pages:

- Home
- Linux
- Python
- vim
- git
- blog

Now that the age of long-tail SEO is predominantly dead, we have to find other
ways. It has gone from long-tail SEO to best-foot-forward SEO. Whereas longtail
SEO consisted greatly of putting out as much non-overlapping but
keyword-targeted content like I am now to cast both a large and tightly-knit
net, "BFF" SEO consists of a pruning, trimming, revising, editing and
content-promotion. It's the era of polishing turds. Garbage in, eventually
quality out. The question is just whether you expose that vision-and-revision
process to the public or not. Also, when you have content that doesn't fit in
the trim, polished sitemap where does it go? Do you publish it at all? Do you
risk bringing down your entire site with content that doesn't immediately make
the user happy?

I should really show what happens to my videos on YouTube due to the YouTube
algorithm over the years.

Welcome to the era of "Best Foot Forward" or BFF SEO. It's quite the opposite
of "Long Tail" SEO, or low-quality niche publishing. No wonder HitTail went
under a couple of years ago. It had a 16-year run then faded, as did the sort
of content that it taught you how to produce. No more leaning into the
algorithm. Implied in "Best Foot Forward" is doing the best you can do, being
true both to yourself and your audience.

Interesting!

I can work with that. It's actually pretty funny since I recently
re-implemented my long-standing but on-and-off again slice & dice publishing
system.

If the principles of long-tail SEO was writing a lot while ensuring adjacent
topical overlap and an outward-spiraling net-knitting, BFF SEO consists mostly
of fewer URLs within a hierarchical site-structure of the fewest but best
topics that publication channel has to offer, then update and promote
relentlessly.

The premise here is that it's better to hold onto a few search results that
produce for you than thousands that don't. 10 pages that produce 10 hits is
better than 100,000 pages that produce no hits. There's just no scraping
together the bottom of the barrel anymore.

Find what works and build on it.

But as opposed to building on it in the old way where you build out a
site-section with article after article, you build a more shallow site
hierarchy that promotes your top-producers to the top of the hierarchy and make
the experiences on each of those pages the best they can be.

- Pipulate Free and Open Source SEO Software
- Levinux... ? Still a tiny virtual server for education, or is it now
  something about WSL and learning Linux on Windows?

Hmmm. Let's jump on that ChatGPT bandwagon. Cut this blog post here and publish
some stand-alone blog pages produced totally by ChatGPT, in complete
contradiction to BFF SEO, haha!
