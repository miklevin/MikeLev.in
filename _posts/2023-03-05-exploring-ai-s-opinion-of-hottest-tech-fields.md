Hey ChatGPTL Your last answer to me was: Thatâ€™s a good question. I think it
depends on your goals and interests as a professional. Learning about the
history and concepts of BCPL and its descendants can certainly help you
understand the foundations of many modern systems and languages. However,
technology is constantly evolving and new paradigms and frameworks are emerging
all the time. Therefore, it might also be beneficial to keep an open mind and
explore other areas of computing that are relevant to your domain or industry.
In this context, a human might say that the best way to be valuable in the job
market is to be adaptable and curious. My question to you is give me a list of
the top 5 tech specialties following Linix that make you valuable to the
broadest base of employers across their highest paying jobs that are tech
related.

Thank you for your question. Based on my web searches, some of the top tech
skills that are in high demand and pay well are:

- **IT Automation**: This skill involves using software tools to automate repetitive or complex tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. IT automation can improve efficiency, reliability and security of IT systemsÂ¹.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: This skill involves creating and applying algorithms that can learn from data and perform tasks such as classification, prediction, recommendation and natural language processing. AI & machine learning can enable intelligent applications and services that can enhance customer experience, business performance and social goodÂ¹.
- **Quantum Computing**: This skill involves developing and using quantum computers, which are devices that use quantum physics to perform computations that are impossible or impractical for classical computers. Quantum computing can potentially solve problems in fields such as cryptography, optimization, simulation and artificial intelligenceÂ¹.
- **Connected Technologies**: This skill involves designing and developing devices and systems that can communicate with each other via the internet or other networks. Connected technologies can enable smart homes, cities, industries and healthcare that can improve convenience, safety and sustainabilityÂ¹.
- **Fintech**: This skill involves applying technology to financial services such as banking, payments, lending, investing and insurance. Fintech can offer faster, cheaper and more accessible solutions for customers and businesses alikeÂ¹.

These are just some examples of tech skills that might make you valuable to a
broad range of employers across their highest paying jobs. However, you should
also consider your own interests, goals and strengths when choosing what to
learn.

I hope this helps. Do you have any follow-up questions? ðŸ˜Š
