Hello World! I'm Mike Levin. I'm an SEO who hasn't done much SEO for myself in
ages. In the early days before Google got so smart (before RankBrain), I could
do almost any page to the top of search results, given the targeted keywords
were anything but the most competitive (and fortified) out there. I was the
master of the long-tail, and even helped coin the phrase long-tail marketing in
the industry. Today, I don't even hold the first position on my own name, much
less any automatic revenue-generating side hustles. It's time to remedy that,
and you can follow along as I do it in this much more competitive landscape.

SEO stands for search engine optimization. I got into the field in the late
1990s when I switched out of graphic design and print production into being a
webmaster. My path led me into New York City as a vice president of a tiny
marketing agency that was looking for some high tech super powers. I provided
it by creating HitTail, Web 2.0 keyword suggestion tool in 2005 that had a
15-year run, finally being shut down in 2020. It was much longer-lived than
most products from that era. I got a lot of things right. With a little
refactoring, tender love and care it could have had another decade of life
breathed into it juiced with machine learning, for basically the same purpose
as a writing topic suggestion engine. Who knows, with all the AI-writing tools,
it probably could have done the writing too. But that'd have been too spammy.

So why didn't I nurture HitTail and upgrade it to the modern world? I was only
offered 10% ownership which is fair as it was work-for-hire, but my heart
wasn't in it anymore. Also I got married and had a kid and had other
priorities. My life sort of went crazy as I bought a half-million dollar
apartment NYC apartment at which time members of my family went on a needless
war with the neighbors. Life at home went downhill and I couldn't focus at
work. This was unacceptable in NYC marketing agency life where you're always-on
and always need your A-game to stay competitive with the millennial youngin's
flooding the job market. Meanwhile, the old world of Microsoft Active Server
Page (.asp) on which HitTail was built was going away and the new breed of
"full-stack" webdev based on JavaScript libraries, jquery and bootstrap at the
time, were repulsive to me. Node was just appearing on the scene.

Since then, it's just been one JavaScript framework after another. It is a mean
landscape. Early on one of the most complete and over-engineered entries in the
ring was Google's Angular framework, typically used with MongoDB, Express.js,
AngularJS and Node.js (MEAN). Ugh! I couldn't see myself going from Microsoft's
IIS, SQL Server and VBScript to another stack with a steep learning curve and
short shelf-life. I was right to wait because Soon Facebook threw ReactJS into
the ring, which was slightly less mean, but not much. Code generators vomit up
tons of scaffolding reminiscent of how Ruby on Rails works, another web
framework I tried and hated. JavaScript, and to a lesser degree Ruby, are just
not my vibe. Over the years I must have tried taking up Ruby twice and JS five
or six times. Every time I back off saying "not for me".

That took us from coming out of college with in 1992 with a graphic design
degree from Drexel University through the rise of the Web around 1996 and
repositioning as a webmaster doing Microsoft .asp web development, being in NYC
having developed HitTail in NYC by 2005. I met my soon-to-be wife in 2006, got
married and my professional life started going downhill. My skills were very
last-era and I was on the hamster-wheel rat-race of NYC marketing which I hated
almost as much as the JavaScript frameworks I was going to have to learn to
stay modern.

In thin double-crunch-crisis I realized how deeply damaging wrong moves could
be at this time. I had images of flipping burgers in my 50s, unable to support
my soon-to-be-born child. I saw my dad go through such a decline. He did not
have the benefit of Google and the Internet. I think it would have done him
good.  His research turned up

My dad ended up obsolete in his own field as a textile quality assurance
engineer, was forced to switch businesses in his late 50s, bought a check
cashing store, died from diabetes and heart failure, dumped the place on me
where I almost got killed by a robber. I considered myself lucky to even get
back into tech after that, you know as opposed to dead. At 40 with a kid on the
way the way with my marriage and career going downhill, I was terrified of
going obsolete in my own field just like my dad. So I made a study of it with a
fool-me-once won't get fooled again attitude. I was 40. It was 2010. I was
losing altitude, terrified and motivated.
