I also try to stay mindful of the 80/20-rule and Rabbit-Hole evaluations, and pay attention to any poetry that comes to mind. Quasi Joe D'Ohhh is a reminder to stay vigilant and not be fooled twice.

## My Daily 3-Rules

Take your 3 daily rules to heart:

- What's most broken?
- Where do you get the biggest bang for the buck?
- What plates need to be spun?

All modified by the 80/20-rule and Rabbit-Hole evaluations

And stay tuned-in to poetry that just pops into your mind. It's trying to tell
yo something.
