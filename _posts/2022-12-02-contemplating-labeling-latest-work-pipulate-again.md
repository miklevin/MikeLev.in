title: Contemplating Labeling Latest Work Pipulate Again
headline: Considering Changes to My Workflow and Pipulate Labeling for Latest Project
description: I'm considering labeling my latest work as Pipulate and adding an 'automount' option to my DrinkMe Linux install script. My YouTube video on the truth about systemd under WSL2 is gaining traction and I'm contemplating a workflow change, capturing ideas and forging source as Docker becomes more popular. Come read my blog post to learn more about my journey and the decisions I'm making.

Don't forget, I may need to bring back:

    [automount]
    options = "metadata"

...in my DrinkMe Linux install script. I have some symptoms that might be
attributable to that, but I'm not sure.

That video I made on the truth about systemd under WSL2 is gaining some
traction, as far as my YouTube numbers go.

It's becoming increasingly clear what I should be doing with DrinkMe Linux.

Okay, there's a workflow change coming up.

The time has come to connect dots.

Remember Pipulate? Yeah, well there's a made-up word with a great logo and
really spot-on with the Free and Open Source SEO tagline. Where's that image?

Capture some friggn' iron is hot ideas and bang that steel. It's time to forge
some source. And with the Docker infatuation going on, my message is going to
be refreshing simplicity for the right audience. Feel free to tightly couple
monolithic apps. You're the god admin on a box with one generic computing unit
of resources, probably with a net connection and a little bit of storage.

Now, what are you going to do? It's a bit Raspberry Pi-ish of a feeling.
There's plenty of names for it, from an Intel Nuc to a basic Amazon EC2
instance. You see it reflected in a WSL distro or an ISO or LXC or VDMK or what
have you. It's usually an x86 type hardware, but sometimes ARM. Usually 64 bit.
Probably with an IPv4 and IPv6 address.

Achieving compound returns over time from your technical skills improving is
hard to do. This is because compounding returns often comes from developing
muscle memory so you stop thinking about the less automate-able parts of a
task, then almost never having to think about them again.

That's how crawling, walking, speaking, riding a bike and driving work. In
generalized disciplines based on craft, that's how tools work. Like there's a
fairly standard toolbox in carpentry. Hammers and saws don't change that much.
And the surgeon has their scalpel. Bruce Lee had his nunchucks. You get the
idea. We can master and internalize tools because they don't change a great
deal over time.

Along comes object oriented. Along comes concurrency (longer ago than you think
/ VAX & Erlang). When change happens, everyone must go flocking like the
flocking flock, right?
