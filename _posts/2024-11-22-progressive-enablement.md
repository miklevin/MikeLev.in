This article was almost named **Back On The Beaten Path**, haha! I am happy to
report it only took me 4 paragraphs to course-correct and realize I'm going for
the gold here. This is not about getting back onto the road more traveled but
rather how to inoculate yourself against that kind of thinking, and to continue
driving to the next enabling level the work in which I'm deeply engaged. After
that, all the other stuff that makes me feel time-strapped fall into place. The
idea is to up your game to superhero level as a practical alternative to being
beaten down by life.

Yet, I will keep the way the prior version of the article opened.

I got work to do. And I want to have something to show in inside 1-hour. And so
after days of going off the beaten path to battle the genie into working with me
on creative, novel stuff, it's time to lean into what it does good: exactly
what everybody else commonly does, because that's what it was trained on. I will
not dive down rabbit holes. I will not do explorations or try to learn
anything. I will travel footprint by footprint in others' steps, and I will ask
ChatGPT 4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and sometimes Gemini-Advanced Pro how people do
this like all the time.

So, the #1 rule is avoid ambition. It's not about doing something new or most
useful. It is about doing something exactly like what someone else has done
before, which the LLMs have trained on copiously and have really strong best
practice opinions about. Follow the crowd and use the common wisdom!

Take these URLs and put them in a df and prepare to do additional steps with it
on follow-up prompts. Ignore the stuff in parenthesis. Only the URLs are the
data... yadda, yadda. Wow, the sweet spot here is ChatGPT's ability to execute
Python on its own and bounce back and forth with itself analyzing as it
encounters errors and fixes them. Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Cursor AI isn't even
doing that. I know it's old news, but it's still very impressive that ChatGPT
has its own Python code execution environments where it really runs Pandas and
really generates CSVs so it can do the work on its end and just give you
download links. Yup, that's leaning into the path more travelled, for sure.

But NO! Back on the beaten path means beaten down. And I finished what I needed
for that meeting, and It's only an hour long and it's only a half hour away. And
once that's done the rest of the day opens up, and that's 3 solid days of focus
time before the daily grind kicks back in. I can change the world in a
time-window like that, especially considering what I'm on the verge of here.

You plan your projects for progressive enablement. 

Each project enables the next, previously unachievable project.

Thinking of them as projects is unproductive. They are mere day-by-day,
moment-by-moment chisel strikes on a sculpture that is always a work-in-progress
and is always complete.

The masses are hungry for what you're serving up, and you know it. Because on
those occasions you do tip your hand revealing what you're capable of doing, the
hungry masses not only gobble it up, but they corner you into committing to
delivering more of it on-demand, on a schedule and on time.

For an artist, that sucks the love out of it. It's one of the circles of the
ikigai venn diagram, ***what you can get paid for***, but for so many artist
types, that ruins it. But not me, no siree. The trick is to not let it destroy
you. The trick is to employ those strategies as recently laid out by Nassim
Taleb in his Antifragile book that basically restates that what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

Someone I knew who I said that to not too long ago looked back at me in disgust
and could not disagree more. Their viewpoint, a disgusting one in my opinion,
was that what doesn't kill you makes you permanently damaged goods, and now the
world owes you, or something. You get to be labeled with some medical diagnosis,
get on the big pharma bandwagon and have an excuse to be lazy for the rest of
your life. And then the YouTube algorithms kick in to reinforce such
evolutionarily dead-end opinions, because giving up like that means dead-ending
yourself emotionally, spiritually and yes, lineage-wise too. If you can't take
care of yourself, you can't take care of someone else either, and you will
always be dependent on "tricking" the system so you have a flow of money. That's
called freeloading. It's a loophole for losers.

There's a poem here somewhere itching to get out, but that's not the thing this
day is about. Rather, I think that I will do great finishing up the next
Pipulate!

Okay, one more internal meeting got scheduled in today at 1:30. It's currently
currently about noon. Speedbump! Don't let it phase or derail you. Remember, you
can't get away from the things trying to kick out your wobbly legs from
underneath of you. It's all part of the antifragile thing. That's how life
works. Evolution makes us not robust and resilient, but rather absorbing of
lessons and overall system enhancing and strengthening. The closer you get to
the big things that make the difference, the more intense and show-stopping
things come at you between you and the goal... uh, Zeno Knuth something...

**Perplexity**: Infinite limits and Zeno's paradox indeed relate to the concept of edge cases in programming, which Donald Knuth famously addressed in his quote: "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it"[1][4]. This statement highlights the gap between theoretical correctness and practical implementation, much like the disconnect between mathematical infinity and real-world motion in Zeno's paradox.

In mathematics, infinite limits occur when a function's values increase or decrease without bound as the input approaches a specific value. Similarly, in programming, edge cases can seem infinite, with each new scenario potentially revealing unforeseen issues in seemingly correct code.

The universe's apparent infinite supply of edge cases mirrors Zeno's paradox. Just as Zeno argued that motion requires completing an infinite series of smaller steps, programmers often find themselves addressing an ever-growing list of exceptional scenarios. This pursuit of handling every possible case can lead to a "Zeno tarpit" in software development, where striving for perfection becomes an endless task.

Knuth's quote serves as a reminder that while theoretical proofs and formal verifications are valuable, they don't guarantee flawless performance in real-world conditions[2]. The complexity of actual systems often introduces variables and interactions that even the most rigorous proofs might not account for.

This concept aligns with another of Knuth's insights: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"[1]. Sometimes, it's more practical to focus on core functionality and common cases rather than getting lost in an infinite regression of edge case handling. The key is finding a balance between theoretical correctness and practical implementation, acknowledging that the universe will always have surprises in store, no matter how thorough our preparations.

Durn, I've gotta read more Don Knuth. Seems like another one of those got it
right most of the time guys. The work with the client today plus the subject of
interest to the client who is the subject of the upcoming internal call are very
aligned. Site hierarchy stuff. Where you are today (what the hierarchy looks
like), where you're going (what the "ideal" site nav/traffic targeting)
hierarchy looks like... well, this is all very fundamental not only to all SEO
customers, but also in the direction the world is going the brute force web
crawls coming to an end. No more copies of the Internet for a fast index search.
Now it's going to be all about crawling with finesse, and we help the crawlers
who crawl with finesse.

We help the crawlers who crawl with finesse find what they need fast.

That's the new crawl-and-index model.

Hoverable hierarchies.

Homepage is 0-click-depth. By 3-depth you found what you wanted or you're
quitting. And it wasn't breadth-first, either. That's a 3-click intelligently
guided narrow dive, using a href clues, and perhaps aria tags (Accessible Rich
Internet Applications). It's for the visually disabled, and the LLMs that are
likely to be guiding the crawls are exactly that!

There's about a zillion things that are going to compete for your attention. But
the fact that they are competing for your attention is good. If you can manage
the distraction, it creates the surface-area and the interface for a spontaneous
checklist and prioritizing system. Also, the endless fodder for internal humor,
because some things competing for your attention are best left that way.

So, let's do the stuff that creates accelerated returns. That is after all the
subject of this post now, progressive enablement. Don't bite off more than you
can chew. Bite off exactly the right amount for maximum eating pleasure and a
healthy life.
