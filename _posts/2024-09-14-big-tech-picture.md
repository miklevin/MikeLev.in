## The Foundations: Early Computing Origins and the Birth of Virtual Machines

### Martin Richards and BCPL: Pioneering Portability and Virtualization

In the mid-1960s, **Martin Richards** (British) from the University of Cambridge was facing a challenge. He needed a language that could run on different hardware platforms to aid in writing compilers and operating systems. To scratch this itch, he developed **BCPL** (Basic Combined Programming Language) in 1966. BCPL was a typeless language that prioritized simplicity and portability.

#### O-code and the Virtual Machine Concept

Richards introduced an innovative solution to achieve portability: **O-code**, an intermediate representation of BCPL programs. BCPL compilers translated source code into O-code, which was then executed by an **O-code interpreter** or compiled into machine code for the target hardware. This approach effectively created a **virtual machine** at the compiler level—a conceptual machine providing a consistent execution environment across different hardware platforms.

This abstraction allowed BCPL programs to be highly portable, as the same O-code could run on any system with an appropriate interpreter.

#### The Legacy of Virtual Machines

The virtual machine concept introduced by Richards set a precedent for future technologies aiming for portability and isolation:
