title: Adding Google Analytics to Github.io Page with Jekyll
headline: Successfully Installing Google Analytics on my Github.io Page with Jekyll
description: I recently installed Google Analytics on my Github.io Page with Jekyll, and I'm so glad I took the time to understand the Liquid system and what was going on underneath. After a few moments of research, I was able to successfully install Google Analytics and now I'm ready to move on to the next step. Read my blog post to find out how I did it!

Hello World... again! This is an exercise in commitment and consistency. I have
a number of small touches to do here. Let's fix the .vimrc! Okay, that should
do it for a start. See how it autowrapped. That's a "hard" line return at 79
characters. Many people... oh I digress. Let's get onto to Google Analytics on
a Github.io Page site. 1, 2, 3... 1?

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="RD3bSZez6kM" %}

Templates! Now I know a bit more about what's going on in the examples I
copy/pasted from. It's all Jekyll Liquid templating language. Actually Liquid
is from Shopify and Jekyll simply uses it... It's just another curly braces
template language like Django's Jinja templates. It's all basically the same
with different nuanced rules. But nuances are all very important and I hate it
when I have another thing like this to learn. Knocks something else out of my
head. Keep tech liability low! That's what we're really doing with the Github
Pages system for publishing vs. say WordPress... ugh!

Okay... No Google Analytics on MikeAtEleven.com, but on MikeLevinSEO.com...

Hmmm. Gotta even make sure I have it installed right on mikelevinseo.com, which
I only did recently. I thought those two codes would be the same...

Let's look at Google Analytics site... so you get to see me fix a mistake on
the site I was trying to copy the example from. It was only a few days. Anyhoo,
I get that same piece of code now but for a new site. Have to add it to GA...

So there's the "before". Let's push our commits and get the "after"

It'll take a few moments. I'll organize the tabs... I still have to do some
SEO. And the next video is going to be REALLY COOL with Jupyter Notebooks.

Okay, that's it. That was the point of this video. I now have GA installed on
MikeAtEleven.com. Very basic. All default settings. But I can always tweak
later. This satisfies the 80/20-rule!

And you see a "template" from the Liquid system under Jekyll under Github
Pages.

So you see how the YouTube embed made me dive deeper into something that I was
originally just using copy/paste examples and verbatim instructions? It's great
to get started and learn "form" but you really have to understand more of
what's going on underneath.

Thanks, and later gators!
