### May The Forth Be With You

Yep, the poetry pops into my head, what I need when I need.

When I jump around between journals, I type :b1 to get back to the first and
most important one, my personal private one. Oh, be 1. Obi Wan. LOL, yep. This
is too good not to share. And you really ***should*** share this kind of shit.
The thinking goes:

- It's easy to edit in vim once it's "in your fingers".
- It's easy to edit lots of files simultaneously in vim.
- Every single file you're editing in vim can be lots of different actual pages
  on the web.
- It is therefore easy to publish lots of pages on the web with daily vim
  editing.
- Precisely which website and page you're editing doesn't really matter when
  you start out in vim since it's easy to copy/paste between them.
- This page for example starts in my private journal, then goes to MikeLev.in.
- The vim keystrokes for popping around between buffers starts to have
  associations.
- Position #1 you get to for example with :b1 which makes me think Obi-Wan.
- Since position 1 is my private journal, Obi-Wan holds lots of private wisdom.

And so now I copy/paste THIS entry over to MikeLev.in, which seems to be for
things like this that are journal-like, publish-able, and don't better belong
in one of the other sites.

I also by the way can leave the original entry in my :b1 journal because it
never gets published and so will never cause duplicate content issues.
