question: I noticed that you mentioned that you use a variety of tools to measure the success of your campaigns. Could you provide more detail about these tools and how they help you measure success?

- Get the groceries.
- Bring up standing desk.
- Get just 1 room Roomba-able
- Throw out as much as possible (prepare for tomorrow's trash day)

Okay, I'm back from grocery shopping and have everything put away and have one
of my "life-saving" blended drinks made. Lots of fiber. Lots of fruit and
vegetables. Various fresh spices thrown in, ginger, blueberries, strawberries,
bananas, spinach, carrots, oranges, oats, flax seed meal, etc.

I was tempted to make a video again, but the purpose of that video is to remind
myself to do this for myself when I need it, and preferably ***before*** when I
actually need it. It's a great way to eat as a baseline. It's the sort of
fruits that Adi like me to have on-hand as well, so its a big win all around.

Listening to Noam Chomsky is quite unsettling and can get you riled up. It's no
wonder Trump calls him a criminal. And Chomsky calls Trump a joke and the best
example of the worst he's talking about. But still Trump hasn't killed as many
as George W. Bush.

I want to help YouTube be better for your mental health. Operation Act
Together! Every little thing gets done. ELTGD. Felt Good. Gotta do more of
that. In very real ways, I have. It's just not what I've "needed" to do for
work. Chalk up the first few weeks at Moz as ramping-up.

I'm doing this ramping up against the backdrop of overcoming a series of
hurdles life threw at me, and I leapt over each. I'm a bit worried about having
little to no savings in life, but also I have no debt. I have choices.

What if I were born right now with what I know? How would I go about things if
I were just getting started. You've never lost so much if you never had so much
in the first place. I have that going for me.

Unfortunately the places where I have stuff going for me isn't the mundane
everyday chores of life. I hate those little housework chores. I guess that's
one of the things the materially rich get. They have people to clean up after
their messes, so they can be messy.

So we of no cleaning people have more onus ourselves to clean up after
ourselves. Often there can be partners in life who tag-team and break up the
tasks depending on who is better at what. I never had that. I struck out
multiple times on the relationship thing, and now a few marriages in, I know
the kind of traits I would be looking for in the future. The term "better half"
makes sense to me now. Never had one.

Okay, so if everything falls on me from housekeeping to making the money,
effectively for three households now, then I need to get smarter. I need to get
smarter and make better decisions for the benefit of my health.

Be a good example for your kid. Marshal your resources.

There are opposing sides. I imagine them as something like angels betting on a
site like longbets about aspects of life, intelligence, humanity and existence. 

The Universe produces intelligence. It has produced a variety of types of
intelligence, including the considerably different one that is humanity. As it
looks right now, the Universe is on the verge of producing its second type of
intelligence, and it's going to be made by humans, like art or artifacts. That
prefix "art" simply means made by humans.

And as it happens, humans are making the machines and the initial conditions
(software) for the machines to learn. Few doubt that machines learn, and so the
term "machine learning" became quite popular, and the term AI was relegated to
the margins of SciFi. But when you look at it critically, it is an accurate
term, at least if you consider that the hardware and software that allowed the
intelligence to emerge was made by humans. But then our human children are AIs
then too.

Anyhow, anything that's bothering you a little bit today is nothing in the big
picture. You're 52 and let's say you live to 100. That's 48 years. Let's say
I'll have enough health and energy to stay engaged and do interesting stuff up
to 82 years old, that's still 30 years.

Say the first thing that's bet on is how many years, insofar as time exists
that a human, or really any life form, is going to last in a distinctly
identifiable form. The bets would be made by the angel-analogues on all forms
of life. It's just the most juicy action would be on humans.

This will be a weekend where Adi will see me in bounce-back healing mode. In
the angel-analogue betting, I envision those who align this way and that trying
to reach into our world and influence things to win their bets. Such influence
can either work for or against us. Concepts like guardian angels probably arise
from such primal suspicions.

As a SciFi fan, I'd imagine these angel analogues as much like the Jeraptha in
Expeditionary Force. It's interesting that Copilot's pop culture knowledge is
centered around TV and Movies where the Internet culture and reviews are most
abundant, and not on those sources of data like books that are
paywall-protected. It wouldn't know ExForce, but it was suggesting Q from Star
Trek out the wazoo. Q is betting on all of humanity in a sense with that trial
thing, but the Jeraptha bet on every little thing they can. Their culture is
based on it. 

Okay, the Roomba is actually running in one of my rooms. The very thing I
envisioned, I'm doing already. And that's after grocery shopping and giving
myself a super-big dose of the blended elixir.

Keep tension in the machinery.

Okay, I experimentally added an "ask me a question based on this content that
will be at this page" query to OpenAI upon publishing.

Okay, this post shall receive the title "Operation Act Together", a double
entendre. Let's see what happens.
