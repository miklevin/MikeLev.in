## Change is in the Air

Often times I start out these daily tech journal entries with a topic that
evolves during the course of the day, and I end up renaming it to a better
topic. Today, I simply name it "change". Maybe it's a reminder to me to change
the topic before publishing, but also it seems like an apt simple topic.

Change is in the air, from the new old president that just took office, to the
scuttlebutt about the DeepSeek r1 (v3) models, reducing the uniqueness of
OpenAI's offerings and dumping much of it into free and open source. Nvidia is
releasing their DGX Mini Petaflops computer that shows off Jenson's Law: It
takes 100 months to get equal AI performance for 1/25th of the cost. Also,
Google just made scraping their search results much more difficult and costly by
requiring the execution of JavaScript.

## The Data Training Debate

Elon Musk is echoing Ilya Sutskever's assertion that we've run out of data to
train the models on, but that's disingenuous as hell given most of the data on
the Web is on the invisible web, requiring the execution of JavaScript, which
almost nobody's large-scale crawlers but Google's does, giving Google a huge
advantage on access to new data for training models. And that's not even taking
into account that they're not supposed to be letting their models train on
copyrighted data in the first place. The words "we've achieved peak data and
there will be no more" is such a weak position. I don't think Google feels that
way.

## Operation Stargate and Infrastructure Investments

Ahh, Google... who was left out of the just announced Operation Stargate, a 500
billion dollar project announced by Trump, Oracle's Larry Ellison, Softbank's
Masayoshi Son and OpenAI's Sam Altman. An AI infrastructure company, they call
it. Google already has their AI infrastructure, and Elon Musk just built out
his. So those who didn't yet make the big datacenter investments band together
and jump on this bandwagon. Sure, we're in an AI hype cycle. But it's not a hype
cycle that's going to piddle out. It's more akin to the hype cycle that was near
the beginning of computers themselves.

OpenAI needs new hardware. Currently Microsoft's Azure cloud is the exclusive
infrastructure host to ChatGPT and all OpenAI's products. But Microsoft hired
Mustafa Suleyman and absorbed most of Inflection AI's talent with a
soft-acquisition. And so Sam Altman goes to the soft bank... Uh, I mean Softbank
for the money and to another oracle of datacenter hardware... uh, I mean Oracle.
And together you have hardware, software and money to open a star-gate... uh, I
mean Stargate. It's all so very poetic and transparent. Those big ol' hardware
datacenter moats of Amazon, Google and Microsoft (and most recently, Musk) are
gradually evaporating away, courtesy of Trump. Fascinating!

## The Human Element in AI Innovation

Just because the tools are becoming amazing doesn't infuse us with the ability
to use them in brilliant new ways. Quite the opposite, it shines the light on
the fact that we have a follow-the-leader mentality and a general lack of
creativity. We are going to do the same old things we always did, just now
AI-assisted. Stamping templated things out is a lot easier, because that's
exactly the kind of continuation of old patterns AIs do well. But go off the
beaten track and try to do something novel and creative, and you suddenly go to
war with your AI coding assistant who tries to herd you back to how it's
flocking done.

## The Value of Human Context

If there's competitive advantage to be had off the beaten track, help isn't
coming from an AI. It's coming from the same novel, unexpected place deep inside
yourself as this kind of stuff has always come from. You are scratching an itch
that maybe others feel, but only you have taken the initiative to articulate and
reach. It's all about the very context that the AIs are without. They just
wouldn't be able to imagine doing something in a creative novel new way if
someone weren't already out there training them on how to think exactly that
way, and apply that sort of thinking to exactly your situation — at least
in the current state of affairs.

So, the humans add the unique, novel new context. The very things the AIs lack
is the thing that escalates in value. Most humans will by virtue of human nature
follow the more traveled path, take the easy rode, and enjoy the AI templated
road, making them feel smart and productive stamping out new instances of the
same old apps. Very few humans, the outliers, will realize how much opportunity
this flock mentality is opening up for new thinking. But if you bring that novel
new context to the picture, add the new thinking and sensible ways of tackling
problems, new value is created. 

## The Challenge of Agentic Frameworks

All the talk is about agents and agentic frameworks. Agentic implies agency, and
that implies you have the LLMs doing stuff on their own in a sort of
self-prompting way. But there's so much here that jumps over what I think is the
essential point: doing one thing well! Doing one thing well is the precursor to
everything else, because if you can't at least do one thing well according to as
mostly a rote procedure as possible, how are you going to have an agentic swarm
of things doing lots of things well simultaneously and unattended? I know the
YouTube videos tell stories like that's already yesterday's news, but I don't
buy it. It's a formula for exploding complexity and unintended consequences.

## The Path Forward

So, how do you rein it in? How do you do one thing well? Well, that's the
workflow pipeline stuff I've been going on about. I have to really show it soon.
Without producing videos on the finished result, it's just meaningless blog
posts to everyone but the LLMs, mostly indecipherable. Making it decipherable is
part of the point. That's exactly the vector embedding and similarity search
capability that's fueling so much of the AI revolution. So I'm making the fodder
by documenting the process of making a system, which in itself should be able to
make sense of the fodder that was produced in making the system. Very meta.

## The Race for Intelligence

I have to get to that part of the project sooner rather than later. The world is
in this new race, figuring out how to use all this intelligence. There's one
game being played to make more big scalable blobs of this intelligence and
bringing them to bear on classes of problems like protein folding and miracle
materials. That's above my pay-grade. But there's this other race as all these
various models trickle down on us like DeepSeek r1 did recently, and that race
is a sheer creativity-to-productivity context.

## The Bottleneck of Ideas

Distillation of ideas is the bottleneck for me. Gathering up, sorting,
organizing and clarifying my ideas is the bottleneck. And it's so related to the
field of SEO that I'm in and the needs of my clients. It's the same recurring
story. In the case of clients for SEO, it often goes like:

## The Disintermediation Challenge

We have something to sell, and we would like for people to buy it from us first
— usually, online. And often in a battle against the original manufacturers
who are now realizing they can sell directly just as easily, especially with
services like Shopify, and cut out the middleman. The term is disintermediation,
and it has been in full-swing for awhile. It hasn't been more popular or
discussed because of the existence of the opposite, mega-intermediators like
Amazon and Temu. It's niche sellers who are not on the Amazon or Temu platforms
who are at the mercy of the Shopify infrastructure providers of the world who
are in trouble.

That's today's landscape. And I have to figure out how to make the situation of
those types of companies in less trouble.

## Survival Between Giants

Is it possible to survive squeezed between Amazon and the manufacturers trying
to sell direct. Quite how dire is that situation? Is the writing on the wall for
these types of companies? If no, then why? Added value of some sort? Intangibles
that can't just be fulfilled through a hard-goods distribution infrastructure?
Experiences? Emotional stuff? Yeah, for sure. Added value.

But what value? Well, it certainly somehow starts with an organization job far
beyond anything Amazon itself would be able to carry out within a niche. It will
have to be something that requires the domain expertise of someone in that space
to help with the organization.

## The Customer Experience Factor

Why do I feel this way? Well, what do people want when they're looking to buy
something? Confidence? Expertise? Experiences of others who have been in similar
situations? The whole reviews and customer experience thing. Amazon does this
well. Google rewards this well. This is the aggregate reviews and star rating
system that shows up in SERPs. Oh, there's also the Google Merchant Center
ruling the landscape right now. How deeply do I go into that here? The explicit
and often proprietary data-feeds versus the structured data embedded into the
non-proprietary websites? What are those formats again?

**Perplexity**: Structured data for product reviews and availability can be implemented in multiple formats, not just JSON-LD. While JSON-LD is the recommended and most commonly used format, there are other options available[1][4][7]:

1. JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data): This is Google's recommended format due to its ease of implementation and maintenance[4]. It's flexible and can handle complex, nested structured data[3].

2. Microdata: An older format that embeds structured data directly within HTML elements[1][4].

3. RDFa (Resource Description Framework in Attributes): Another format that can be used to embed structured data in HTML[4].

While all three formats are accepted for schema markup, JSON-LD has several advantages:

- It's easier to implement and maintain, especially for complex data structures[3].
- It's not restricted by the content and structure of the HTML, offering greater flexibility[3].
- It's endorsed by Google and other major search engines for its readability by both machines and humans[3].

However, JSON-LD does have some drawbacks:

- It can have a steeper learning curve, especially for those unfamiliar with JSON or linked data concepts[3].
- Implementing JSON-LD may require more technical expertise compared to Microdata or RDFa[3].

Regardless of the format chosen, the structured data helps search engines better understand and display the content of a website, potentially improving visibility in search results[1][7].

## HTML vs JavaScript Implementation

And those formats should be in the actual view-source HTML of the page and not
added with JavaScript. I mean, they technically ***can*** be added with
JavaScript, but then Google or whatever other crawler/bot/search engine needs to
be able to execute the JavaScript which is a lot more resources. It makes it
more expensive to do quick data lookups, which should be trivial.

### Technical Solutions and Tradeoffs

And yet doing this sort of stuff in JavaScript is the main lever to pull for
fast-action on most sites, given the way they're published today. There's
technical solutions for this, like pre-rendering the JavaScript to HTML for the
bots (and only bots) so that they don't have to render it themselves. But this
often takes a lot of setup, configuration, and isn't the cheapest solution in
the world. Baking it into the publishing system itself is often best, but most
Shopify customers (for example) are on the standard solution. What's that
language they use for it again?

**Perplexity**: ### Shopify Headless vs. Non-Headless: Overview and Terminology

**Headless Shopify** refers to a decoupled architecture where the front-end (user interface) is separated from the back-end (e-commerce functionality). The front-end communicates with Shopify's backend via APIs, such as the Storefront API, allowing businesses to build fully customized user experiences using modern technologies like React, GatsbyJS, or NextJS. Shopify provides tools like **Hydrogen** (a React-based framework) and **Oxygen** (a hosting solution) to support headless development[1][2][4].

**Non-Headless Shopify**, often called "traditional Shopify," uses a monolithic structure where the front-end and back-end are tightly integrated. Merchants rely on pre-designed themes and Shopify’s built-in theme editor for customization. This approach is simpler and more user-friendly, with features like drag-and-drop editing and app integrations readily available[1][5][9].

### Key Terminology
- **Headless Commerce**: Decoupling the front-end from the back-end for flexibility in design and functionality.
- **Hydrogen and Oxygen**: Shopify's headless development stack for building and hosting custom storefronts.
- **Storefront API**: The API layer connecting the custom front-end to Shopify's back-end services.

### Advantages and Challenges of Each Approach

#### **Headless Shopify**
**Advantages:**
1. **Customization**: Full creative control over the user interface, enabling unique designs and advanced features[1][8].
2. **Performance**: Faster page load times since heavy backend processes are decoupled from the front-end[4][8].
3. **Omnichannel Experience**: Supports multiple front-ends (e.g., websites, apps, kiosks) connected to a single backend[4][7].
4. **SEO Optimization**: Enhanced control over SEO elements like navigation, rendering, and rich snippets[4].

**Challenges:**
1. **Complexity**: Requires significant development expertise to build and maintain[3][8].
2. **Higher Costs**: Initial setup is expensive due to custom coding and ongoing developer involvement[3][8].
3. **Loss of Built-In Features**: Lacks access to Shopify’s theme editor, plugins, and some customer account functionalities[3][8].
4. **Integration Effort**: Requires more effort to integrate third-party apps compared to traditional Shopify setups[8].

#### **Non-Headless Shopify**
**Advantages:**
1. **Ease of Use**: No coding required; merchants can use pre-designed themes with drag-and-drop customization[1][9].
2. **Cost-Effective**: Lower initial setup costs as it doesn’t require custom development[9].
3. **Built-In Features**: Access to Shopify’s extensive app marketplace and built-in tools for managing customer accounts, payments, etc.[3][9].

**Challenges:**
1. **Limited Customization**: Restricted by Shopify’s themes and templates; harder to create unique user experiences[4][9].
2. **Performance Issues**: Heavy reliance on third-party apps can lead to slower loading times compared to headless setups[4].

### Conclusion
The choice between headless and non-headless Shopify depends on your business needs:
- Opt for **headless Shopify** if you prioritize customization, performance, and omnichannel capabilities.
- Stick with **non-headless Shopify** if simplicity, cost savings, and ease of use are more important.

## Getting Started

Okay yeah. Here we go. I'm getting into the right mindset for the work ahead of
me.

### Finding the Path Forward

I don't know the precise path yet. But I have some broad strokes. And it's a
very similar picture for a lot of clients these days, being squeezed between
Amazon and the manufacturers, with a uniquely Shopify-flavored twist in the
middle. Yup.

### The Shopify Opportunity 

Becoming a Shopify expert could go a long way to helping these types of clients.

And I need to continue that type of thinking.

### Personal Goals

I should start measuring myself again on how much thought-work like this I get
done, ere even the workday begins!
