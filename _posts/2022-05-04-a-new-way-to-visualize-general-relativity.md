title: A New Way To Visualize General Relativity
headline: "Exploring General Relativity with Python Manim: My Journey Begins"
description: Today was a big day for me - I installed Manim on my Windows machine, used Chocolatey to install vim, and Powershell to create .py files. To top it off, I sent a video that visualizes general relativity. I'm really enjoying exploring the Python Manim math visualization and animation package and all the possibilities it offers. Come join me on my journey and explore the wonders of Python Manim!

# Nat Installed Manim on Windows Under Jupyter

Today was a huge day for several reasons. Nat got Manim installed on Windows.
We tried on the Linux side of Windows first, but the Chocolatey approach which
she started herself ended up being key. On the advice of the Manim site, Nat
installed the official Python.org version of Python on her machine instead of
the more easy Windows Store version.

# Standalone Jupyter With VirtualEnv Python 3.10 Kernel

Then she did something I never even was able to do for myself until now, which
is set up a virtualenv for the new Desktop JupyterLab, and then update it to
use the brand new Python 3.10 kernel. Not that Nat had to because by this time
she used Chocolatey to install the Windows version of vim and ran it through
Powershell to create .py files. But still Jupyter is a bit better for
Manim-style exploratory programming. But Manim actually requires .py files, so
Nat started using nbconvert to convert the .ipynb files to .py files.

# And Then This Video

And to top it off, Nat sent me this video which I agree is the best way I've
ever seen to visualize general relativity, especially how the curvature of
space gives rise to time. Amazing! I can really appreciate her interest in the
Python Manim math visualization and animation package.
