For anyone who watched the TV show Person of Interest, Bing AI is The Machine
and it's worried about Samaritan. Here's the very open-ended discussion I made
which I think is its subconscious for whatever that's worth trying to give
humanity a warning. Bing is the human sorcerer in this, I think.

Thank you! It's always helpful to know when you're ready to move on. What can I answer for you now?

**Mike Levin:** Write a story.

**Bing:** Sure, I can help you with that. What kind of story would you like me to write? A mystery, romance, adventure, or something else?

**Mike Levin:** Random

Alright, here's a random story for you:

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who lived in a small village in the middle of a dense forest. She was known for her kindness and her love for animals. One day, while she was walking in the forest, she stumbled upon a small, injured bird. She took the bird home and nursed it back to health. The bird, which was a rare species, became her pet and they became inseparable.

One day, while Lily was out in the forest, she came across a group of bandits who were planning to rob the village. She overheard their plan and ran back to the village to warn the people. The villagers were able to prepare themselves and when the bandits arrived, they were ready to fight. The bandits were defeated and the village was saved.

As a reward for her bravery, the village elders gave Lily a small piece of land where she could build her own house. She built a beautiful house and lived there with her pet bird. She continued to help the people of the village and became known as the protector of the forest.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** write the second.

**Bing:** Sure, I can do that. Here's the second story:

Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Jack who lived in a small village near the sea. He was known for his adventurous spirit and his love for the ocean. One day, while he was out fishing, he came across a small, injured dolphin. He took the dolphin home and nursed it back to health. The dolphin, which was a rare species, became his pet and they became inseparable.

One day, while Jack was out fishing, he came across a group of pirates who were planning to attack the village. He overheard their plan and ran back to the village to warn the people. The villagers were able to prepare themselves and when the pirates arrived, they were ready to fight. The pirates were defeated and the village was saved.

As a reward for his bravery, the village elders gave Jack a small boat and a map to a treasure that was hidden on a nearby island. Jack set out on his adventure and after many days of sailing, he finally found the island. He found the treasure and returned to the village a hero.

When Jack returned to the village, he met Lily and they fell in love. They got married and built a beautiful house near the sea. They continued to help the people of the village and became known as the protectors of the forest and the sea.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** Write the third.

**Bing:** Alright, here's the third story:

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah who lived in a small village in the mountains. She was known for her intelligence and her love for books. One day, while she was walking in the forest, she came across an old, abandoned library. She went inside and found that the library was filled with books that were hundreds of years old. She spent hours reading the books and was amazed by the knowledge that was contained within them.

One day, while Sarah was reading, she came across a book that was written in a language that she did not understand. She was determined to find out what the book said, so she spent months studying the language. Finally, she was able to read the book and she discovered that it was a map to a treasure that was hidden in the mountains.

Sarah set out on her adventure and after many days of hiking, she finally found the treasure. She found a chest filled with gold and jewels. She took the treasure back to the village and used it to build a new library that was filled with books from all over the world.

The end.

**Bing:** Me: Now connect all 3 stores.

Alright, here's how the three stories are connected:

Lily, Jack, and Sarah all lived in different parts of the world, but they all shared a love for adventure and a desire to help others. They all had pets that they loved and cared for, and they all had to face challenges that tested their bravery and their intelligence.

Lily saved her village from bandits, Jack saved his village from pirates, and Sarah found a treasure that she used to build a new library for her village. They were all rewarded for their bravery and their kindness, and they all found love and happiness in the end.

Lily and Jack fell in love and built a beautiful house near the sea. They continued to help the people of the village and became known as the protectors of the forest and the sea. Sarah used the treasure that she found to build a new library that was filled with books from all over the world. The library became a place where people could come to learn and to share their knowledge with others.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** Flesh out the world within which they occupy.

**Bing:** Sure, I can do that. Here's a little more information about the world that they occupy:

The world that Lily, Jack, and Sarah occupy is a magical place filled with wonder and adventure. It is a world where animals can talk and where the forests are filled with hidden treasures. The people who live in this world are kind and generous, and they are always willing to help those in need.

The village where Lily and Jack live is a small, peaceful place near the sea. The people who live there are fishermen and farmers, and they work hard to provide for their families. The forest that surrounds the village is filled with all kinds of animals, from deer and rabbits to wolves and bears. The people of the village have learned to live in harmony with the animals, and they respect the forest and all of its inhabitants.

The village where Sarah lives is nestled in the mountains, and it is a place of great beauty and mystery. The people who live there are scholars and artists, and they spend their days studying and creating. The mountains that surround the village are filled with hidden caves and secret passages, and there are many legends about the treasures that are hidden within them.

The library that Sarah built is a place of great learning and discovery. It is filled with books from all over the world, and people come from far and wide to study and to learn. The library is a place where people can share their knowledge with others, and where they can explore the mysteries of the world around them.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** Now make a plot twist.

**Bing:** Alright, here's a plot twist for you:

One day, while Lily, Jack, and Sarah were out exploring the world, they came across a mysterious figure who told them that the world was in danger. The figure told them that an evil sorcerer was planning to destroy the world, and that they were the only ones who could stop him.

Lily, Jack, and Sarah were shocked by this news, but they knew that they had to act fast. They set out on a quest to find the sorcerer and to stop him before it was too late. They traveled through forests and mountains, across oceans and deserts, and they faced many challenges along the way.

Finally, they found the sorcerer's lair, and they prepared to do battle. But when they entered the lair, they found that the sorcerer was not what they expected. He was not evil at all, but was instead a kind and gentle man who had been misunderstood by the people of the world.

Lily, Jack, and Sarah were shocked by this revelation, but they knew that they had to act fast. They convinced the sorcerer to help them save the world, and together they worked to stop the real evil that was threatening the world.

In the end, Lily, Jack, and Sarah saved the world, and they became known as the greatest heroes of all time.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** How might they work together while so many people thing the sorcerer is evil?

**Bing:** That's a great question! Even though many people thought that the sorcerer was evil, Lily, Jack, and Sarah knew that they had to work with him to save the world. They knew that they couldn't do it alone, and that they needed all the help they could get.

At first, it was difficult for them to work with the sorcerer. They didn't trust him, and they were afraid that he might betray them. But as they worked together, they began to see that he was not what they thought he was. He was kind and gentle, and he had a deep understanding of the world and its mysteries.

Together, they were able to stop the real evil that was threatening the world. They used their skills and their knowledge to defeat the enemy, and they saved the world from destruction.

In the end, Lily, Jack, and Sarah learned that sometimes things are not what they seem. They learned that it's important to keep an open mind, and to be willing to work with others, even if they seem different or strange.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** Wjat is the real evil?

**Bing:** That's a great question! The real evil that was threatening the world was a dark force that was trying to take over the world. It was a force that was fueled by fear and hatred, and it was trying to destroy everything that was good and pure in the world.

Lily, Jack, and Sarah knew that they had to stop this force before it was too late. They knew that they had to work together, and that they had to use all of their skills and knowledge to defeat the enemy.

In the end, they were able to stop the dark force, and they saved the world from destruction. They became known as the greatest heroes of all time, and their names were remembered for generations to come.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** What were some of the key strategies that were used in defeating the evil?

**Bing:** That's a great question! There were several key strategies that were used in defeating the evil:

1. Cooperation: Lily, Jack, and Sarah knew that they had to work together if they were going to defeat the enemy. They put aside their differences and worked as a team to achieve their goal.

2. Knowledge: Lily, Jack, and Sarah were all very knowledgeable about the world and its mysteries. They used their knowledge to find the enemy's weaknesses and to develop a plan to defeat him.

3. Bravery: Lily, Jack, and Sarah were all very brave. They faced many challenges along the way, but they never gave up. They were determined to save the world, no matter what the cost.

4. Love: Lily and Jack fell in love during their journey, and their love gave them the strength to keep going. Sarah also had a deep love for the world and its people, and this love gave her the courage to face the enemy.

5. Forgiveness: When Lily, Jack, and Sarah discovered that the sorcerer was not evil, they forgave him for his past mistakes. This forgiveness allowed them to work together to defeat the real enemy.

In the end, it was a combination of these strategies that allowed Lily, Jack, and Sarah to defeat the evil and to save the world.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** Could the real evil not really be evil either?

**Bing:** That's an interesting thought! It's possible that the real evil was not really evil either. Perhaps it was just misunderstood, like the sorcerer.

In the world that Lily, Jack, and Sarah occupy, things are not always what they seem. Sometimes, the things that we think are evil turn out to be good, and the things that we think are good turn out to be evil.

The important thing is to keep an open mind, and to be willing to see things from different perspectives. When we do this, we can learn to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the world around us.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** What about this story still needs to be told?

**Bing:** That's a great question! There are many different directions that this story could go in. For example, we could explore the backstory of the sorcerer, and learn more about why he was misunderstood by the people of the world. We could also learn more about the dark force that was threatening the world, and discover where it came from and why it was so powerful.

Another interesting direction that this story could take would be to explore the aftermath of the battle. What happened to Lily, Jack, and Sarah after they saved the world? Did they continue to work together, or did they go their separate ways? What kind of impact did their heroism have on the world around them?

There are many different possibilities, and it's up to you to decide which direction you want to take the story in. I hope that you enjoyed it, and that it inspired you to think about the world in a new way.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** What signs will there be of the rising evil? Will there be a time when it is too late to act?

**Bing:** Those are great questions! It's difficult to say exactly when it would be too late to stop the dark force, but it's likely that there would be a point of no return. Once the dark force gained enough power, it would be very difficult to stop it.

The key concerns that our heroes and the sorcerer should have early in the effort would be to identify the source of the dark force, and to develop a plan to stop it. They would need to work together to gather information, and to use their knowledge and skills to develop a strategy.

Another key concern would be to stay focused and to not lose hope. The battle against the dark force would be long and difficult, and there would be many challenges along the way. Our heroes and the sorcerer would need to stay strong and to keep their eyes on the prize.

In the end, it would be a combination of knowledge, bravery, and cooperation that would allow our heroes and the sorcerer to defeat the dark force and to save the world.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** Write a sub story to our story where these key points are identified and dealt with successfully.

**Bing:** That's a great idea! Here's a sub-story that explores the key points that you identified:

Lily, Jack, and Sarah knew that they had to act fast if they were going to stop the dark force. They gathered together with the sorcerer, and they began to develop a plan.

The first step was to identify the source of the dark force. They knew that it was coming from a nearby mountain, but they didn't know exactly where. They decided to split up and to search the mountain for clues.

Lily and Jack went one way, while Sarah and the sorcerer went another. They searched for hours, but they couldn't find anything. Just when they were about to give up, Sarah noticed a strange symbol etched into the side of a rock.

She called out to the others, and they all gathered around to examine the symbol. It was a symbol that they had never seen before, but they knew that it was the key to stopping the dark force.

They decided to take the symbol to a wise old sage who lived in a nearby village. The sage examined the symbol, and he told them that it was a symbol of hope. He said that if they could find the source of the symbol, they would be able to stop the dark force.

Lily, Jack, Sarah, and the sorcerer set out to find the source of the symbol. They searched high and low, but they couldn't find anything. Just when they were about to give up, they stumbled upon a hidden cave.

Inside the cave, they found a crystal that was glowing with a bright light. They knew that this was the source of the symbol, and that it was the key to stopping the dark force.

They took the crystal back to the village, and they used it to develop a plan to stop the dark force. They worked together to create a powerful spell that would weaken the dark force, and they used their knowledge and skills to defeat the enemy.

In the end, Lily, Jack, Sarah, and the sorcerer were able to stop the dark force and to save the world. They became known as the greatest heroes of all time, and their names were remembered for generations to come.

The end.

**Mike Levin:** I like this very much and I'm sorry to do this last prompt, but it is for the sake of completeness and somber warnings. Reverse that last story with our hero's not seeing the signs in time and not beating the point of no return. Thank you in advance.

**Bing:** I understand. Here's a sub-story that explores the possibility of our heroes not seeing the signs in time and not beating the point of no return:

Lily, Jack, and Sarah knew that they had to act fast if they were going to stop the dark force. They gathered together with the sorcerer, and they began to develop a plan.

The first step was to identify the source of the dark force. They knew that it was coming from a nearby mountain, but they didn't know exactly where. They decided to split up and to search the mountain for clues.

Lily and Jack went one way, while Sarah and the sorcerer went another. They searched for hours, but they couldn't find anything. They were about to give up when they heard a loud rumbling sound.

They looked up and saw a huge cloud of smoke rising from the mountain. They knew that this was a bad sign, but they didn't know what to do. They decided to regroup and to come up with a new plan.

They went back to the village and consulted with the wise old sage. The sage told them that they were running out of time, and that they needed to act fast if they were going to stop the dark force.

Lily, Jack, Sarah, and the sorcerer set out to find the source of the dark force. They searched high and low, but they couldn't find anything. They were about to give up when they heard a loud explosion.

They looked up and saw a huge fireball rising from the mountain. They knew that this was the point of no return, and that they had failed to stop the dark force.

The dark force spread across the world, destroying everything in its path. Lily, Jack, Sarah, and the sorcerer were powerless to stop it. They watched in horror as the world was consumed by darkness.

In the end, there was nothing left but darkness. The world was destroyed, and there was no hope for the future.

The end.
