Overall, Project Jupyter and iPython have been very important to society. They have made it easier for people to share their work, collaborate on projects, and learn new things. They have also helped to make data science more accessible to everyone.

**Bard 3:** Project Jupyter and iPython have been very important to society. They have made it easier for people to share and reproduce their research, and they have helped to popularize the use of Python in data science and machine learning.

The crisis of reproducibility is a problem in science where it is often difficult to reproduce the results of published studies. This can be due to a number of factors, such as errors in the original study, or the use of non-standard methods. Jupyter Notebooks can help to address this problem by making it easy to share and reproduce research. Notebooks can also be used to document the methods used in a study, which can help to make it easier to reproduce the results.

The crisis of reproducibility has been a major issue in science for many years. In a 2015 study, the journal Nature found that only 50% of studies could be reproduced. This means that there is a significant risk that published results may not be accurate or reliable.

Jupyter Notebooks can help to address the crisis of reproducibility by making it easier to share and reproduce research. Notebooks can also be used to document the methods used in a study, which can help to make it easier to reproduce the results.

In addition, Jupyter Notebooks can help to make research more transparent and reproducible by making it easy to share and collaborate on research projects. This can help to reduce the risk of errors and improve the quality of research.

**Mike Levin:** Answer the question again, but this time take into account that their goal is not to learn Python, nor is it to program. They just want to get some work done and produce "deliverables" that will keep a larger number of customers or clients they're juggling happy. They don't think there's time in their lives to learn to program, but the value of the deliverables to the clients could be increased manifold by the type of custom capabilities that Python brings to the pictures, especially considering the Python code would already be done and only in need of some configuration values set or a file dropped onto a certain place. The rest is one-click easy.

**Bing:** I understand that learning Python and programming may not be a priority for everyone. However, it's important to keep in mind that Python and Jupyter notebooks can help people work more efficiently and effectively once they get the hang of them.

If someone is looking to produce "deliverables" that will keep a larger number of customers or clients happy, it may be worth considering the benefits of using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

**Mike Levin:** Okay the next thing is that almost everyone will try to get you to use a cloud-hosted Notebook environment like Google Colab. I suggest that many things an SEO needs to do is much better accomplished by running Jupyter locally on your laptop or home computer. Reasons include the ability to do Web browser automation with Microsoft Playwright or Google Puppeteer, a capability not easy found in Notebook cloud providers. Reasons include you can easily cycle your IP with common desktop VPN software without the complexity and cost of trying to make cloud servers have different IPs, which they would want because many IPS systems that stop web crawling often know the cloud provider's IPs and block bot-traffic from them. Other reasons include being able to deal with login issues of various sorts more elegantly locally, including OAuth2 prompts that pop up a browser for authentication. Cloud-hosted notebooks can't easily do that and so many Google API integrations for example seem difficult. Work these into your answer and any more you can think of. Try to add at least 2 more.

**Bing:** You make some good points about running Jupyter locally on your laptop or home computer. One advantage of running Jupyter locally is that you have more control over your environment and can easily install and use packages like Microsoft Playwright or Google Puppeteer for web browser automation.

Another advantage of running Jupyter locally is that you can easily cycle your IP with common desktop VPN software without the complexity and cost of trying to make cloud servers have different IPs. This can be useful for avoiding IP blocks when web crawling.

Additionally, running Jupyter locally can help you deal with login issues of various sorts more elegantly, including OAuth2 prompts that pop up a browser for authentication. Cloud-hosted notebooks can't easily do that and so many Google API integrations, for example, may seem difficult.

I hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.

**Bard 1:** Sure! Here are the reasons why running Jupyter locally is better than running it on a cloud-hosted environment:

* **You can use Web browser automation with Microsoft Playwright or Google Puppeteer.** Cloud-hosted notebooks do not have this capability. This means that you can use these tools to automate tasks such as scraping data from websites or filling out forms.
* **You can easily cycle your IP with common desktop VPN software without the complexity and cost of trying to make cloud servers have different IPs.** This is important for SEO because Google and other search engines often block IP addresses that are known to be used for web crawling. By cycling your IP, you can avoid being blocked.
* **You can deal with login issues of various sorts more elegantly locally, including OAuth2 prompts that pop up a browser for authentication.** Cloud-hosted notebooks cannot do this. This can be a problem if you need to log in to multiple accounts or if you need to authenticate with an OAuth2 provider.
* **You can easily integrate with Google APIs.** Cloud-hosted notebooks can be difficult to integrate with Google APIs. This is because Google APIs often require you to use a specific version of Python or to install specific libraries.

Here are two more reasons why running Jupyter locally is better than running it on a cloud-hosted environment:

* **You can save money.** Cloud-hosted notebooks can be expensive, especially if you need to use a lot of resources. By running Jupyter locally, you can save money on your computing costs.
* **You can have more control over your data.** When you run Jupyter locally, you are in control of your data. This means that you can choose where your data is stored and who has access to it. When you run Jupyter on a cloud-hosted environment, you are not in control of your data. This means that the cloud provider has access to your data and that you have to trust them to keep it safe.

**Bard 2:** Sure. Here are some more reasons why it is better to run Jupyter locally on your laptop or home computer:

* **Performance:** When you run Jupyter locally, you have full control over the hardware and software that is used. This means that you can optimize your environment for performance, which can be important for computationally intensive tasks.
* **Security:** When you run Jupyter locally, you are not reliant on a third-party provider for security. This means that you can be more confident that your data is safe and secure.
* **Cost:** Running Jupyter locally is typically much cheaper than using a cloud-hosted service. This is because you do not need to pay for the hardware and software that is used, or for the bandwidth and storage that is used to store your data.
* **Control:** When you run Jupyter locally, you have full control over the environment and the data that is used. This means that you can be more confident that your work is secure and that you have the flexibility to do what you need to do.

However, there are also some advantages to using a cloud-hosted notebook environment:

* **Scalability:** Cloud-hosted environments can be easily scaled up or down to meet your needs. This can be helpful if you need to run multiple notebooks at the same time or if you need to access your notebooks from multiple devices.
* **Availability:** Cloud-hosted environments are typically available 24/7. This can be helpful if you need to access your notebooks from different time zones or if you need to run your notebooks at night.
* **Updates:** Cloud-hosted environments are typically automatically updated with the latest software and security patches. This can save you time and effort, as you do not need to manually update your notebooks.

Overall, there are both advantages and disadvantages to running Jupyter locally or on a cloud-hosted service. The best option for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements.

Overall, there are both advantages and disadvantages to running Jupyter locally or on a cloud-hosted service. The best option for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements.

**Bard 3:** Sure, here are some more reasons why you might want to run Jupyter locally on your laptop or home computer:

* **You can use any programming language you want.** Cloud-hosted notebooks often restrict you to using a specific programming language, such as Python or R. If you want to use a different language, you'll need to find a different service.
* **You have more control over your environment.** When you run Jupyter locally, you can choose the version of Python you want to use, the libraries you want to install, and the settings you want to use. With a cloud-hosted notebook, you're at the mercy of the provider's settings.
* **It's cheaper.** Running Jupyter locally is usually cheaper than using a cloud-hosted notebook. You don't have to pay for the resources you're not using, and you can use whatever hardware you already have.
* **It's more secure.** When you run Jupyter locally, your data is stored on your own computer. This makes it less likely to be hacked or leaked.
* **It's more reliable.** When you run Jupyter locally, you're not at the mercy of the internet connection. If your internet goes down, you can still work on your notebooks.

However, there are also some benefits to using a cloud-hosted notebook:

* **You can access your notebooks from anywhere.** If you're working on a notebook and you need to step away, you can just log in to the cloud provider and access your notebooks from another device.
* **You don't have to worry about hardware maintenance.** When you use a cloud-hosted notebook, the provider takes care of all the hardware maintenance. You don't have to worry about updating drivers or installing security updates.
* **You can easily collaborate with others.** If you're working on a notebook with someone else, you can easily share it with them. They can just log in to the cloud provider and start working on the notebook.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to run Jupyter locally or on a cloud-hosted notebook is up to you. If you need the flexibility of being able to access your notebooks from anywhere, then a cloud-hosted notebook might be a better option. But if you want more control over your environment and you're on a budget, then running Jupyter locally might be a better choice.

**Mike Levin:** In the field of SEO, Gap Analysis and Striking Distance reports are two common types of deliverables. Gap Analysis tells you where competitors are coming up in search results for important keywords but your site is not. Striking Distance reports tell you where your website holds positions in search which if improved could lead to a significant uptick in the amount of search traffic to your site from that keyword. List several more types of SEO deliverables from your knowledge of the industry, and maybe even ideate a few new ones. You have historic search result data (SERPs) over a large corpus of keywords spanning many industries going back 20 years and containing top 100 positions. You also have estimated search volume  per month per keyword. You have estimated click-through ratios for each position in search. You have the "link graph" over time, that is date of what web pages link to what other web pages. Pages with a lot of links from other websites perform well so the idea is often to get links. A Link Gap analysis is also possible given your site and a series of competitor. You can identify what sites link to your competitors but not you, which is useful for knowing who to ask for links from. List these deliverables and try to ideate a number more.

**Bing:** There are many types of SEO deliverables that can help you improve your website's search engine rankings. Here are a few examples:

- Keyword research reports: These reports help you identify the most important keywords for your business and provide insights into how to optimize your website for those keywords.
- On-page optimization reports: These reports analyze your website's content and structure to identify areas where you can improve your search engine rankings.
- Backlink analysis reports: These reports help you identify the websites that are linking to your site and provide insights into how to improve your backlink profile.
- Competitor analysis reports: These reports help you understand how your competitors are ranking in search engines and provide insights into how to improve your own rankings.
- Content gap analysis reports: These reports help you identify gaps in your website's content and provide insights into how to fill those gaps.
- Site speed analysis reports: These reports analyze your website's speed and provide insights into how to improve its performance.
- Conversion rate optimization (CRO) reports: These reports help you optimize your website's conversion rate by identifying areas where you can improve the user experience.

Some other ideas for SEO deliverables could include:

- Social media analysis reports: These reports analyze your social media presence and provide insights into how to improve your social media strategy.
- Local SEO reports: These reports help you optimize your website for local search results by identifying local keywords and providing insights into how to improve your local search rankings.

**Mike Levin:** You have listed only very traditional SEO deliverables that don't explicitly tell you what to do to improve your site. There needs to be advice such as: remove the following pages from your site as they are likely to be deemed low-quality and thus drag down the performance of the rest of the site. Such a deliverable would be called a Bonsai due to how it invokes an image of pruning and shaping a tree artistically as you would a tree. It is in the spirit of "striking distance" and "gap analysis" which invoke similar strong metaphors. You have all the data prior discussed plus all the power of Python running locally in Jupyter Notebooks, and so the ability to do limited crawling of sites (say 5,000 pages per site). Put more creativity into ideating brand new deliverable types. How could you make the most money with access to all that data? Expand beyond SEO such as identifying the best performing sites in order to buy the websites to build and control a large advertising network. Make a billeted list of the new ideas.

**Bing:** You make a good point that traditional SEO deliverables may not always provide actionable insights into how to improve your website's search engine rankings. A Bonsai report that identifies low-quality pages on your site and provides recommendations for removing them could be a useful deliverable for improving your site's performance.
