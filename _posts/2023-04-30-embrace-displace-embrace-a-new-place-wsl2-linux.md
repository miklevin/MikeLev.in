Have you heard of Microsoft's Embrace & Displace strategy? I'm going to teach
you how to embrace that strategy to find a "new place"... other than Windows,
that is. I call it Embrace a New Place, and it riffs directly off of
Microsoft's profoundly effective Embrace & Displace strategy, particularly in
regard to how they're practicing it today by including all of Linux as a mere
subsystem. Well, that opens the door a crack. I'm going to show you how to
shove your foot into that crack and widen it enough to walk through.

I've got my personal mission which actually helps me have quite an edge. It has
led me to develop the unusual but timeless text editing ability made possible
by vi, vim and now NeoVim. But why do any of this if it's not to improve your
other things? It can't be for its own sake. It's for processing thoughts so
you can do everything else better. So let's dig into that. No more excuses with
refining a dependency.

So how to make "Powerpoint work" love-worthy? It can be, but it's the whole
proprietary tool, both Microsoft and Google Slides, that subconsciously turns
me off. It's like a triggering or anxiety response. It's the futility of the
"manual" work, shoving things around in a WYSIWYG (is that expression still
used?) user interface.

But there is this: https://github.com/googleworkspace/md2googleslides

Who knows how many people there are like me who have something akin to anxiety
the moment "Decks" are mentioned. But markdown? No problem. I'm doing that
naturally without even thinking about it. So let's flesh it out in Markdown.

How does the discussion go?

Windows isn't bad. In fact, from a UI, support, availability on new hardware,
game market, etc., it's the best. Even their hardware is fantastic. But
Microsoft Windows the worst for the things I care about most: the timeless
developer tools. Microsoft knows it too, and that's why they integrated Linux
into (and made it a "subservient" subsystem) Windows. 

It's yet another example of Microsoft's "Embrace and Displace" strategy used so
effectively and well over the years.

- Embrace the Web & Displace Netscape (worked)
- Embrace Java & Displace it with J++ (didn't work)
- Embrace Spreadsheets & Displace Lotus 1-2-3 (worked)
- Embrace Word Processing & Displace WordPerfect (worked)
- Embrace Money & Displace Intuit Quicken (didn't work)
- Embrace the Internet & Displace AOL (worked)
- Embrace the Cloud & Displace AWS (didn't work)
- Embrace Linux & Displace it with WSL2 (working)

The "Web & Internet" entries on this list seem like the biggest. I mean,
basically Microsoft embraced the Internet and then displaced it with their own
version of the Internet. That's pretty big. But it's not the biggest.

The mind might wander to AI as all things do these days, and you can see how
very quickly Microsoft went all-in on OpenAI, and that indeed is a case of
trying to kill competitors early. But that's not what this article is about.

Bigger than the Web & the Internet, but smaller maybe than AI is the embracing
& displacing of Linux, the engine that's powering it all. There's pretty much
nothing that exists in the Web/Internet or AI world that wasn't written and
running on Linux. Linux is the preferred fuel, energy, and power of it all. And
when it's not, it's its precursor Unix and not Windows.

This is why Microsoft had little to no choice but to incorporate Linux into
Windows. 

And now you can be the beneficiary of all this. Doesn't it sound nice to be
able to get the cheapest and best hardware and run a decent enough proprietary
operating system that ***SERVES HOST*** to what's important: Linux?

This argument changes as other laptops catch up with cost and quality, but then
add upgradability, modularity, and repairability such as the Framework Laptop.
But that will take some years (if ever) to mainstream. In the meanwhile, we're
stuck with disposable laptops and we have to make that work to our advantage.

In fact, this is the story of fair turnaround, or turning the tables on
designed and planned obsolescence. 

Feeling down from having your years of investment into a skill or technology
suddenly obsolete by design? You my friend are the victim of planned
obsolescence. While some planned obsolescence is good for both you and business
in how it keeps things moving forward, it's not good when it's done to you
personally and in regard to your ability to earn a living and on tech that
didn't really have to change.

Designed obsolescence for its own sake, or rather for the sake of quarterly
profits at the expense of your ability to earn a living, is a bad and arguably
even evil thing. The good news is that there are measures you can take to
protect yourself from it.

First and foremost is to not tie yourself to the particular tools and habits
that are in turn tied to the particular technology that's being obsoleted. You
invest it tech-A and tech-A is inextricably tied to tech-B and you have to
learn tech-B to earn a living, get your apps into tech-A's app store
marketplace or whatever. Then tech-A changes. You're screwed. Reset button!

Vendors don't mind. The reset button fuels new rounds of buying and upgrading
and retraining and re-certificating. It's a vicious cycle. There's even more
insidious underpinnings here, because they themselves are not set back
similarly internally. ***Their*** tools don't change at the same rate as yours
do, because they're not eating their own dog food. They're not using their own
tools to build their own tools. They're using the timeless stuff from the
Unix/Linux world.

Wait, what? There's timeless tech? Yes, indeed. You need look no farther than
the text editor wars. Text is everything in tech. There's not a technology out
there that isn't at some point represented as text. Beautiful, simple, plain
text. And there's no better way to process text than with a text editor. And if
you look at something called the "text editor wars" you'll see that there's
been a battle going on for decades between the two most popular text editors:
vi and emacs.

This is your first clue of an underlying timeless world of technology. The text
editor war is nearly a half-century battle. Think how fast JavaScript
frameworks are obsoleted. How can something that goes obsolete in a year or two
even be in the same category as things that don't go obsolete in a half-century?

If you ask someone what editor they're using today, you'll basically find a
split between two types of people: those who jump on the latest "power-tool"
fad such as VSCode, PyCharm, Atom, Sublime, XCode, TextMate, EditPlus,
NotePad++, IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans and the like. In this camp, you have to
scrap and relearn basically everything you know every 2 to 5 years, including
your most invaluable skill: your muscle memory.

Imagine if you had to re-learn how to walk, talk and drive every 2 to 5 years.
Same thing. It's an awful, terrible, reprehensible thing about the state of
***popular*** technology today. It's not the same with timeless technology.

The other camp is the camp of the timeless text editors: vi and emacs. These
editors have been around for decades and they're not going anywhere. When one
of the ranks of vi and emacs users switch camps and take up power-tools, they
do so to stay competitive with the younguns who are taking all sorts of "get
rick quick" shortcuts because of proprietary spell-casting plugins. But these
magic spells are perishable. They have expiration dates. And the vi/emacs crowd
can always revert to their timeless tools and still be competitive.

Which camp would you rather be in? Those who are left with imposter syndrome
every time their abilities are wiped out and they are no longer actually as
capable as they used to be, by virtue of their spell-casting platform
disappearing (or at least going out of production)? Or those who are left with
their timeless tools and are still as capable as they ever were?

The answer is obvious. But the problem is that the timeless tools are not
popular. They're not popular because they don't make money for vendors on a
quarterly basis. They are a bit harder to learn, but not much. 

So Microsoft opens the door for you to find and discover and indeed embrace
Linux, such as they did. And when you do, you discover a ***new place***. This
new place is an old place. It's a very old place that is never going away in
tech, even while all the new stuff is coming and going.

If you embrace this new place, you can never be displaced along with the old
stuff going obsolete by design. So embrace that new place. Embrace Linux and
never be displaced. Start learning one of the two old-school text editors,
emacs or vi. Learn your way around the command-line. Learn how to use git.
Learn how to use ssh. Nobody will ever be able to take these skills away from
you. They are timeless. They are the foundation of all information technology.
