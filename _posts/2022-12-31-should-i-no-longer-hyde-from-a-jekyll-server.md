Wow, what an amazing few days, weeks and even months of work. Things are really
poppin'. That is, they're coming more naturally and easy for me. That whole 10
years or 10,000 hours thing only just barely makes the point given the
largeness of the subject-matter you're trying to master.

I do so much Github Pages these days, waiting for the static site to be
generated and using up what I learned to be a finite number of Github Actions.
So let's ask ChatGPT:

## How do you run jekyll on your local linux machine to be like Github pages?

To run Jekyll on your local Linux machine and have it be like GitHub Pages, you
will need to follow these steps:

Install Ruby and the Jekyll gem on your machine:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential
    gem install jekyll bundler

Create a new Jekyll project:

    jekyll new myproject
    cd myproject

Start the Jekyll server:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000 to view your Jekyll
site.

If you want to make changes to your site, you can edit the files in the
myproject directory and the changes will be automatically reflected in the
browser when you refresh the page.

When you are ready to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, you can follow the
instructions at
https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
to set up a new repository for your site and push your code to it. GitHub Pages
will then build and deploy your site automatically.

Okay, keep that in mind. I have a New Years party I'm going to shortly.
