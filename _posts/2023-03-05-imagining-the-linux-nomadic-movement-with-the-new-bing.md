Help me make the argument to take up Python on Linux in particular because of how now that Linux ships with Windows and is easy to get running on Mac and is so much more widely deployed on the back and and is the main thing used for machine learning and AI systems that it's ridiculous now to do anything directly on a proprietary host system such as Windows or Mac. The role of proprietary systems now actually always to host Linux so that the work you do actually have a wide reach and a future, along with the skills you learn how to do it, especially with particular timeless sub-technologies of Linux such as vim, Python and git. While these tools will run on the proprietary native hosts, they "lock you in" and using them on Linux is the only true path to technology freedom. You can explain how GPL helped make this so.

Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with some points to make your argument for using Python on Linux. Here are some benefits of Python on Linux that you can use:

- Python is a **cross-platform** language, meaning it can run on multiple operating systems, including Linux¬≤. With the help of the subprocess module, Python can execute Linux commands, allowing developers to automate tasks and create powerful scripts¬≤.
- Python has a huge number of **standard libraries** for all occasions and even more open-source repositories that you can use in your work¬≥. Some of these libraries are specifically designed for machine learning and AI systems, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn and more.
- Python is a **high-level**, **dynamically typed** and **user-friendly** language that is easy to read, learn and write¬π. It has simple and regular syntax that makes it exceptionally readable and understandable. It also has user-friendly data structures that make data manipulation easier.
- Python is an **open source** language with a large active community base¬π. This means that you can access the source code of Python and modify it according to your needs. It also means that you can get support from other developers who share their knowledge and experience online.
- Using Python on Linux gives you access to tools such as vim, git and others that are widely used by developers around the world. These tools are also open source and have many features that can enhance your productivity and efficiency.

Using Python on Linux can help you achieve technology freedom because it allows you to use GPL (General Public License) software. GPL software is software that grants users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software. This means that you can use GPL software without any restrictions or limitations imposed by proprietary systems such as Windows or Mac.

I hope this helps you with your argument. Do you have any questions? üòä

This is good. Make a similar argument but focus on using Linux command-like and JupyterLab to access Linux even if you're on Windows or a Mac. Discuss how just because you're on proprietary host doesn't mean you don't have the full power of Linux at your fingertips. And because you do, you should always develop your apps in and for Linux for the long-term durability of both your apps and your career, knowlege, know-how and long-term relevancy and economic value.

Here are some points to make your argument for using Linux command-line and JupyterLab:

- Linux command-line gives you access to a powerful and versatile system that can run many programs and tools that are essential for development, such as vim, git, Python and more‚Å∂. You can also automate tasks and create scripts using Linux commands that can save you time and energy.
- JupyterLab is a web-based interface that allows you to create and work with Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, data file viewers and other custom components side by side in a tabbed work area¬π. You can use Jupyter notebooks to write code, run it interactively, visualize data and share your results with others.
- You can use Linux command-line and JupyterLab on Windows or Mac by installing them through the terminal or using a virtual machine. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of both systems without having to switch between them. You can also use JupyterLab URLs to open specific notebooks or files on any browser‚Åµ.
- Using Linux command-line and JupyterLab can help you develop your apps in and for Linux, which is a widely used operating system for servers, cloud computing, machine learning and AI systems. By developing your apps in Linux, you can ensure their compatibility and performance across different platforms. By developing your apps for Linux, you can reach a large audience of users who prefer open source software over proprietary systems.

Using Linux command-line and JupyterLab can help you enhance your career, knowledge, know-how and long-term relevancy and economic value because they allow you to learn skills that are in high demand in the market. They also allow you to use GPL software that grants you the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software without any restrictions or limitations.

Do these points help you with your argument? üòä

Describe a movement by which the importance of property host software diminishes. Whike the host, shim or she'll can provide some small variation in user interface nuances and perhaps advantage, they all offer Linux shell. They all offer full-screen mode. They all offer virtual desktops. Theu all have similar features right down to your muscle memory and habits being transferable between host platforms. This makes you resistant to disruption in the industry and less likely for your skills and know how to go obsolete over time. This movement should have some clever name tied to the nomadic and portable nature of both you and Linux and the relative unimportance of proprietary host systems. You always even have the choice of running Linux on the bare metal workout a GUI or VM. You can work on headless cloud servers directly. There os huge advantage in jumping on the bandwagon of this movement. Describe all this in your own words and name the movement.

One possible movement that you can describe is the Linux nomadic movement. This movement is based on the idea that Linux users can work from anywhere, on any device, with any operating system, as long as they have access to a Linux shell. Here are some points to explain this movement:

- The Linux nomadic movement is inspired by the free and open-source software movement, which advocates for accessibility and freedom of expression for software users and developers¬π. Linux nomads value these principles and choose Linux as their preferred platform for development, creativity and innovation.
- The Linux nomadic movement is enabled by the cross-platform compatibility of Linux, which allows it to run on multiple operating systems, such as Windows or Mac, through terminals or virtual machines. Linux nomads can also run Linux on bare metal without a graphical user interface or a virtual machine, or work on headless cloud servers directly¬≤.
- The Linux nomadic movement is characterized by a flexible and adaptable mindset that embraces change and diversity. Linux nomads are open to learning new skills and tools that can enhance their productivity and efficiency. They are also curious and humble about other cultures and perspectives that they encounter in their travels¬≥.
- The Linux nomadic movement is beneficial for both individuals and society. For individuals, it offers them the opportunity to work from anywhere, with any device, with any operating system, without being tied down by proprietary systems or limitations. It also offers them the chance to develop skills that are in high demand in the market and that are resistant to disruption or obsolescence. For society, it offers a model of collaboration and innovation that fosters diversity and creativity.

The Linux nomadic movement is a way of living and working that transcends boundaries and conventions. It is a way of using Linux as a tool for freedom and empowerment.

What do you think of this movement? üòä

I think this is awesome and realistic. Make it feel even more real. Write a story about the Linux nomadic movement catching on so that it feels real even to the biggest doubters. Even make points that will instill fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) into folks who don't want to jump onto the movement. List some risks of staying on proprietary platforms when the writing is on the wall tha the Linux nomadic movement is the inevitable future. Write a story suitable for a blog post.

Here is a possible story for a blog post about the Linux nomadic movement:

Again this is wonderful! Thank you. One of the biggest arguments against this is how popular the full web stack is, namely JavaScript, NodeJS and some JavaScript framework du jour. This is very tempting and can make you a lot of money in the sort term, but the pace of change is actually a lot faster than in the general Linux nomadic movement because the fundamentals don't change as rapidly. Full web stack is sexy and like the siren's song in tech, but ultimately if you want to learn a smaller set of tools, master them better and have them apply to a broader problem domain over a longer (nearly lifetime) span of time, you're better off with Linux, Python, vim and git. VSCode is a particularly nasty proprietary wolf in free and open source software clothing designed to corral you back to the proprietary world. Make all those arguments in a continuation of the blog article you just wrote.

Why Linux is better than web stack for long-term development

You might be wondering why you should choose Linux over web stack for your development projects. After all, web stack is popular, lucrative and trendy. It offers you a variety of tools and frameworks to create dynamic and interactive web applications. It also allows you to work with JavaScript, Node.js and other languages that are widely used in the industry.

However, web stack also has some drawbacks that might make you reconsider your choices. Here are some reasons why Linux is better than web stack for long-term development:

- Web stack is constantly changing and evolving. This means that you have to keep up with the latest trends and technologies, which can be exhausting and overwhelming. You might have to learn new frameworks or libraries every few months or years, which can make your skills obsolete or irrelevant over time. You might also have to deal with compatibility issues or bugs that arise from using different versions or combinations of tools¬π.
- Web stack is dependent on proprietary platforms and systems. This means that you have to rely on third-party services or providers that might limit your freedom and creativity. You might have to pay fees or subscriptions to use certain features or functionalities. You might also have to comply with terms and conditions that might compromise your privacy or security¬≤.
- Web stack is isolated from other platforms and systems. This means that you have to work within a specific environment that might not be compatible with other operating systems or devices. You might have difficulty accessing or transferring your files or data across different platforms. You might also miss out on opportunities for collaboration or innovation that arise from working with diverse systems¬≥.

Linux, on the other hand, offers you some advantages that make it more suitable for long-term development:

- Linux is stable and consistent. This means that you can work with a reliable
and robust system
that does not change drastically over time.
You can master a smaller set of tools
that apply to a broader problem domain
over a longer span of time.
You can also avoid compatibility issues
or bugs
that result from using different versions
or combinations of tools‚Å¥.
- Linux is free and open-source.
This means that you can work with a flexible
and versatile system
that gives you more freedom
and creativity.
You can use any features
or functionalities
without paying fees
or subscriptions.
You can also modify
or customize
the system according to your needs
or preferences‚Å¥.
- Linux is cross-platform compatible.
This means that you can work with a portable
and adaptable system
that works on any operating system,
device,
or platform.
You can access
or transfer your files
or data across different platforms easily.
You can also benefit from opportunities for collaboration
or innovation
that emerge from working with diverse systems‚Å¥.

Linux is not only an alternative but a superior choice for long-term development. It offers you more stability,
flexibility,
and compatibility than web stack.

One tool that exemplifies the advantages of Linux over web stack is VSCode‚Åµ. VSCode is a popular code editor that many web developers use for their projects. However, VSCode is also a proprietary tool that has some drawbacks such as:

- VSCode collects telemetry data from its users without their consent‚Åµ. This data includes information about user behavior,
preferences,
and errors‚Åµ. This data might be used by Microsoft for marketing purposes,
product improvement,
or other unknown reasons‚Åµ.
- VSCode requires extensions to support many languages and features‚Åµ. These extensions are often developed by third-party developers who might not maintain them properly or update them regularly‚Åµ. These extensions might also introduce bugs,
security risks,
or performance issues into VSCode‚Åµ.
- VSCode does not support vim keybindings natively‚Åµ. Vim keybindings are keyboard shortcuts that allow users to edit text faster and more efficiently than using a mouse. Vim keybindings are widely used by Linux developers who value speed,
productivity,
and ergonomics in their work.

A better alternative to VSCode is vim, which is an open-source text editor that comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions. Vim offers some benefits such as:

- Vim does not collect any telemetry data from its users without their consent. Vim respects user privacy
and security
by default.
Vim does not send any data
to any server
unless explicitly instructed by the user [6].
- Vim supports many languages
and features natively [6]. Vim has built

Again this is great. Vim has a very steep learning curve but will last you the rest of your life and is worth it. It gets into your muscle memory like driving and can never be taken away from you. It doesn't break you out of the zone or the flow by making you habit to stop and fiddle with the mouse, trackpad or menus. You have rapid key sequences and don't even have to use arrow keys. Over time it is nearly like having telepathic control of text. It's greatly compatible predecessor vi is even part of the Unix standard. While it's old, it's beloved and one of the two great text editors on the editor war that had been going on for almost a half-century. VSCode is barely a babe in the woods by comparison and it relies on a graphical user interface and the full web stack. Continue the above blog post making all these arguments to support vim and really crush VSCode

Why vim is better than VSCode for text editing

You might be wondering why you should choose vim over VSCode for your text editing needs. After all, VSCode is easy to use, has a graphical user interface, and supports many languages and features with extensions. It also allows you to work with web stack technologies such as JavaScript, Node.js and other frameworks.

However, VSCode also has some drawbacks that might make you reconsider your choices. Here are some reasons why vim is better than VSCode for text editing:

- Vim has a steep learning curve but will last you the rest of your life. This means that you have to invest some time and effort to learn how to use vim effectively, but once you do, you will never need another text editor again. Vim gets into your muscle memory like driving and can never be taken away from you¬π. You can use vim on any platform,
device,
or environment without any hassle ¬≤.
- Vim does not break you out of the zone or the flow by making you habit to stop and fiddle with the mouse,
trackpad or menus. This means that you can edit text faster and more efficiently than using a mouse. Vim has rapid key sequences and does not even require arrow keys. Over time it is nearly like having telepathic control of text¬π. You can perform complex operations with minimal keystrokes ¬≤.
- Vim is part of the Unix standard and has a long history and community behind it. This means that you can work with a reliable
and robust tool
that has been around since 1976 ¬≤. Vim is beloved by many developers who value speed,
productivity,
and ergonomics in their work ¬≥. Vim also has a large
and active community
that provides support,
documentation,
and plugins for various purposes ¬≤.

VSCode, on the other hand, offers you some disadvantages that make it less suitable for text editing:

- VSCode collects telemetry data from its users without their consent. This data includes information about user behavior,
preferences,
and errors. This data might be used by Microsoft for marketing purposes,
product improvement,
or other unknown reasons. This might compromise your privacy
or security [5].
- VSCode requires extensions to support many languages
and features [5]. These extensions are often developed by third-party developers who might not maintain them properly or update them regularly [5]. These extensions might also introduce bugs,
security risks,
or performance issues into VSCode [5]. This might affect your productivity
or quality of work [5].
- VSCode does not support vim keybindings natively [5]. Vim keybindings are keyboard shortcuts that allow users to edit text faster and more efficiently than using a mouse. Vim keybindings are widely used by Linux developers who value speed,
productivity,
and ergonomics in their work [6]. To use vim keybindings in VSCode, you
