title: LXD Linux Containers in Windows Linux WSL2, But What Is Home?
headline: "Creating a Home: Exploring the Concept of Home with John Belushi and George Carlin"
description: I explore the concept of home, referencing John Belushi and George Carlin to illustrate how labels are unnecessary. I compare the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and the MGM movie, and discuss how my mother escaped her home life in the same year as the movie. I conclude that home is where you make it, and that I am continuously reinventing myself and encouraging my loved-ones to do the same. To create a new home, I'm developing a special git repo, creating a personal homepage.

Today I answer some of the biggest questions in life: where is home? And where
do you keep all your shit? Labels are stupid. We seek better symbols through
example. I talk about the early-days SNL comedian John Belushi a lot as the
ultimate Blues viber. For a Green Arrow perspective, we look to George Carlin,
the very person who cleared the way for me to open this post with the expletive
I do. George tells it to you like it is.

Issues concerning ‚Äúhome‚Äù and your ***true identity*** cut to the quick, as the
movie-version of The Marvelous Wizard of OZ says. George has some other ways of
saying it. Call it what you will. We all go through several rebirths in our
lives. Home changes. Where we store our stuff changes. It may or may not change
you, depending on what you want and how you let it.

Dorothy was born into bleak, gray Kansas. What the MGM movie did was not just
an artistic decision celebrating Technicolor movie production. No, the book,
actually named The ***Wonderful*** Wizard of Oz, opened in black and white too.
Don't believe me? Here's an excerpt:

‚ÄúWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but
the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad
sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.
The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running
through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of
the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once
the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains
washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.‚Äù

Ahh, there's no place like home, right Dorothy? At least for the mainstream
movie audience that need some good old American Way brainwashing. I told you I
was born the same year as UNIX, 50-miles from Murray Hill, NJ, right? For those
who bust on New Jersey‚Äîwe just gave you the modern digital world, is all. And
when Washington crossed the Delaware from Pennsylvania to turn the
revolutionary war, where was it into? New Jersey. You're both free and on your
phone or computer right now because of what? New Jersey.

We'll, my mom was born the same year as The Wizard of OZ, 1939, just 20-days
before its release. I think to myself her problems probably began with such a
large cultural event stealing all the thunder of her birth, additionally
aggregated by being the 3rd of 3 children and the first girl in a family that
didn't much value females I'm told‚Äîold-school Hungary-fleeing pre-WWII
merchant-class Jews as they were. My Pop Pop ran a shoe store while his two
sons entertained themselves by throwing tennis balls at my mom growing up. Ahh,
home.

We'll, Dorothy and my mom escaped. Little known fact, Dorothy's experience
wasn't really a dream. Unlike Alice's adventure in Wonderland where she woke up
and returned to her static state, Dorothy really went to the land of Oz,
located hidden in the middle of the uncrossable great desert somewhere in the
United States. I suspect it was for the solar power or maybe geothermal energy
sources for the data center Oz would require. Data center locations are kept
secret too when they can be. Baum was a true channeler.

Oz is real and Dorothy eventually moved her doubting Aunt Em and Uncle Henry
there who started out living fancy in the urban Emerald City but ended up
moving to a small farm in Munchkin-land for familiarity and comfort. Ah, home.
There's no place like home, but it need not be bleak grey Kansas (no disrespect
to the fine city of Topeka that birthed the Amiga Computer's Video Toaster).
Home is where you move your Aunt Em and Uncle Henry too, even if that means
uploading them to Oz. We'll deal with the moral implications of what to do with
the ‚Äúoriginal matter‚Äù bodies in later posts. It's the information, and ‚Äúliving
experience‚Äù it induces that actually matters.

Growing up and leaving home, still supported my parents. Later, supporting
ourselves. Getting your shit together for the 1st time for ‚Äúnext-level‚Äù
stuff‚Äîdoing it a 2nd time, a 3rd time, rinse & repeat until dead. These are
times we reinvent ourselves. You're never done reinventing yourself. It's
actually a continuous process. You're subtly doing it right now just my
listening to me. It's all been said before, but the Pied Piper gets to add
their particular flair and charm to the music. The more you let yourself ‚Äúbe
static‚Äù the more forced and painful these transitions will be‚Äîso says I.

It's true for your loved-ones too. The more you encourage them to be static
personalities and to close their minds and take up ‚Äúyour ways 2-point-oh‚Äù, the
more they're going to be pained later on when they realize it's not their ways.
It's not what makes their heart leap for joy and their soul sing. You chose
their ‚Äúhome‚Äù and slapped a ball-and-chain in their legs to keep them there as a
little carbon copy of you‚Äîprobably out of fear and not for a true love for life
you feel yourself. If you love something you set it free. If the live was real,
it may or may not come back to you. It's not about you.

But what about you? And what about home? Home is where you transition all that
is love-worthy. Home is where you organize your heart, mind and a little bit of
stuff. Don't invest too much into matter. It's just a form of ball-and-chain.
Left at your parents', it's held hostage. Moved to your living space, it's
choking. Put in public storage, it's a costly drain. Purge, my friends. Purge
and get down to what's most love-worthy and irreplaceable. That's home.
Everything else can be reacquired or recreated. Better yet, just grab enough
information about it so that it can be remembered and release similar
neurotransmitters in your brain as the space occupying boondoggle once did.

Hope is what you back up in git repos (folders or directories) and then back up
in remote repositories for safety, such as Github or Git Lab on your own
private cloud server (or two). It might sound too techie or unachievable today,
but that won't last for 10 years. Personal secure cloud servers will be as
common as external hard drives are today in under a decade. They're almost
there today with network application servers from QNAP and Synology and endless
Kickstarter projects. Put all your eggs in one basket and then back that basket
up all over the place.

Next, curate the one particular folder you call home. It holds your .vimrc (vim
configuration), .bash_profile (terminal startup script with aliases, etc.) and
a few other things such as your /usr/local/sbin contents that you can move
‚Äúhome‚Äù for the sake of a git repo backup. You're essentially packaging ‚Äúhome‚Äù
***to go***. It's what the Jews did with the canonical 5 Books of Moses and
slapped into the Ark of the Covenant every time they were kicked out of their
home and out into the diaspora. Get the most important basics. Everything else
can slip back into oral tradition. If it was really important, it'll return to
your life.

- Can my entire WSL2 LXD-host ~/ home be mapped or symlinked to my LXD ~/ home?
- If not, can I at least map or symlink ~/github in from the WSL Linux LXD host
  to LXD client?
- And what about data stores like big API data-pulls and web scrapes? Can I get
  my QNAP NAS (cloud server) drive accessible to LXD clients?

Don't answer these questions in this video. Too big! Just pose the questions to
clarify next steps in your mind. Show a few tabs of research. And leave it as a
cliffhanger as you go off to investigate on your own. But of course the answer
to all these questions is some sort of qualified Yes.

Go, Go Unstoppable Me!

What's home?

- Generic Linux Terminal (Oz)
  - UNIX will do in a pinch (Wonderland?)
- A handful of git repos where I keep all my most important and love-worthy
  stuff
- One special git repo that has what it takes to ‚Äúinitialize‚Äù a new home to
  feel comfortable
- A system to naturally ***slam out*** new homes on-demand LXD & Scripts
- Resources! Deep and inexhaustible *(generally internal)* resources so the
  above can't get taken away from you.

Bonus feature: stay alert to what makes you happy and what works best for you.
Have another ‚Äúvanity home‚Äù or public mailbox if you will where you can collect,
refine and even advertise these things about yourself. Let's call it a personal
homepage on the Web. My name is Mike Levin so why not have a domain name that
is a nearly perfect match? But you can't have spaces in a domain name and you
need to choose a top-level domain (TLD). What about MikeLev.in? Okay but it
implies the wrong pronunciation. Emojis to the rescue. I have a üé§. I like to
talk. I üíô to talk into the mic. I'm üé§ üíôin, so let's begin.

Why would you do this? Why would you share your current interpretation of who
you are and what you're about on the Internet? It's to help satisfy the second
tier of the Maslow Pyramid of Needs: societal connections and belongings. I'm
connecting with Scott M for example in my video chats, a 20-year veteran of the
Murray Hill NJ facility where UNIX and half our modern world was invented.
There's that and that he sounds like an interesting guy himself to boot. So,
let's boot. It's never too late to reboot. Pick yourselves up by the bootstrap
and defy the law of conservation of momentum. Be human!

- As a human, you just might:
  - Defy the 2nd rule of thermodynamics (things go to chaos)
  - Defy the Law of conservation of momentum

That just may be the purpose of sentient life.

There's no place like the current instantiation of your system for defining
current home.
