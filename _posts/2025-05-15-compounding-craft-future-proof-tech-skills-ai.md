permalink: /futureproof/compounding-craft-future-proof-tech-skills-ai/
description: I'm laying out my philosophy for not just surviving, but thriving, in a tech world obsessed with fleeting trends and rapid skill obsolescence, a problem now amplified by AI. It's about rejecting the typical career path of burning out on short-lived passions and instead, investing in foundational, "old-school" tools like Linux, Python, vim, git, and Nix (my LPvgn stack). I believe that by focusing on these enduring technologies and embracing a mindset of small, compounding wins, we can achieve a form of craftsmanship and build skills that last, all while maintaining our personal agency and even leveraging AI on our own terms, which is what I'm trying to embody with my Pipulate project.

## The Quest for Enduring Skills in an Ephemeral Tech World

This article explores a common frustration for people working in technology: the incredibly fast pace at which skills and software tools become outdated. Imagine spending years mastering a specific programming language or platform, only to find it's no longer in demand or has been replaced by something entirely new just a few years later. This "tech churn" can be disheartening, especially for those who are passionate about the craft of building software. The author discusses this challenge, particularly how the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to be speeding up this cycle of obsolescence.

The core idea presented is a strategy to "future-proof" one's career by focusing on foundational, often open-source, technologies that have stood the test of time, rather than constantly chasing the newest, shiniest tools. It's about building a solid base of skills that are less likely to disappear, allowing for deeper mastery and a more sustainable, fulfilling career, akin to how a craftsperson hones their skills with timeless tools. The author also emphasizes the importance of continuous small improvements and personal agency in navigating this ever-changing landscape.

## The Accelerating Pace of Tech Obsolescence

This article is about nonstop, successive little refinements — wins that stack
upon each other until you're sitting on top of a big pile of win. This principle
is usually applied towards compounding interest with saving money, but it also
applies to investing in your skills and feeding your soul. Musicians and artists
come to mind, those who do what they do for the love of it. Folks like me get
attracted to fields in technology with that same soul-feeding feeling. Star Trek
and all. But the disillusionment sets in quickly because the actual tools of the
trade change so quickly in tech. If we're lucky our skills only go obsolete in 5
to 10 year cycles. Now with the emergence of AI it feels like the pace of rapid
obsolescence is only accelerating. Here I show you how we stem that tide and
future-proof ourselves.

## Is Craftsmanship Possible in Software?

All my life I have had the giant red reset button of tech press on me. This is
not unexpected, it is just the nature of technology. Yet at the same time, it is
not necessarily a truism. That feeling you get from woodworking, textiles,
ceramics, music and all those human experiences deeply rooted in tradition and
require a significant investment of time to master the skills and knowledge
necessary to produce high-quality, often bespoke, items. Apps and programs are
exactly such items, but one will hardly become an heirloom. The emphasis with
craft is on the hand of the maker, attention to detail, and the enduring quality
of the finished product. But in tech there's a new framework version every year
breaking all your code. And massive shifts that obsolete everything you know
happen every 5 to 10 years. Is craftsmanship possible in tech? Is longevity of
relevant skills and know-how really possible? Can apps endure for ages?

## Rejecting the Tech Career Hamster Wheel

Usually the answer is no. Stuff goes obsolete sufficiently quick that if you're
in some field for the love of it, you had better squeeze that lemon in the first
10 years of your career, be ready to switch to something else for the 2nd 10
years, and have your transition to management ready where you totally give up
that love for the craft in favor of stability and making room for the younger
generation. In other words cram the love into a compressed time-period, make
your fortune, get promoted to management and make room for the next fresh new
generation who hasn't yet gone through the obsolescence and disillusionment
cycle yet. This is the way of tech... NOT! Not for me, at least. I fell in love
with the sort of magic spells you can weave and cast in tech and just because
quarterly revenue reports love tech-churn and you getting caught up on the
hamster wheel doesn't mean you have to stay on it. 

## The Allure and Trap of Shiny New Toys

You can buck the trend of rapid obsolescence in tech if you just take up skills
that inherently resist that obsolescence. The rub is that when you try to take
up tools that resist obsolescence, they tend to be ones where the popular crowd
will turn you away from because those tools feel old and also have a steeper
learning curve than the shiny new toys. Shiny new toys make companies money!
Shiny new proprietary products are usually easier to use but go obsolete sooner.
But they are so, so sexy! Trends and fads drive the economic machine. Nobody's
interested in you having long-term skills and obsolescence resistance but you.
Nobody makes money off of you using the free and open source fundamental fabric
of tech that seems complicated, passé and out of vogue. But that stuff rules.

## The Power of Foundational, Open-Source Tools

And so we've got to package the old school tools in new ways to make them appear
sexy. We need to not let the popular crowd keep you from seeing the
preponderance of evidence that Linux, Python, vim and git are really what
everything else is built on. We need to start letting you boostrap and kickstart
projects in little approachable ways that uses this oldschool fundamental tech
and start building on little wins. We avoid boiling the ocean. We avoid biting
off more than we can chew. We pair down our ambition and focus on some tiny
baby-step win that is realistically possible. Bank a small win up-front as soon
as possible and create that dopamine neurochemical surge that crates positive
reinforcement and builds momentum. Commit it. Create a checkpoint. Make it a
learning moment. Plan the next step.

## Compounding Wins: The Strategy of Incremental Refinements

Iterative refinements makes a never-ending upward spiral of progress. While it
is true there is always the argument that you got things wrong on your first
pass and it's always good to do a rewrite after you know better, this only takes
you so far before it switches from a learning experience to destructive. The
expression goes you have to do something 3 times to get it right: once to know
what you don't know. Twice to get a lot of things better the second time. And
third to really nail it. However, that only works if your workshop is full of
the same tools each time. When the very world of tools is swirling and changing
around you, your muscle memory never gets a chance to master the tools and
you're excessively reset to beginner. SOME advancement needs to happen.

## The Optimal Stopping Distance for Skill Acquisition

It is a similar algorithmic question in life as optimum stopping distance which
asks questions like if you're looking for your next place to live and you find
something that seems good enough, should you keep looking and risk loosing the
first opportunity, or should you lock it in right away or keep looking for the
perfect match? Studies show you should probably go about 20% to 30% of the full
100% of the time/effort you were willing to go if you find a good enough match.
That's the optimal stopping distance. Anything more would be a waste. Anything
less would miss too much opportunity.

On this note, you want to lock in on the tech that will serve you for the rest
of your life early enough in life so that you can get that compounding returns
effect. You want to learn all the tools in your tool shop and start to master
them the way a musician does their instrument. You want to get the ball rolling.
Explore different tech and tools for the first 30% of your career — and while
you've obviously still got to learn and wrap-in new things, master the core
tools that will serve you the rest of your life. Learn to slam text around
almost telepathically with either vim or emacs. Sorry folks, the two original
editors of the text editor wars are still king. VSCode/Cursor is nice but where
are they going to be in another 10 or 20 years?

## My Journey to Embracing Enduring Tech

Even though I held Fred Fish public domain disk #591 in my hands in 1991 when
vim made its first big public appearance, I didn't take it up soon enough. It
was only many years later in my career when I truly realized the significance of
the vi/vim text editor in my quest to future-proof myself that I took it up with
sincerity and got over that learning curve. I'm 15 years into it, typing this
article in vim right now, and still getting over that initial learning curve.
Don't get me wrong. It could be worse. It could be emacs. But no really, I kid.
Notice what "mode" VSCode and every other editor worth their salt builds in.
It's vim-emulation mode. There's a reason for that.

## Introducing the LPvgn Stack: Linux, Python, Vim, Git, and Nix

Similarly Linux, Python and git fall into this category, collectively creating
the LPvg minimal short tech stack platform I like to talk about. But fear not,
you don't need to give up your Macs or Windows systems because a sort of
universal normalized Linux (Nix) now runs out of a subdirectory of your Mac or
Windows/WSL systems, adding an "n" to the short stack acronym: LPvgn! It took me
decades to cobble all this together into a single unified viable plan and
package to resist obsolescence. But there it is: Linux, Python, vim, git and
nix. And I'm not super-stringent on it. I've just got a particular magic
cocktail mix that works for me and am happy to share the formula.

## Pipulate: Applying the Philosophy in the Age of AI

But now that I have it, it's time to work on those projects and to bank those
tiny incremental compounding wins, and to validate the entire thing by turning
it into a giant pile of win. That's what I'm doing with this Pipulate project,
calibrating it very carefully in the age of AI, both to take advantage of local
AI baked into the system and the giant most intelligent frontier models of AI
that have to be used as cloud services. It's like I'm solving simultaneous
equations balancing all these factors of old-school future-proofing, being slick
and relevant enough for tomorrow's world, and producing something of great
utility and potentially broad appeal and interest today.

## The Critical Role of Personal Agency

I have a lot of time to make up for not having found my way to LPvgn sooner, but
now that I have, I am knee-deep in my magnum opus project where I use it. I am
deeply involved in a series of deeply focused nose-to-the-grindstone sprints
from which I am trying to emerge from soon without having burnt out, with tales
to tell and all the fodder for the book written in the process. And if I play my
AI cards right, the book will quite literally write itself... first one way,
then the next, and so on until perfectly optimized. Craft, my friends! Heirloom
software and systems!

### Breaking Free from the Excuse Cycle

I think a lot of us externalize excuses in our lives. If only this… If things
just happened this other way… I'm full of potential except for the fact… you
know, the same old story. We make our own destinies and if we don't like the one
that we find ourselves in, we modify our stories to protect our self images.
There's infinite reasons to blame outside forces for why the situation isn't
what we want it to be, but only one reason it might become what we wanted to be:
exercising our own agency.

### Using AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement for Thought

Writing such as this is exactly such an exercise in agency. It's so funny that
these very writing exercises are what lazy bumpkins want to outsource to the
AIs! Right? I mean I might use them to clean up my writing or as a sounding
wall, or even to do research — but never to generate the ideas in the first
place. That is the total opposite of having personal agency. That's the ultimate
expression of having yielded one's own inner self over to external forces that
corral, wrangle and coerce you. Carve out a space for your own inner mind.
Preserve the ability to drudge it all up when you need to without being told
what you should think.

### The Power of Writing as Life Navigation

We start typing. Our guts and emotions and instincts bring us one direction. Our
rational mind is allowed to have oversight and kicks-in to make this
modification or that directional tweak. We steer our writing and thereby steer
our destinies. This is no joke if we actually base our actions on our processed
and deliberated over writings. This is not whimsy. This is life-steering.

### Overcoming Our Evolutionary Programming

Overriding the currents, eddies and tides of life is not only overcoming our
circumstances but is also overcoming our more base animistic lower-brain
functions evolved into us because our rational brains aren't fast enough to save
our lives in every condition — our lizard-brains and our worm-brains such as
they are. Agency is setting sail and taking command over all that.

Here's a breakdown of the key points and themes in the article:

**The Core Problem: Rapid Obsolescence in Tech**

The author highlights a central challenge in the technology field: the rapid pace at which skills and tools become obsolete. This creates a cycle of learning, obsolescence, and disillusionment, often forcing tech professionals to:

* Squeeze their passion for the craft into the early years of their career.
* Switch to new fields or technologies every 5-10 years.
* Transition into management for stability, sacrificing their love for hands-on work.
* Feel like they are on a "hamster wheel" of constant, often company-driven, tech churn.
* The emergence of AI is perceived as accelerating this obsolescence.

**The Author's Proposed Solution: Resisting Obsolescence through Foundational, "Old-School" Tech**

The author argues that it's possible to "buck the trend" by investing in skills and tools that are inherently resistant to obsolescence. These often include:

* **Fundamental, open-source technologies:** The author champions Linux, Python, vim, and git (LPvg) as the core fabric upon which much of modern tech is built.
* **Nix:** This is added to the stack (LPvgn) as a way to create a universal, normalized Linux environment across different operating systems (Mac, Windows/WSL).
* **Steeper learning curve, but long-term payoff:** These tools might seem "old" or have a higher barrier to entry compared to shiny, new, proprietary products, but they offer enduring value and mastery.
* **Focus on craftsmanship and longevity:** The author draws a parallel to traditional crafts (woodworking, music) where mastery of tools and enduring quality are paramount, suggesting this is achievable in tech.

**The Strategy: Nonstop, Successive Little Refinements (Compounding Wins)**

Inspired by the principle of compounding interest, the author advocates for:

* **Small, incremental wins:** Focusing on tiny, achievable baby steps to build momentum and positive reinforcement (dopamine surge).
* **Iterative refinement:** Continuously improving and building upon previous successes, creating an "upward spiral of progress."
* **Avoiding "boiling the ocean":** Not trying to learn everything at once or taking on overly ambitious projects initially.
* **Committing and checkpointing:** Solidifying learning and progress at each step.

**The "Optimal Stopping Distance" in Skill Acquisition**

The author applies the concept of "optimal stopping distance" to career development:

* **Explore for the first ~30% of your career:** Experiment with different technologies.
* **Lock in on core, life-long tools:** After the exploratory phase, commit to mastering foundational tools that will provide compounding returns over time, much like a musician masters an instrument.

**The Author's Personal Journey and "Magnum Opus"**

* The author admits to not taking up vim early enough but is now a dedicated user.
* The LPvgn stack is their "magic cocktail mix" for resisting obsolescence.
* They are currently applying this philosophy to their "Pipulate project," aiming to balance old-school future-proofing with modern relevance (including local and cloud AI).

**The Importance of Personal Agency**

A strong theme towards the end of the article is the power of personal agency:

* **Rejecting external excuses:** We make our own destinies rather than blaming outside forces.
* **Steering your life through deliberate action:** Writing, for example, is presented as an exercise in agency, a way to process thoughts and steer one's path.
* **Resisting outsourcing core thinking to AI:** While AI can be a tool for cleanup or research, generating original ideas should remain a personal endeavor to maintain agency and preserve one's inner mind.
* **Overcoming base instincts:** Agency involves using our rational minds to override more primitive brain functions and take command of our direction.

**Craftsmanship and "Heirloom Software"**

The author poses the question of whether craftsmanship and enduring "heirloom" quality are possible for software. They believe that by focusing on foundational tools and iterative refinement, this ideal can be pursued, even in a rapidly changing field.

In essence, the article is a call to action for tech professionals to take control of their skill development by investing in timeless, foundational technologies and embracing a mindset of continuous, incremental improvement, thereby fostering both long-term relevance and a deeper sense of craftsmanship and personal agency.

  * **Generalization Needed:** The "Pipulate project" is a personal example; the book would benefit from more diverse case studies or more generalized applications of the principles.
  * **AI Integration Specificity:** The current text mentions "local AI baked into the system" and "frontier models"; more detail or illustrative examples would be needed in a book format to make this concrete for readers.
  * **"Book will write itself" comment:** While perhaps a turn of phrase, this might need careful framing in a book about craftsmanship and agency to avoid misinterpretation.

**AI Opinion (on Value for Future Book):**

This journal entry is highly valuable as raw material for a tech book. It captures a passionate, opinionated, and insightful perspective on a critical issue in tech careers. The author's personal journey and the development of the LPvgn philosophy provide a strong narrative thread. The core arguments for foundational skills, iterative improvement, and personal agency are compelling.

However, to become a successful book, the content will require significant structuring, editing for a broader audience (toning down some of the more informal or rant-like elements), and expansion with more detailed explanations, examples, and potentially counter-arguments or alternative perspectives. The inherent "journal" nature means it's a rich vein of thought and experience, but it's not yet a polished chapter. Its strength lies in its authenticity and the clear articulation of a survival and growth strategy.
