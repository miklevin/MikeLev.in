Wow, this latest Windows Update was a rough one. I had been doing a number of
low-level OS things especially on the Linux side of the Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL, WSL2) lately trying to get the LXD container system to work and
figured it was time for a full system reboot. I saw the little-red-dot on the
power icon of Windows 10 indicating there were downloaded updates to apply, and
I thought "great!" This must be the updates I'm waiting for.

# These Are Not The Windows Updates You're Looking For

But after a very long update process on the blue-screen it went to a
black-screen and never came back. I gave it a good generous 10-minutes... and
no luck! Force a restart with the "soft" hard reset button (there are no longer
***real hardware reset buttons*** on laptops. That's insane.

After the forced restart I went into Settings / Windows Update to see if I
could get a description of what just happened to my machine and it occurred to
me to do this livecast. It's early. It's of interest.

Get into the Zone... The Flow... The Bear Necessities...

Forcibly get into the zone this morning because of distractions that could not
be allowed. One controls their mind. Your mind is yours. No one or nothing has
the right to derail or otherwise precondition you for the day in ways you do
not want for yourself. Journals like this and playlists like that are tools to
help you condition your mind.

Yesterday I tried getting LXD (standard Linux containers) working under WSL2
(Windows Subsystem for Linux)... and failed due to a number of reasons. Things
didn't work as advertised. The remedies were deep rabbit holes. I didn't have a
successful journey through Wonderland yesterday.

# So Give A Try At LXD under WSL Again

So try getting sudo lxd init "unlocked"

Edited zfs out of /etc/modules

Restarted Linux under WSL

Following instructions under https://blog.simos.info/how-to-run-lxd-containers-in-wsl2/
pedantically.

No luck, no luck, no luck!

# LXD on Ubuntu 18.04 works vs 20.04 where it doesnt?

Ugh! Is it being on Ubuntu 20.04 versus 18.04? Maybe. Yes, just maybe.

Switch your main laptop over to Ubunutu 18.04? Simultaneously? Delete 20.04 for
fewer moving parts? Make my next video out of it? Ugh! Maybe. Just maybe.
