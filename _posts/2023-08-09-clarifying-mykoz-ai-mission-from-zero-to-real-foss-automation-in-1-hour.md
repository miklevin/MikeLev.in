Okay, today's going to be a big day for MyKoz.AI. I'll go through the whole
soft-launch procedure of launching a site, soup to nuts. All I've really got is
the MyKoz.AI installer script itself, which is something that replaces the
default Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version of Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) with
a version that has JuptyerLab installed in such a way that you can run Jupyter
Notebooks locally as if on a Linux Server. And this makes all the difference.

I feel the temptation to go into all the marketing and elevator pitch of all
this, but that comes later, is already done in many ways, and it's time for the
rubber to hit the road. Yeah, I'm going to use lots of old metaphors like that
because I'm old. I'm 52 years old, and I'm going to be 53 in a few weeks. I've
been in the field of search engine optimization (SEO) for 30 years, since
before there was a Google. I watched Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) go
from a $14 billion dollar company to a $14 million dollar company even though
it basically invented the industry with AltaVista, if not Unix and the Internet
itself through its PDP-11 and VAX minicomputers.

So I've been around the block a few times. No, I never worked on a VAX, but I
knew Commodore's George Robbins (barely) who did. He's one of those legendary
pioneers who slept in the office and such. I am tangentially tied to all kinds
of interesting stuff from back in the day, but am the progenitor of nothing
myself. I'm just a guy who's been around the block a few times, and I'm
starting to see the same patterns repeat themselves. It's time to make my move,
and to help all you folks dealing with the existential crisis of AI and
automation.

Folks give automation lip service, but they don't really know what it means
from a tech fundamental standpoint. There is no automation. There is only
scripts that run anew each time particular hardware is powered on. Whatever
happens then is up to the script. Of course, just loading enough for the
hardware to be operational at all comes first. It needs a system of operating.
And that obviously, is the operating system. And for many years there was a
traditional way for this startup sequence to occur on the Unix and Linux
equipment that runs the world. And it's called the System V init system. And it
was difficult as heck, requiring all sorts of wizardly and arcane knowledge to
get it to work. And it was all done in shell scripts, which are basically
command line instructions of the most basic and humanly unfriendly sort. 

This has changed. It's now quite easy to get ***real*** automation occurring in
Linux. You don't need paid products. You don't need cloud services. You don't
even need fancy hardware or home servers or anything different than what you're
already using. All you need is a few moments of suspended disbelief of the same
sort you would grant a movie or video game. Stick with me, and I'll get you
automating Linux Servers on boot-up in just a few minutes. Maybe a half-hour
depending on how much you already know. The world is different now because the
System V init system has been replaced by systemd.

So is SEO dead? Nope. It's just different. And I'm going to let my
different-ness shine for once. I've interacted with plenty of people in the SEO
industry over the years. I've been to conferences. I've been to the Googleplex
in Mountain View, California. I've been to the Microsoft campus in Redmond,
Washington. I haven't been to Yahoo in Sunnyvale, California, but I've been in
the industry in NYC for awhile and to most of the NY offices of the big
players. Oh, and the NYC Tech Meetups when you could just walk in and get a
seat. I've been around the block a few times. And I thrive on change, even
though the changes in the SEO industry over the past 30 years amount to mobile.
It's a big yawn, if you ask me. So why have I been in the industry for so long?
It's enjoyable watching the world change. And I'm going to help you change with
it now that there's a big enough Sea Change to See Change.

And it's a FOSSy change, at that! Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is the
cornerstone of the new world order. It's the only way to future-proof yourself
against the coming AI and automation. If you ask an AI what it runs on, it's
going to be some combination of Linux and FOSS. More than likely, Python is
going to be in the mix. And then everything is expressed in text. Tech is text
and text is tech. Generic control of text is power. Controlling text as
prescribed by a commercially incentivized vendor is not power. It's a
dependency. And dependencies are the opposite of power. 

Bram Moolenaar who brought us the ubiquitous and standard vim text editor
passed away 1 week ago today. He created vim, which is an improved version of
the vi text editor built into almost every version of Unix and Linux and dates
back to 1976. Vi's creator is Bill Joy is still with us, though he retired from
Sun Microsystems in 2003. And vi was based on QED and ex that came before it.
So there's a long history of ***how to edit text*** quickly, efficiently, and
powerfully. And it's all FOSS. And it's all text. And it's all Linux.

Oh, you can get vim working under Windows in Powershell or the Command Prompt,
but it's just not the same. Your ***muscle memory*** gets subtly undermined.
All the environment variables that effect how it runs are different, most
especially the HOME environment variable and the direction of your
path-slashes. DOS (and thus, Windows) use backslashes whereas the entire rest
of the world uses forward slashes. You might think this a small issue, but
issues like this compound and keep you from ever really getting into the
groove. And that's what I'm here to help you do. Get into the groove.

The main way things are different today than they used to be is that there is
not a laptop or piece of hardware out there that you could be working on
day-to-day (your daily productivity machine) that can't or doesn't support
Linux. And no, I'm not talking about replacing Windows with a Linux Desktop.
Desktops are stupid, change all the time for no good reason, and are the
biggest single enemy to your developing the long-term muscle memory that is
your secret weapon. No, I'm talking about running vim in the Linux command line
on Windows. Windows supports the Linux command line now. It's called WSL.

Nobody ***gets it*** and nobody is going to continue to get it, unless I step
in with a crystal-clear path. And that's MyKoz.AI. And that's the site I'm
launching today. It's a crystal-clear path on how to get started with vim in
the Linux command-line on Windows. It's also a gentle introduction to Python
through the familiar web browser, without any need to even look at a scary
Linux command-line. I leverage the amazing Jupyter Lab project to make this
happen. I leverage WSL's ability to host JupyterLab Linux-side even though you
interact with it Windows-side. This is a gentle way to introduce you to Linux.
It makes all your Python code immediately ***cloud compatible***, and I throw
you right into ***real*** 24x7x365 automation with the Linux systemd init
system. And I do it all in a way that you can't possibly get lost.

Most people are going to panic. They're going to think they're not smart enough
to do this. They're going to think that the rise of AI is going to make them
obsolete. They're going to think that they're going to be replaced by robots.
The thing is that AI becomes a force-multiplier for those who ***get it***. And
so to get it, you have to start somewhere. No, just "talking" isn't enough.
Talking to AI's might be a good start, but it's not how you multiply your
effectiveness and an individual human being and potential force multiplier.

Yammering on forever, or ***orating*** in other words, is not how you organize
and articulate your thoughts. I think some people are imagining a day where
they don't have to learn how to even write, much less code. But that's like
looking forward to not even having to think! It's not going to happen. You're
always going to have to think if you want to do better in life. So, how do you
get the ability to ***think better?***

You get it by writing. And you get it by writing in a way that doesn't require
you to think about the actual process of writing. You get it by committing vim
to muscle memory. You get it by writing in a way that lets you tap into those
force-multipliers that are AI and automation. You get it through MyKoz.AI.
