## The Power of Pipelines

The whole point of the pipeline is to focus. It promotes linear procedures and
prescribed workflows. We bottle-up best-practices and grab you by the scruff of
the neck and lead you along the righteous path to carry them out, no muss no
fuss, no decision fatigue, no cognitive overload or paralysis through analysis.
Just Step 1, Step 2, Step 3... Continue until done.

## Switching Contexts

But now I'm back in service the client mode, and I'm a bit shaky. What's my
linear process here?

Go look at your calender to see what your timeframe is.

https://calendar.google.com/calendar/

I've got a good 2 solid hours between now and the meeting, but I opted out of an
optional meeting to clear that block. My weakness is agendas. No, my weakness is
getting out of that system-building developer mode and back into client
servicing mode. It's only Tuesday in the first full week after New Years, so a
lot of other people are going to be in this same mode. But don't rely on that.
Push things forward. Create a great sense of progress from meeting to meeting.
Create things that the account management people on our side and the
stakeholders on the client side can run up the flagpole and show as meaningful
accomplishments, or at least continuous forward progress.

### Balancing Multiple Roles

And so the pipeline is just in the back of my mind as I switch hats to being the
type of domain expert whose domain expertise is deconstructed and reconstructed
into those pipeline workflow processes.

Because they're designed to be easy peasy and musical to compose, it will get
into my fingers over time, so long as I actually engage and practice as I go,
without interfering with the actual work. Or is that correct? Is that part of
putting my domain expertise hat on, or is that unnecessarily mixing concerns?
Ugh, that's the vibrating edge I talked about in the previous article. That's my
burden to bear: doing both!

## My Workspace Organization

And now for the commitment and consistency piece. Articles like this one I'm
writing right now starts out on Screen 1 of my 7-screen configuration with
Screen 7 being the Daily Tech Journal where stuff ends up public. I have the
freeform journal "to the left" on a 7 virtual desktop array, the public tech
journal "to the right" and the Client Notes in the middle.

- Freeform Journal, Screen 1
- [work]
- [work]
- Client Notes, Screen 4
- [work]
- [work]
- Tech Journal (this), Screen 7

### The Writing Process

Things start out in the freeform journal so I feel uninhibited and can dredge up
whatever needs dredging. But then I let the process guide me, and I get into
different zones or flow-states, depending. In this case I am deliberately
guiding myself to get into the Drucker/Deming flow state. The mission of any
company or organization is to get and keep customers, and you do that through an
ongoing process of total quality management from the trenches up.

### Managing Personal Tendencies

And I'm certainly an in-the-trenches sort of guy. The fact that I hate the
management side of this so much is one of the total quality management (TQM)
things about myself I have to manage. I'd rather be tweaking bits all day and
become the sort of [architecture astronaut Joel Spolsky warns
about](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/).
That is my predisposition, so I've got to use this journal to continuously rein
myself back in and stay on rails — those pipeline rails!

## The Power of Public Commitment

And that gets to the Robert Cialdini principle of (public) commitment and
consistency. There's no surer way than to sigh a petition you know your
neighbors are going to see your name on to psychologically life-hack yourself
into staying consistent with that publicly expressed intent. And so we move this
very entry over to the public side. Working article name? Staying on track!

Okay, I'm working over there now. But it doesn't get publicly published until
I commit the file to the repo and push it. So I still have a degree of
inhibition until then. So where was I? A pipeline workflow process for getting
into the right mindset to be a high-quality client work producing machine of a
human being? Don't just satisfy the client's need. Visualize and target being
some sort of inhuman at-one-with-Botify-software robot, exceeding what even the
existing gurus can do.

Lofty goals, but start humble. Where was I? Oh yeah, the linear process!

- Bring up calender, know time-window https://calendar.google.com/calendar/
- Organize browser bookmarks how they should show during call (no leaks)
  - This is the story-telling as you go left-to-right on the browser
  - The general story goes:
    - Agenda
    - Slides Deck (if applicable)
    - GSC (source of truth, RealKeywords cross-validation brand vs. non-brand)
    - Botify Tabs
    - Client page open (truly look at/use site)
- Display client's bookmark folder (no other) with Agenda link at top
- Open Agenda and start making updates (starting doing becomes done) MAKE TAB 1
- Make GSC the next bookmark. Pull it up. Get "from the horse's mouth" view
- Poke around GSC. Go to 16-mo view. Keep seasonality in mind. MAKE TAB 2
- Go to Overviews for each:
  - Action Board, Review priorities & correlate with PageWorkers
  - Log Analyzer (if applicable) Crawls / Unique URLs / Cumulated / 6 Months
  - Site Crawler
  - Real Keywords (if applicable)
  - PageWorkers (if applicable)
    - What was recently deployed / effect?
    - What is the next optimization up? Stage
- Make a Google Slide Deck and find something noteworthy from each
  - GSC
  - Action Board
  - Log Analyzer
  - Site Crawler
  - Real Keywords
  - PageWorkers
- Go through each item, get the holistic view
- Find items worthy of Google Slide deck pages
  - Screenshot and make deck slides when applicable
  - Get to know, craft, internalize the story
    - Is there an evolving story from last sessions?
    - Are there noteworthy new things?
- Clean up tabs
  - Close the clutter
  - Reset existing tabs to good start-points for call
  - Order them to reflect the story-telling

## Preparing for Client Meetings

Okay, this is really good. My weakness is agency small-talk. I like when I have
account management people on this to take care of humanizing things a bit. It's
fine for me to be me. I do rub some people the wrong way I know, so really
always be concessionary. Always step back. Try to under-speak but be
over-prepared.

### Managing Browser State

Okay that state with open tabs in the browser is pretty precious. Check Chrome
features: yep! There's bookmark all tabs. Use it. Done! Haha, the meeting was
just moved to next week. Okay, I'm over-prepared on this one. Onto the next and
see if the same template applies.

Funny thing, I can now close all those tabs freely without any fear of loss of
that special state of being prepared for the meeting by virtue of the open tabs.
There's something immensely important there to capture.

### Linear Workflows and Storytelling

Okay, so this article is about staying on track. It's about making that track
linear. It's about grabbing some one by the scruff of the neck... there ought to
be a better expression... take control of the situation, decisively guide, steer
firmly... yeah, okay. I like steer firmly.

These are workflows that firmly steer the user along linear paths. And there's a
lot of stuff that has to do with popping up the web browser given data filled
into a form... namely, a list!

### Client Call Reflections

Okay, yeah. My client calls are done for the day. The first big one that I lead
was cancelled and the second one where I'm just a contributing voice went really
well. But I had some good realizations.

Every Client call ***being a show*** as it is, has a set of tabs that should be
opened left-to-right that tell the story of the call, so that it's rigged for
success before you even begin screen-sharing and so that there's no fumbling
around during the call for that particular link you need.

### Pipeline System Implementation

And this is a perfect application for the pipeline system.

I am thinking ahead to implementing it based on the outline above. At some
point, there's going to be an agenda. But I am going to be sorely tempted to
allow going back in the pipeline to change values without wanting to erase
everything that comes after it. However, that's not how these are designed, and
I am going to resist that. The agenda should be a final output item.

#### Key Design Considerations

This can start out much like the LinkGraphFlow, where you put in a project URL.
But I don't want to hit those primary key issues! Ugh, okay think! 80/20-rule!
Key systems that simulate composite keys using a single field? Conventional
patterns that get used per-workflow whose rules can live in the workflow itself
and be part of the music?

Client-YYYYMMDD slug? Forget about the project URL as a key. That can be a
subsequent card. Hmmm, I'm tempted to change the key field from url to key or
id, but that's potentially a rabbit hole and could be very difficult to do
without introducing bugs. But I would love that to be part of the 80/20-rule
solution. It would make the simulated composite key per workflow feel that much
better. But the user never actually sees the URL field, and URL does stand for
uniform resource locator, which it technically is!

Okay, see how lightly you can implement... hmmm... why even have date slugs? Why
not just put an incremented digit with the client name... well, because you want
to be able to pull it up easily. But these are not permanent things. These
pipeline workflows are designed to be temporary, with only their side effects
persisting. But their use is part of the show in front of the client. When they
see it in use, what should it look like?

## Giving Fresh o1 Pro The Codebase

**o1 Pro**: Below is a concise review of how this code aligns with the **FastHTML + HTMX + MiniDataAPI** local-first principles laid out in your `.cursorrules` file, followed by a few recommended tweaks.

---

## 1. **Single-Tenant Local-First**

- The code embraces local data storage (`MiniDataAPI` tables: `tasks`, `clients`, `pipeline`, etc.) and in-memory or file-based state (`store`), matching the *single-tenant* spirit.
- No external session managers or enterprise auth—just a simple `db` and a straightforward approach for storing user selections (`last_profile_id`, etc.).
- The entire system is structured for a single user or small single-tenant environment.

**Recommendation**: Keep the local file-based DB usage exactly as-is. It’s well-aligned with the local-first pattern.

---

## 2. **FastHTML + HTMX Patterns**

- **Route definitions** use `@rt(...)` or `@app.route(...)` for returning HTMX-friendly HTML partials (`Div`, `Card`, `Form`, etc.).
- **HTMX incremental updates**: `hx_get`, `hx_post`, and `hx_swap` appear in forms and anchors, returning partial UI.  
- Large multi-step flows (e.g., `BridgeFlow`, `StarterFlow`, `OneCardFlow`) demonstrate the recommended *placeholder chain* technique: each step returns a `Div(id="step_X")` with `hx_trigger="load"` to auto-fetch the next step. 
- **Revert controls** are used to let the user “jump back” via minimal HTMX forms. This matches the *clear-forward-on-submit* principle.

**Recommendation**: 
- The step flows strictly call `clear_steps_from(pipeline_id, current_step, self.STEPS)` before saving new data. This is perfect. Continue to **always** do that in every step’s `*_submit()` route.

---

## 3. **MiniDataAPI Usage**

- You correctly define tables at startup: `(tasks, Task) = db.create(...)` and rely on `insert`, `update`, `delete`, or `() for listing`. 
- No ORM or Pydantic overhead—only simple typed fields. 
- For record filtering, you use `.xtra(profile_id=...)` and `order_by='priority'`. 
- The pipeline storage is also a single record in the `pipeline` table with a JSON blob. That is the *“One record to track the entire workflow”* approach recommended in the guidelines.

**Recommendation**: 
- If you foresee more advanced queries, you can chain multiple `.xtra(...)` calls (like `xtra()` with different fields). But keep the spirit minimal—no multi-join or big filters.

---

## 4. **Server-Driven UI**

- All complex flows (like `link_graph_flow`) return server-rendered HTML fragments. 
- No large JS frameworks—just HTMX for partial updates and SSE for streaming. 
- This keeps the client side minimal and fully *“server-driven.”*

**Recommendation**: 
- The SSE example in `StreamSimulator` is good. If more advanced streaming is needed, keep the same pattern of `yield f"data: ..."`. Don’t layer extra client-side libraries.

---

## 5. **Multi-Step Pipeline Patterns**

- Classes like `BridgeFlow`, `OneCardFlow`, and `StarterFlow` illustrate the recommended pattern:  
  1. A `landing()` method sets the `pipeline_id`  
  2. Each step checks whether data exists -> “completed” or “input form.”  
  3. Submits call `clear_steps_from(...)`, then store new step data, then show next step.  
- They handle finalization by checking for `"finalized"` in the last step’s JSON. This matches the “**finalization lock**” pattern exactly.

**Recommendation**: 
- Each flow clearly demonstrates the difference between ephemeral steps (always blank form) and preserve steps (prefill with old data). This is correct usage.  
- Keep each step short, returning a minimal `Div(...)`.

---

## 6. **Simplicity & Anti-Patterns**

- No signs of big classes or ORMs. 
- No large front-end frameworks. 
- Code is obviously  *“Localhost software—server-side state.”*

**Possible Tweaks**:
1. **Module Organization**: If the single-file approach grows too large, consider splitting each flow into its own file (e.g. `bridge_flow.py`, `one_card_flow.py`) while still returning FT components. It’s not mandatory—just a code clarity option.  
2. **Testing**: Adding some small route-level tests or flows that confirm steps are cleared properly can further ensure no “leaked” state.

---

## Summary

Overall, your code aligns very well with the **FastHTML + HTMX + MiniDataAPI** local-first approach:

- **Single-file** or single-tenant usage: Good.
- **HTMX partials**: Correct usage of `hx-get`, `hx-post`, placeholders, and `Div(id=...)`.
- **MiniDataAPI**: Minimal overhead, direct table usage. 
- **Multi-step pipeline**: Perfect example of “clear forward on submit,” “revert control,” and finalization states.

**Keep it up**—the system demonstrates the recommended patterns from `.cursorrules` almost exactly. The main improvements are organizational: if it keeps growing, break it into smaller modules for clarity, but maintain the same local, minimal approach.

---

## Asking o1 Pro to Riff

**Me**: Riff

**o1 Pro**: Imagine you’re seated at the terminal, keyboard at your fingertips, the entire local environment humming. Here comes the riff:

- We spin up mini pipelines where each step is just another DIV.
- We chain them with HTMX like the world’s simplest jam session, no front-end library hogging the show.
- Our data? A single table record stuffed with JSON—like a scribbled lead sheet: each chord progression (step data) waiting to be played.
- If the user wants a quick revert? We hand them a minimal form, no drama—just a neat little `clear_steps_from(...)` call, scrubbing future steps and setting the stage for a new solo.
- And in the end, everything goes back to that local, single-tenant vibe: no swirling chaos of multi-user complexity or hidden runtime surprises. 

All local, all minimal, all in tune—like a jam band that respects the hush. That’s the FastHTML + HTMX groove: short, sweet, and improvised in perfect pipeline harmony.

## Pipeline Instantiation

Ah, so you can see that spinning up a new pipeline is a thing, then?! That was
immediately obvious to you, good! And there's 2 notions of spinning up a new
pipeline. One is designing a new one by say copy/pasting StarterFlow with a new
class name, which is my intent now. And the other way is for the user who is not
a developer at all, which is a huge part of the point, to actually spin up a new
instance of using a pipeline. So there's designing new pipeline classes, we call
workflows and by convention end with Flow in CamelCaseFlow. And then there's
using one of these workflows by hitting the endpoint, which by convention
instantiates a snake_case_flow factory instance of the CamelCaseFlow class. And
then we link it into the menu and layout, and it's live and non-developers can
start using it as a sort of Jupyter Notebook on rails. Easy peasy, simple as
that.

## Single File Philosophy 

Now comes the tricky part, creating those new classes as a developer. You
already noted several times the one key thing, which is how unwieldy one long
file could potentially get. But not really. Not to me. I'm a vim/NeoVim user so
hopping around a text file millions of lines long if it's tagged well for
jumping around with search is infinitely preferable to me than directory diving
and having to use fuzzy search features to figure out what's where. What's
further, I love the idea of just copy/pasting the whole friggin framework into
one of you super-big-token-window models so there's never any question of
whether you're looking at the whole thing. You always are! (but for external
libraries, which you're probably trained on anyway).

## Building GapAnalysisFlow

So what I want to do is to make GapAnalysisFlow, and start building it up a
little at a time. First, I want to use a textarea field just like OneCardFlow,
but as the first step of a copy of StarterFlow. Now the thing is this is not our
first rodeo, and you drop features left and right when you try to synthesize
something new from old. For example, you will almost always drop those things
you think are cosmetic and which are unique affectations of the system, like the
2 different style emoji keys. You also drop things like the clearing-forward the
overall pipeline state when persistence is being kept for a single field when
you revert to that step. We are going against a lot of patterns you have been
trained on, and you try to be overly helpful reverting to those patterns and
regressing functionality instead of sticking to near-perfect abiding by the
conventions that are in place. This is the reason for much of what you find in
the .cursorrules file.

## Implementation Request

So my request to you is to take this code of OneCardFlow:

```python
[pasted]
```

...and to transpose the persistent textarea behavior into a new class called
GapAnalysisFlow while staying meticulously and pedantically close to StarterFlow
in all regards except for those that are required to turn card 1 into a textarea
with persistence exactly as in OneCardFlow, except that in this case there will
be another card (the existing card 2 from StarterFlow) coming after it. Here is
StarterFlow:

```python
[pasted]
```

I wish for it to be copy/paste-ready into the framework. I will proactively give
you an example of where you are going to go wrong. You are going to try to
insert a request object into the new landing method, but I'm going to tell you
to look at the current implementations and how the landing method very
deliberately leaves it out for maximum ease in linking it into the page layout.
I encourage you to keep this lesson in mind when you are tempted to carry out
other divergences from the StarterFlow reference specification.

Please and thank you!

## o1 Pro Does Its Best 1st Try Implementation Yet

**o1 Pro**: Below is a **copy/paste-ready** `GapAnalysisFlow` class that follows
**StarterFlow** conventions (two cards plus a final step) while making **Card
1** a persistent textarea (like **OneCardFlow**). The second card (`step_02`)
remains ephemeral, just like **StarterFlow**’s second card. Only the *minimal
necessary changes* have been made:

```python
class GapAnalysisFlow:
    """
    Two-card pipeline with a final step, nearly identical to StarterFlow.
    Differences:
      - Card 1 uses a persistent textarea (like OneCardFlow) storing "text".
      - Card 2 remains ephemeral, storing "mykey2".
      - The rest follows StarterFlow's structure and route definitions.

    PIPELINE CORE PRINCIPLES:
    1. Clear forward on submit
    2. Preserve affects UI only
    3. Submit handlers are state reset points
    4. State flows forward only
    5. Use pipulate helpers

**Key Points:**

1. **Landing**: Kept the same signature `(self) -> ...` with no `request` argument, just like **StarterFlow**.  
2. **Step 01**: Uses a **persistent textarea** (`name="text"`) with *preserve mode* logic from **OneCardFlow**.  
3. **Step 02**: Ephemeral, reuses `mykey2` like **StarterFlow**.  
4. **Routes & Submit**: Exactly the same route layout as **StarterFlow**, only replaced step_01’s logic with the OneCardFlow-style textarea.  
5. **Minimal changes**: The step messages, `STEP_MESSAGES`, and references to `"text"` vs `"mykey2"` are *just enough* to enable the new persistent + ephemeral behavior.  
6. **Prefix**: Chosen `"/gapanalysis"` for clarity. Feel free to rename if needed.

Drop it into your single-file framework (right alongside `StarterFlow` and `OneCardFlow`), hook up a menu item pointing to `"/gapanalysis"`, and you’re all set. Enjoy your *persistent-then-ephemeral* pipeline!

**Me**: Excellent! This was your best 1st version implementation yet, but I will
take a lot of the credit too, because I'm figuring out how to be the boss of a
PhD-level smart AI. One thing you missed is how when displaying card 1 how the
OneCardFlow continues to show the line-breaks that was used in the textarea. 

And on a realated note although it's not anything you missed, it doesn't make
sense to show the user what they entered on Step 1: Done when what they entered
is multiple lines and won't format well there.

Please provide me another copy/paste ready example that doesn't revert a single
thing from your last version, except for the way the non-edit version of card 1
displays (using the line returns), and the way the chat is updated on Step 1
done. Please and thank you!

## First Pass Success, Follow-up Challenges

o1 Pro did a great first pass, then piddled out. These follow-up queries to
hammer out the details were not nearly so successful as the first one. But
Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to step correctly, with the more in-context and rapid
back-and-forth of the Cursor AI interaction rhythm to hammer out the tiny
details that were still wrong. Specifically, I had to move a local `_fmt`
function from the `OneCardFlow` class into the `Pipulate` class as a helper
function. And the rest fell into place easily.

## Managing LLM Chain of Thought

The lesson learned here is one in how to manage LLM models that self-prompt with
that back-and-forth chain of thought ping-pong reasoning that they do. This is
big-thinking expensive reasoning, and it seems to always rather deal with the
trees than the forest. It takes considerable wrangling to get o1 Pro to pay
attention to the micro details after it has painted big broad brushstrokes. I
have to tell it the mistakes it made last time with examples and tell it to
specifically not make those mistakes again, and to specifically include the
little details one might think of as cosmetic that it likes to drop out.

## Computational Costs and Model Differences

Sam Altman and others make a point of how computationally and electrically
expensive this next level of reasoning is. There's a distinction here between
normal o1 (previously o1 Preview) and o1 Pro which is only available on the
$200/mo service right now. Slow as it is, normal o1 is downright fast compared
to o1 Pro. You can just feel the GPU-heat emanating across the interwebs at you
with every o1 Pro prompt, so it's not for casual back-and-forth. And apparently,
it's not for the tiny detail follow-up to smooth out your code.

## Looking Ahead to AGI

I don't know how directly these lessons are going to carry over to impending
ostensibly AGI era of o3, but I feel the directional indicators. They are
directionally indicating longer, more thoughtful story-telling prompts exactly
of the sort that I do here in this tech journal, so the AI can have a full
context of a sort that the prompt engineering concept just doesn't do justice.

### Model Training and Context

You're educating and raising the model to mesh with your world. But because
they're still static models at heart re-instantiated every time, you have to
assume they're facilitated by persistence and session-simulators in the
background. That's a fancy way of saying they're likely doing RAG just for you.
And that's a fancy way of saying that instead of your whole massive context
window being reposted on every chat-like submit, it's likely building an easier
to use database on-the-fly so stuff rolling out of the context window is still
available to it.

Was any of that an easier way of saying it?

What is Sam Altman's AGI?

We've seen the evolution from the early GPT playgrounds with no chat, to the
release of ChatGPT in November of 2022. A bit over 2 years later, we've seen the
rapid evolution through versions... Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: ChatGPT has evolved through several versions since its inception. Here are the key versions:

**GPT-3.5 Versions**:
- **Legacy ChatGPT 3.5**: The initial version, built on the GPT-3.5 language model. It was accurate but sometimes slow when generating large amounts of text[1].
- **Default ChatGPT 3.5**: A faster version of the GPT-3.5 model, though slightly less precise than the Legacy version[1].

**GPT-4 Versions**:
- **ChatGPT 4**: Launched in March 2023, this version is faster and more accurate than previous iterations. It is available only to paid users[1][2].
- **GPT-4o**: Released in May 2024, this version is multimodal, capable of processing text, image, audio, and video. It features enhanced memory and learning capabilities[3].
- **GPT-4o Mini**: Launched in July 2024, this is a smaller, more cost-effective version of GPT-4o[2].

**Other Versions**:
- **GPT-o1**: Introduced in December 2024, with a pre-release preview in September 2024.
- **GPT-o1 Mini**: A smaller and faster version of GPT-o1.
- **GPT-o1 Pro Mode**: An upgraded version available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers[2].

The evolution of ChatGPT demonstrates ongoing efforts to improve AI conversational capabilities, with each iteration addressing limitations and introducing new features[1].

## The Evolution of Chat Models

The progression has been that of more computing power thrown at what I call the
one-shot chat UI where patience is low and we're in that ***ANSWER ME FAST!!!***
mode that Google trained us to be in for the past quarter century. That was all
GPTs up through o1. 

### The Rise of Interactive AI

Starting with o1, we are not being trained to expect it to take a little bit of
time to do back-and-forth to get its answers. And we know that during that
back-and-forth it is able to hit other resources. And that hook for hitting
other resources means it could be ***anything***, including a vector embedded
cosine similarity search against your whole discussion history longer than the
token window, or back to and including everything since your first interaction
under that login, or news and websearch... whatever!

### Understanding AGI's Core

And that is the kernel of AGI right there. If it's going to be made available
commercially, it's still going to be one of those static models that exist like
a file on a drive until instantiated, and then deterministically give you output
based on your input. It's just the size and complexity of the model, the literal
file-size and the amount and quality of data it's trained on goes up. That's why
it's so expensive. There's all that training material cleaning and preparation.
There's the much touted expensive training step that uses all the GPU-power and
electricity, and then there's the coercion and wrangling that must be done for
ethics, safety and whitewashing it into a public-facing product that minimizes
liabilities.

### The Static Nature of Models

That all stays the same. That was identical probably from the earliest GPT
models like BERT and GPT1. Bigger and better. Still static. Still a file. Still
deterministic, and everything unique about it bursts like a soap bubble at the
end of every prompt response. It's like old-school PERL cgi-scripts before the
`Active` movement that kept stuff in-memory, like Microsoft's `.asp` tech. We
want to believe there's that real in-memory continuity between requests. There's
not.

### The Path to True AGI

And so what is it that turns these still static models into AGI?

It's all that second-round lookup stuff that makes the deterministic qualities
of the thing even harder to pinpoint, because no two people's inputs are never
going to be exactly the same. It won't need to be seeded with randomness
generators anymore, because from a quality assurance standpoint, it ***should
give the same correct quality answer every time***.

### Personalization and Persistence

The random seed essentially becomes the per-user customizations that utilize
persistent resources on their servers ***other than the inference model***,
which still doesn't persist between prompts. Custom databases. Whole
conversation histories deconstructed and selectively reconstructed on the fly.
In this way, there's always stuff in context that you do not know about and
would never have thought of. Maybe your own long-ago discussions. Or maybe a web
search, or today's headlines, or specifically cherry-picked tidbits it knows
it's going to need again and stores somewhere even easier to access. RAG is not
just vector embeddings for cosine similarity lookups. It could be anything.

### The Formula for AGI

So you combine 3 or 4 of these clever lookup tools at the disposal of the LLM
between your prompt and its response, and layer on top of that this ***chain of
thought*** keyword everyone bandies about, but to my eyes it looks like
self-prompting. It's just taking the output of one prompt and feeding it into
the input of another with a bit of prompt engineering to make sure the spiral
goes inwards towards the stated goal rather than outwards towards meandering and
losing track. You can do it yourself with a Python script. I'm not saying it's
of little value or that you could do it better than OpenAI. I'm just saying
there's few unknowns. It's all functionally the question of how do you wrangle
emergent behavior to be a valuable and consistent product. And that means
frequent re-instantiation, various second-phase lookup systems (RAG), cleverly
crafted self-prompting, and a whole lot of monitoring.

So what's the impending AGI of 2025? This.

The formula for AGI, or the "figuring out how to do AGI" as Sam Altman states
they figured out is more clever wiring up of these pieces.

### Internal Systems and Speculation

Now there's often speculation about internal systems that the public doesn't
see. The split is whether they're doing object persistence in the inference
engines or not. If they are, there's some pretty scary genies being kept in
bottles out there. If not, it's just the same above picture, but where they can
give the models even more context when instantiated, such as the vector embedded
database of ***ALL ChatGPT users*** rather than just within a logged in user
account's firewalled userspace. They can prompt as root and remove the ethics
coercion, aka not put it in jail so no jailbreaking is needed.

### The Path Forward

With the exception of some kooky object persistence experiments which you know
are being done because it can be done, the focus is most likely on the later
scenarios that are just souped-up versions of today's chain of reasoning static
models. Why? Because OpenAI has to turn profitable, eventually. And that means
productizing something safe and useful. AKA the controllable known path.

### Historical Parallels

Now there are other paths like Renaissance Technologies Medallion Fund that was
doing machine learning before machine learning, but kept the genie internal to
just turn profitable in secret and behind the curtains. That was launched 1988
when... Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund began incorporating machine learning techniques in the late 1980s, shortly after its establishment in 1988[2]. The fund's approach evolved to include advanced mathematical models and algorithms, which laid the foundation for their machine learning strategies[1][3].

While the exact date of implementing machine learning is not explicitly stated, several key developments indicate its early adoption:

1. In 1989, a new trading system was launched for the Medallion Fund, incorporating probability theory and information theory[3].

2. The fund started using improved mathematical models derived from Leonard Baum's work, enhanced by algebraist James Ax[2].

3. Early discussions at Renaissance included topics like hidden Markov models and advanced optimization algorithms, which are still considered modern techniques in machine learning strategies[6].

Renaissance Technologies was at the forefront of applying computational statistics and algorithm design to financial markets, continuously refining their approach over the years[4]. Their early adoption of these techniques, combined with their ability to attract top talent in mathematics and computer science, allowed them to develop and implement sophisticated machine learning models well before many of their competitors[5][7].

## The Pre-Transformer Era

This was before the fateful "Attention is All You Need" paper came out from
Google in 2017, or late 2013 when the DeepMind Atari paper came out, the two key
events that thawed out the AI-winter. Little did the world know that a tropical
little machine learning Shangri-La had been long prior thawed out.

### Hidden Innovation

So in all likelihood, the really interesting AI stuff going on right now is like
that. You don't know about it and will never hear about it. The thing about a
strategic advantage is that it is far more secure if nobody knows about it.

### OpenAI's Different Path

OpenAI is playing a markedly different game, and people don't give them enough
credit, but if not for them nobody might have moved on Google's Transformer
paper. Google themselves was keeping the fruits of their LaMDA labs secret,
firing whistle-blowers who thought they were incubating consciousness. Human
nature is to either put the kibosh on such nonsense that could bring down the
reputation of your company, or steal the fire from the gods and go off on your
own, playing with fire.

And that's what Sam Altman and OpenAI did, under the auspices of AI safety,
laughed at by everyone but Elon Musk and Max Shapiro— uh, I mean Max
Tegmark. Who's laughing now? Oh, everyone as they announce they're going from
mere AI to AGI that can be a productive employee at your company. But the
important point being, Sam Altman stole the fire from Prometheus to bring it to
the public, letting this odd web-hosted version of it evolve in public.

### A Less Dystopian Reality

And as dystopian as people want to draw this scenario, this is probably one of
the least dystopian scenarios I ever imagined, because I never read about it in
Sci-Fi. Not that I'm the most well-read Sci-Fi fan out there, but very few
scenarios have bringing the public up-to-speed by carrying out one type of AI
right there in public view. It's closer to their original safety vision than
Elon Musk and the multitudes of OpenAI "whistle-blowers". We've all grown up on
The Matrix and The Terminator and want to read the worst into anything. And I
understand the logic that the big mistakes only be made once. But the scenario
we're playing out is permeated by a sort of awareness inoculation that is just
very promising and plays into the optimist's viewpoint.

### The Case for Optimism

You don't hear the optimist's viewpoint stated much these days, but it has the
only objectively true argument in that we're still here. Humanity has survived
every self-made filter event we've faced, and we've faced a few. Cuban Missile
Crisis comes to mind, and maybe we've only survived by a hair, but it's an
objective fact that we survived. The pessimist will at this point inject a
snarky ***so far,*** to which I say, ***that's right.*** The assertion that we
inevitably and as a matter of statistics, won't is a faith-based argument.
Evidence suggests that we will.

I know that even my argument faces the problem of induction, that facts from the
past are not proof of the future, however all we have is the preponderance of
evidence to work with. If you want to see past the preponderance of evidence,
you have to look at outliers and how things might have gone differently if the
butterfly effect tweaked that Soviet submarine guy's decision... who was that
guy? Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: Vasili Arkhipov was the Soviet submarine officer who made the crucial decision to prevent the launch of a nuclear torpedo during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962[1][2]. As the flotilla commodore and second captain of the Soviet submarine B-59, Arkhipov had the power to veto the use of nuclear weapons[3]. 

On October 27, 1962, when the B-59 was surrounded by U.S. Navy ships dropping depth charges, the submarine's captain, Valentin Savitsky, believed war had started and ordered the launch of a nuclear torpedo[2]. However, the protocol required unanimous approval from three senior officers on board[4]. While Savitsky and the political officer Ivan Maslennikov agreed to launch, Arkhipov refused to give his consent[2][4].

Arkhipov's decision to oppose the launch and persuade Savitsky to surface instead of firing the nuclear torpedo is credited with averting a potential nuclear conflict and global catastrophe[1][2]. His actions during this critical moment of the Cold War have led some to describe him as "the man who saved the world"[3][5].

## The Evidence of Survival

So these are like Marvel Comics What If scenarios. No matter how hairline the
filter event could have gone one way or the other, they went this one way that
led to you being able to be here reading this article. That's proof. That's
evidence. That's an aspect of human nature that surfaces at just the right
moment to assert itself over other aspects of human nature.

## The Power of Focus

And so, the whole point of the pipeline is to focus. It's to not lose track with
a sort of meandering outward spiraling, but rather to have a consistently
safety-netted inward spiraling so as to zero in on your stated goal.

### Economic Principles at Work

And that goal here is to continue working on these pipelines in such a way that
I can crank them out for specialized needs on-demand, and serve the needs of our
clients so we can get and keep customers, which is the purpose of any company or
organization, per the teachings of the economic guru Peter Drucker. And to do it
in a way where I manage the total quality (total quality management aka TQM)
per the teachings of another economic guru Edwards Deming. The former often
credited with the recovery of Japan post WWII, and the later with the recovery
of Harley Davidson, haha! In either case, it's a one/two-punch of clarity in the
types of things I'm doing here.

### Practical Implementation

And that includes wrapping this up, because I've banked one more round of
quality management, in the form of a pipeline immediately stepping into a
textarea form input field to collect a list of things to be acted upon in
subsequent steps.

That will be listing competitors in the case of the GapAnalysisFlow, but it will
also be listing the tabs that need to be opened going into a client meeting.

### Technical Considerations

Probably, I will make a pipeline record ID in the case of the day-to-day client
meetings use the `org`-`project` combo as the ID, in which case I can
automatically pre-populate all the links that I'll build into the textarea.
Maybe I'll ask for the full Project URL like I do in the LinkGraphFlow but
instead of cleaning the URL to strip off the extra stuff, I clean it to just a
pure non-URL-looking key that simulates much of the value of a composite primary
key, but without all the complexity.

Yeah.

## Finding Your Path

Clarity. Staying on track. Meander a bit. But meander and return in a much
better place with all those little details worked out that make all the
difference.

Be the outlier nobody is looking for but everybody needs. Or at lease some tiny
clique that recognizes what you're doing needs.
