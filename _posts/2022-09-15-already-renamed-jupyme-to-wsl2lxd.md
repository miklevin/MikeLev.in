title: Already Renamed Jupyme to WSL2LXD
headline: "Reclaiming My Detail-Oriented Skills: My Journey to Mastering Detail with WSL2LXD"
description: I recently renamed my jupyme repository to wsl2lxd for improved searchability and memorability. After 15-20 years of being away from detail-oriented work, I'm back and better than ever. To further my skills, I leveraged my vim spell-checking, putting my en.utf-8.add file in my vim repo and activated an Ubuntu 20.04 under WSL to be separate from my LXD work.

Pulling out all stops. My first version of the WSL 2 LXD install script is
already pretty solid. I renamed jupyme repo to wsl2lxd which is a lot easier to
remember, more searched on and probably of greater widespread value than just
another way of getting Jupyter running. Act on important ideas quickly. This is
all a soul-cleansing experience for me. I'm learning how to be thorough again.
Nothing quite so heady since I made Levinux. Good! I need to get back into that
state. A prolonged 2 or 3 years in that state, and wait and see what I can do!
I was detailed (by my own hand) more than once in life recently--recently being
the past 15 or 20-years. Haha, recently for me is a lifetime for others.

Okay, think! Leverage your vim spell-checking! Putting my en.utf-8.add file in
my vim repo. Time to make it public again. And I'll never need to rebuild my
personal word dictionary again.

Another thing I did was activate an Ubuntu 20.04 under WSL to be separate from
all my LXD work which is all centered around 18.04.

Now I can really run the wsl2lxd.bat file with no fear of loosing the ability
to edit my journals here and otherwise have a stable instance of Linux always
running.
