description: I successfully completed a project for a blog slicer app, demonstrating the power of ELPGD (Every Little Project Gets Done). I figured out how to put the sliced and diced version of my blog in the repo root, and have created a blog that I'm sure readers will find interesting. Read my post to learn more!

Okay, I did such good work on this blogslicer app. It's working in a repo
folder side-by-side with other repo folders, which is very important. It's easy
to get stuff to work relative to files within the same folder. But to get
something to step up **out** of its own folder, **over** and into another
folder and to work there doesn't always go as smoothly.

This is an important project for me because it opens the doors to the next and
the next project. It's an example of ELPID (every little project is doable). If
you can imagine it, it can get done... of course within a certain reason. You
can't raise a city into the clouds, but you can create a blog slice & dice
system in a few days that will change your life forever. It's a perfect case of
the releasing built-up potential that I'm always talking about.

I put a link to the one long journal file on this site's homepage. But now I
need links to the sliced & diced version. I need to create a blog index page...

Alright! A big breakthrough. You can't put stuff without the date file naming
convention into \_posts. Instead, you put it in the repo root, but with
something like this:

```markdown

layout: post
title: "Blog Index"
slug: blog

This is a test.
