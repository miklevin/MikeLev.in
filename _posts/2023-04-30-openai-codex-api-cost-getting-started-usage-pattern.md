Getting started with OpenAI Codex API and wondering what Cost getting started
usage pattern is? This was mine. I had a project in mind that had some back-log
of data to catch up on. I started out on "text-davinci-002" and processed the
backlog. I then realized how much better "text-davinci-003" was and adjusted my
prompts a bit and then reprocessed.

Once my job was "caught up", processing going forward is like 50 cents per day.
That's not terrible, paying someone about $.50 to read, summarize, describe and
keyword your blog post for you.
