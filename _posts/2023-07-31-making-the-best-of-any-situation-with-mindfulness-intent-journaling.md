description: Make the best of any situation with mindfulness, intent, and journaling. I've been journaling for 30 years and have developed a timeless solution that will help you in all walks of life. Create a Linux subsystem on whatever hardware you're using and get good at things there, and it can never be taken away.

        You can make the best of
        almost any situation, but it
        takes mindfulness and intent.
        This doesn't come easy.
        
        It comes best when journaling,
        but there are dozens of
        show-stoppers, from media
        selection to discipline.
        
        How many times have you
        started writing only to stall
        out?
        
        I've been journaling for 30
        years, and evolved a timeless
        solution that helps you in all
        walks of life. 
        
        You make a Linux subsystem on
        whatever hardware you're
        using, and that subsystem
        stays with you for life.
        
        Get good at things there, and
        it can never be taken away.
