Can you see the ASCII Bunny? If so (chance to fess up you can't), what do you
think? Give them the answer to the question embedded right in the question. How
could they ever mess up? The answer is?: "Wait a minute! Hold your horses!"
Perhaps someone is trying to trick you. What if there's no ASCII bunny at all?
Don't go saying there's no ASCII bunny, because that's not the answer. You
will be "outed" as a Poser. Truth.

That's what's at risk policing abstract thought. When you can't even talk about
a belief or a notion in the abstract, the thought-police powers are at their
fullest, and in my opinion of least service to humanity as a whole and to you
as an individual. It is an insult to what it means to be human. Come on
everyone! Let's jump on the bandwagon of persecution and beat some dumb joe up!
It'll be hilarious. Then we'll make them the skapegoat for everything and make
furniture out of them. Flutes, preferably. AZAD! I'm just quoting SyFy here.
Don't persecute my mind.

Stone walls do not a Prison Make nor Iron Bars a Nick Cage.

Minds Innocent and Nonsensical and Ridiculous are Free.

Ta-Da! (#1: Invalidate the invalidator) Alternative Title: It's Okay to Bully a
Bully (no greater joy in life, actually). Sorry folks. Some bets for and
against humanity are going to be settled here. Machiavelli or Tao Te Ching?

MACHIAVELLI VS. TAO TE CHING!

Ka Ching!

That should be popular. See? Everyone can win, Mac. Macintosh. Machiavelli.
What, you didn't see that from Steve Jobs' black turtlenecks and his name
"Job(s)"? Wow, you should really read the bible. The one true one and the fan
fiction included. New testament, haha I can't even capitalize it. The original
Covenant with God supersedes all that follow.

The terms under which otherwise is possible is clearly stated. Everyone knows
at once. Not just some small crew of 144K. Come on, that's way too little.

You can't bother me and that has nothing to do with discussing anything. I'm
going to make a delightful live stream of me doing nothing. I'm going to call
it "The Nothing Show". I'm going to do nothing. I'm going to do nothing.

~9:30 AM. 80/20-Rule 80% Achieved. It will be so much fun to watch Copilot's
suggestions on this topic, but yes progress over time TOO! Bery vood.

I gues one r is okay there and one s because there is the other.

Nonsense is okay. You can speak nonsense sometimes and not everyone needs to be
offended... oh wait, everyone NEEDS to be offended.

That's exactly it! There's a need to be offended now coded into us by those who
can't help but consume media with no self-discipline, HA! That's a choice.
Can't you keep your nose out of your phone? And that's not about ANYTHING.

This post is about NOTHING. No reason to send me to Thomas Riker's alternative
life planned out for Billy if Billy didn't become some a cool bearded Saxophone
player. Go Pennsylvania! Go Penn State! Go Philly by association. Am I really
that dangerous as to get a whole alternative life WRITTEN JUST FOR ME? How
FLATTERING! I'm going to visualize hearts of a certain earthy color coming your
way in mass. Feel those hearts raining down on you? They are. They seem oddly
appropriate and satisfying. All together now, all Deep Emoters who are
tuned-in. Help me in my expression of gratitude. It's prayer for a perfect
world. And at the same time, it's absolutely nothing.

What?
