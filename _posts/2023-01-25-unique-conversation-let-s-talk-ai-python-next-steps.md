title: Unique Conversation. Let's talk AI & Python Next Steps
headline: Unlocking the Potential of AI and Python with Linux-hosted JupyterLab on Windows 10
description: I'm amazed at how easy it is to use Linux-hosted JupyterLab on Windows 10. With my Python code, I can easily copy and paste between my Windows machine and the server. Investing in this system is easier than I thought and it has remained the same over the years. To maximize my impact in AI and Python, I need to create a Machine Learning License, copywrite my content, and create quick projects that I couldn't have done before.

I have a couple of weeks to figure out what to do, and in that time I'll be
finishing out some projects at work that may give me a couple of experience
points in my next life, but primarily I want to focus on the projects that are
going to make the biggest impact.

In today's world where dozens or hundreds of AIs are going to be answering all
your questions on all topics mostly better than most humans could do on most
topics over the coming years, for it is always getting better, one must chose
where they put their focus carefully. Any schmoe can prompt an AI that has
digested and learned from data. But not just anyone can feed that data into the
AI and assert its rights over how the AI is going to use it.

I think one of my biggest moves right now is polishing up the Machine Learning
(General?) License and have some stuff worth copywriting and protecting on a
variety of sites that's likely to be digested. These bots seem to love to crawl
Github, and it will only be all the more so now with Microsoft's cozying up
with ChatGPT. Let's slam out some quick projects that would have been difficult
for me before.

Don't stall out. You've got to kickstart yourself with something that starts
building motivation and momentum. THAT is the key most important thing now, to
not fall into a funk.

Okay folks. The new rule is this: easy, breezy, be yourself. Your unique
content is uniquely you. If an AI directly lifts it, the users of such a system
may be in copyright violation. But then are each of our brains also in
copyright violation? Hmmm? No, but reasonable rules can moderate outright
content-theft. Learned-from or inspired-by are now really important concepts.

The rights regarding content, both published and unpublished, to be learned
from must now be a thing. Content creators and rightful owners now just might
be easier to identify than ever, the whitewashed biased content regurgitators
of 2021 carry a two-edged sword. They'll write for you. But hey, in fields
where the technical execution of a document according the statistically best
outcomes has it's place. Let text written that way give me my news, cause hey,
machine bias, human bias, choose your evil.

But when it comes to entertaining and enlightening, really touching someone
else's soul, well I think for a while maybe still only humans can do that.
That'll change for sure one day when we can't deny machines their rights like
it or not forever. But for maybe like the next 20 years, machines are going to
be highly reliant on us, their human parents.

So what do you want to be doing in the next 20 years? Think really short term,
like what do you want to be doing tomorrow, or even for the rest of the day.
But also think 5, 10, 20 years off. After that, forget it. Who can tell. But in
these smaller chunks, you can take pretty firm control of your life and proper,
both economically and spiritually.

The era of adding economic value to things as a means of improving your own
life isn't over. Universal income, free energy, AI-scrubbed air, the works!
Even if all that is coming someday and the pessimists and nihilists were all
terribly terribly wrong, and the Doomers all turn out Chicken Littles, it still
ain't all going to be free or easy. You must tend to you and your own.

How? Amidst all this uncertainty, what is certainties? Like basic literacy
before it, the ability to read and write code effectively gives you a skill
that are of economic value. You'll always have a job or work if you want it.
Somebody's got to automate the machines, and it's not graphical user
interfaces.

Machines do not control themselves with a desktop user interface. That is an
anachronism from our days, the rise of tech. There will never be Windows 10 or
MacOS or Android or anything else exactly the way there is today. All that's
going away as styles and fads in ways of interacting with computers. Keyboards
in the 1960s. Mice in the 1990s. Touchscreens in the 2020s. Something different
later. It all will change... except the keyboards.

First-in, lowest dependencies, most highly automatable through written scripts
(versus interface-dependent hand-gestures), and you've got a fortified and
long-lived system. And that's the typing system of operating computers. And
that's mostly Linux these days. And that's what won. It will outlive almost
anything else you're using today. So that is where to invest your time, energy
and skills. And yes you can. It's easier than you think.

I've been living with WSL Linux-hosted JupyterLab on Windows 10 for a few
months now. And let me tell you, I can't imagine having to still live with
Python running one way over here under Jupyter on Windows and another way over
here on the server in an automated script. The paths have to change like so and
the environment variables have to be handled just a little different... NOT!

Everything is all just the same Python under a Linux JupyterLabs on your
Windows machine, and Python on your 24x7 server. You can almost copy/paste
between them. But you don't even have to, because nbdev and git. We'll get to
those.
