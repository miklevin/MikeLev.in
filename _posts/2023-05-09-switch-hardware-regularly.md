Murphy's law. I've been jumping hurdles over obstacles all morning. The latest
is that tokens aside, OpenAI is taking forever to process each prompt. It's
making me want to `Ctrl+C` break it, but of course that doesn't work cleanly on
Python. I've actually `Ctrl+C`'d it 3 times now, and each time it didn't stop
so I took it as a sign to let it finish. And it eventually got through all 3
prompts, but looking at what it wrote, it's like it didn't even read the
article. It must be the same encoding issue that broke the token counter.

Okay, write your own damn meta-fields on just this one post. Note the issue and
tuck it into the back of your head. OpenAI has encoding issues when the text
input gets funky. Maybe it's something in there from the new arrows I'm
inserting from the venn-nvim diagrams. That would be about right.

The big lessons:

- Switch your hardware regularly. There's so many reasons to do this!
- Do everything in a rudimentary way first. Don't jump to the power-tools right
  away.
- Don't rely on big 2-monitor situations. One monitor is enough, especially
  with virtual desktops which all modern OSes support. Learn to switch between
  them fast. Turning your head and re-orienting yourself is flow-breaking
  just like taking your hands off the keyboard.
- Do better at capturing ideas and shorting the feedback loop of actualizing a
  baby-step version and then iterating on it.
- Watch out for rabbit holes and back out when they're excessively deep, but
  then also know fake signals of deep rabbit holes. They're not all as deep as
  they appear at first. There's great skill in rabbit hole depth evaluation.
- When you're working well, you feel both the love and the intensity. This
  feeling modulates between wanting to give up and feeling like you're on top
  of the world. This is a good thing. Have fun on the roller coaster.
- Everyone's trying to be different, and everyone's trying to get your money.
  It's dependency injection. They're trying to make you depend on them. That's
  a whopping big part of the game. If you use dependencies, strive to make them
  interchangeable.

My "big lessons" are always evolving and changing. I have to start keeping a
distilled best version, and if I simply talk about the need to do that as I go,
it will naturally happen now with my new system, as it will get auto-keyworded
and grouped, and "natural sequences" will emerge, and these natural sequences
will be able to be summarized with prompts. Soon, I'll have my own
custom-trained GPT-like model that was just trained on my content. Not sure if
it will be OpenAI customized, as earlier experiments I was doing for work when
everything was proprietary. But now that I work for MOZ, such experiments are
just standard SEO deliverables we should be teaching people how to do, and I
can do them in the light. Woot!

Now off to the company's spring fling! Going to the city.
