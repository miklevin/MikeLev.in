title: Auto-Complete a.k.a. Intellisense Is Your Most Dangerous Dependency
headline: Don't Let Auto-Complete (Intellisense) Be Your Downfall - Learn to Code Without It!
description: As a coder, I'm warning people about the dangers of becoming too dependent on auto-complete (Intellisense). It's important to learn to code without relying on proprietary features and data-sets, or else you'll be left behind when the tools inevitably change. If you become too reliant on Intellisense, you won't be able to code without it, and you won't be able to keep up with the changing technology.

Learn to code.

Don't hard-wire your skills to proprietary features in proprietary products
leveraging proprietary data-sets.

If you have to steer your way down through an object-menu every time you want
to invoke a method of an object, then you're sunk. When the tools change as
they inevitably will, you'll have phantom limb syndrome and lose key abilities,
top-most among them is your competent and confident typing speed. You'll never
"internalize" the data-structures into your head.

Intellisense is Microsoft's word for code-completion that you'll find adding
pop-up menus as you type, with arrow-key command-line completion. Wow. Imagine
yourself becoming entirely dependent upon it to the point you couldn't code
without it.

Harsh news. That's exactly what's happening to you, and if you're not careful
the same dependency is going to happen with even just writing the code because
AI.

Power tools are great, but power tools powered exclusively by a vendor's
metered pump, not so much. You're locked-in. You're herded. And relearning the
shiny next new ain't so easy as things get more competitive and you get older.
