Okay, I've done tons of writing about the journaling system, but it's time to
get to the reasons why one journals. We process our thoughts, perchance to make
better considered, more deliberate decisions. The processing is the point.

Okay, so I've let myself get disorganized on the home front as I've thrown
myself into the digital world so intensely and deep for so many weeks
(months?). I've also been pebbled by life's little foibles. Just as when you
think you can take a big step forward, you're pushed back by a little thing.

It's time to overcome that. If you care, you do what it takes, and in this case
it takes pumping myself up with the motivation and to work straight through the
night -- or at least some portion of it that won't ruin me for tomorrow. And
even here as I decide to do it, I can feel the journal itself as a distraction
as it's nicer to be here than there.

But ***that's*** precisely what I have to fix. If your environment is not
working for you then it's working against you, and that's a double whammy for
the inverse reason as to why you want the snowball effect to accelerate your
accomplishments. A deteriorating environment is a snowball effect in the
opposite direction.

So plug in your headphones. Visualize some really big improvement you want to
make, and tackle it with the 80/20-rule. Don't run the Roomba in the middle of
the night, but learn your lesson from in in which you just start it running
then you scramble to get things out of its way. Ready, fire, aim! Not for all
things, but for organizing an environment for sure. Front-load the big wins.
