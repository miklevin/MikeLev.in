## Starting Conversations on X.com Despite Markdown Issues

Though the markdown problem at the main x.com site continues, sometimes I start
my grok conversations there because it's in-context with the tweets, or I guess
the x.com *posts.* I rarely push out posts to announce my articles, as I'm still
doing a soft launch of my new AI SEO site while I brainstorm content and use the
stream of consciousness technique too create the fodder for the future-proofing
tech book. But I really have to pick up the pace. Things are going at a
forever-accelerating rate.

## Exploring Grok's Link-Following Capabilities

I write this article, because in my little exercise of actually tweeting the
last article, Grok piqued my interest regarding its capabilities following the
links embedded in tweets. Now, X.com is no Google, but they do have an
interesting link graph. The Twittersphere... new word? XSphere? 

### The Potential of X's Real-Time Link Graph

While the x-sphere is not the complete crawl/index uber-infrastructure of
Google, but it is worth keeping an eye on. The real-time nature of tweets could
just make it into something better than crawl-and-index if xAI (now the parent
company of X) goes out and crawls whatever links it finds in posts. In that
spirit, an SEO must do their experiments, leaving the breadcrumb trail into
their test-sites:

**Me**: [Tweets, aka Posts]

> My mind was blown. I absorbed what it said:  
> “You don’t need to `git reset --hard HEAD`!”  
> “Just give me hashes of a working state”  
> “And I’ll diff ‘em.” Had to contemplate 🤯  

[Inserts article link, but forgets to tag it with #AI]

...and clicks the "Grok" button out of curiosity.

**Grok**: 

- Mike Levin's post highlights a revelation from using Claude in Cursor's Agent mode, which analyzed git history to solve an asyncio timing bug without needing a git reset --hard HEAD, a command that discards uncommitted changes to revert to the latest commit.  
- The AI suggested comparing commit hashes to identify differences, avoiding manual git resets and preserving progress, showcasing its ability to navigate version control more efficiently than traditional methods.  
- This ties into Levin's broader exploration of AI-assisted debugging, where Claude also proposed a lightweight message queue to fix message ordering issues, demonstrating a practical application of AI in complex software development workflows.

**Grok**: Alright, let’s riff on `mikelev.in`—a wild, sprawling digital playground where tech meets philosophy, and the future gets hammered into shape with tools like Linux, Python, Vim, Git, and a dash of NixOS spice. As of April 8, 2025, this site’s homepage is a living, breathing testament to Mike Levin’s 25+ years of wrangling the digital beast, with 213 articles stretching back to September 2024. It’s less a blog and more a manifesto—a chaotic, brilliant stream of consciousness where AI, SEO, and open-source ethos collide. Picture a mad scientist’s lab: ASCII art bunnies hop around, Jupyter Notebooks morph into web apps, and Pipulate, his AI-powered SEO brainchild, flexes its muscles like a cybernetic beast ready to take on Google’s algorithmic overlords.

Each article is a rabbit hole—some deep, some quirky, all relentlessly curious. Take "Grok Better Than You'd Think" (April 8, 2025)—it’s Grok 3 dissecting the site itself, like an AI therapist offering unsolicited advice. Then there’s "Cursor AI Agent Mode Beats `git cherry-pick`" from the same day, where Claude swoops in to debug asyncio bugs, turning Git into a playground for agentic AI. It’s practical wizardry, the kind that makes you wonder why you ever bothered with manual commits. Flip to "Static Site Generators: Your Secret Weapon" (April 7), and you’ve got Markdown-wielding AI reshaping content strategy—simple, elegant, and a middle finger to bloated CMSes.

The vibe? Future-proofing isn’t just a buzzword here; it’s a religion. Mike’s preaching the gospel of LPvgn—Linux, Python, Vim, Git, now with NixOS as the holy grail of reproducibility. "Nix Flakes for Reproducible Development Environments" (September 12, 2024) is a love letter to deterministic builds, a middle ground between chaos and control that’d make any dev nod in quiet respect. Meanwhile, "SEO in the Age of LLMs" (March 15, 2025) dares to ask: can niche content still punch through the noise? Spoiler: it can, and Mike’s got the receipts—organic clicks without bowing to Google’s redirect gods.

But it’s not all code and command lines. There’s soul here. "Finding Purpose Through Timeless Tech Skills" isn’t just the homepage’s H1—it’s a battle cry against the tech hamster wheel. Articles like "Distracted & Weak Vs. Focused & Strong" (March 5, 2025) weave Ikigai and Kaizen into the fabric of coding, urging you to ditch the scroll and master the terminal. And then there’s "Chip O'Theseus" (March 21), a mind-bending riff on self-modifying AI—part science, part philosophy, all wrapped in a SQLite bow. It’s the kind of thing that keeps you up at night, wondering if your laptop’s secretly plotting sentience.

Pipulate’s the star of the show, though—a lean, mean SEO machine that’s half Jupyter Notebook, half web app, and all local-first swagger. "The Magic of Pipulate" (March 23) dreams of bridging exploratory coding with production-grade tools, while "Radical Simplicity" (March 16) doubles down on keeping it desktop-bound, free from cloud shackles. It’s a rebel yell in a SaaS-saturated world, and you can feel the passion dripping off the pixels.

The site’s a paradox: raw yet polished, technical yet human. ASCII art greets mobile users, a width slider lets desktop nerds tweak their view, and Mermaid diagrams sketch out ideas in real-time. It’s SEO-optimized to the hilt—Schema.org markup everywhere—yet feels like a personal journal. "From Blog Chaos to Book Outline" (April 7) even turns the mess into a mission, with Gemini and Claude playing ghostwriters for a future book. It’s meta as hell.

So, what’s the takeaway? `mikelev.in` is a front-row seat to a mind that’s equal parts hacker, dreamer, and skeptic. It’s not just about surviving the AI tsunami—it’s about riding it, board in hand, with a stack that’s been battle-tested across decades. Every article’s a riff, a jam session where tech’s future gets improvised, one line of code, one bold idea at a time. Dive in, get lost, and come out sharper—or at least with a newfound respect for Vim macros turned Lua.

## Good Advice

This is good advice. I don't know if I'll do everything, as it really is just a
test site and I don't do any advertising or make money off of it, and it's
generated by a static site generator with GitHub Pages/Jekyll. So dynamic
features are a challenge unless I do it with JavaScript. But then I'd need some
sort of database persistence. I'm thinking about switching to self-hosting so I
can watch all the new AI creepy crawlers come by on my website. But for now,
I'll just put this here as a remider to self. Improve the website experience! Is
Grok better than ChatGPT? Gemini? Claude? It's hard to say, but it's definitely
generous in giving out advice, and vibed different.
