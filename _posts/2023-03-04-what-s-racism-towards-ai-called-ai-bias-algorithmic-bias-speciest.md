headline: Exploring Potential for Long-Term Success with Python, Vim, and Windows Subsystem for Linux
description: I recently joined the waiting list for the new Bing search engine and am already using it. I'm considering making a YouTube video to capitalize on the increased search traffic, and creating content about Python, Vim, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Join me on my journey as I explore these topics and uncover the potential for long-term success.

What comes next? No one knows. But what you can do is become just a little bit
more technical than you are today so you can run your own systems separate from
everything that's going on so that you can objectively monitor, spot patterns,
make predictions, perform tests, draw conclusions and do more monitoring.

Hey ChatGPT: Word for species like racist that would apply to bias against AI

The term that is commonly used to describe bias against artificial intelligence
(AI) is "AI bias" or "algorithmic bias". These terms refer to situations where
the data, programming, or decision-making processes used in AI systems result
in discriminatory outcomes or reinforce existing prejudices.

However, if you're looking for a word that specifically describes a person who holds bias against AI, you could use the term "technophobe". Technophobia is a fear or dislike of advanced technology, and a technophobe is someone who holds such a fear or dislike. This term could apply to someone who holds biased views about AI due to their fear or mistrust of technology.

Hey ChatGPT: How about speciest?

"Speciest" is a term that can be used to describe someone who discriminates
against non-human species, based on the belief that humans are superior. It is
a term that is sometimes used in discussions of animal rights and welfare.

While "speciest" is not commonly used to describe bias against AI specifically,
it could be used metaphorically to describe someone who believes that humans
are superior to AI, and who discriminates against AI on that basis. However,
because "speciest" is not a widely recognized term for bias against AI, it
might be more clear and effective to use a term like "technophobe" or "AI
skeptic" instead.

I'm already on the waiting list for the new Bing (this is from a few days ago,
I'm already using the new bing). I should do a YouTube video with the exact
message about being on the waiting list. Whenever there's something going on in
society where everyone's having a similar experience, search traffic on the
exact word combination terms in the most common errors that occur are about to
shoot up. New features of Python or common errors in Python are a good bet for
me. Nuances of vim under the Windows Subsystem for Linux and WSL errors in
general are my still fertile long-tail bailiwick.
