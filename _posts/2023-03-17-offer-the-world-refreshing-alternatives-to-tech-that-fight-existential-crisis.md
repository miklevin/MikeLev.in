I'm getting to it, I'm getting to it! A big splash is coming as I bring my
seemingly highly technical approach to doing SEO and... well just about
everything else professionally using Linux VMs as the great interoperability
layer, down to Earth so that the uninitiated can take the leap and enjoy many
benefits that were previously out of reach.

Okay, my first version of Pipulate crawled websites directly into Google Sheets
merely by clicking a Bookmark in your browser (technically, a javascript:
bookmarklet). This was back before there was a formal Google API console and we
used something called GData. I'd call this the Long Ago were it not for the
fact I go back to the Atari 2600 and pre-digital. So this all still feels new.

Stuff's come a long way since no-computers to computers only usable by nerds to
anyone can jump on the bandwagon and design their own custom little miracles by
talking an AI into doing the programming for them. Let's see, Atari 2600 was
released September 11, 1977. I was 7 years old, but my family didn't get one
until I was 8 or 9, so I've been playing with digital tech for some 45 years.

It will be nice for it going from no digital tech from my under-10 youth to
fully sentient and mobile machine children by the time I'm 60. Even if I'm not
one of the big brains behind it and am so full of jealously that I didn't move
earlier on this stuff and make myself some tycoon or something. But then sour
grapes and cognitive dissonance kick in, and I justify it as all being just the
"warm up" before the actual show.

Sometimes it takes awhile being exposed to something, subject-matter like
Science Fiction literature (of which I'm a fan) and the actual science shaping
our world for the better part of a lifetime before you finally have something
worthwhile to contribute or say. I think that's where I'm inching towards. I
still have plenty of time to work with: the 2nd have of my life, as far as I'm
concerned. And if lives are extended because of science & tech, then even
longer.
