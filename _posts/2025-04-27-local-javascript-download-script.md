title: "From CDN to Local: Managing JavaScript Dependencies in Pipulate Workflows"
permalink: /futureproof/local-javascript-download-script/
description: This morning, I tackled lingering issues with my Pipulate widget examples, realizing I needed a better way to manage JavaScript dependencies locally, so I built a download script and pulled in `marked.js`. Following that, leveraging extensive context fed to AI assistants Gemini and Claude, I researched and confirmed Prism.js as the right library, then planned its integration to add a crucial new workflow step for displaying syntax-highlighted code with a copy button, setting the stage for the next phase of focused development before tackling client work.

## Getting Started with Pipulate: Enhancing Workflows with Code Visualization

This article delves into the practical development process of enhancing a specific web application called "Pipulate." Pipulate utilizes a "workflow" system, essentially sequences of automated steps, and the author is focused on improving the visual components, known as "widgets," within these workflows. The main challenge discussed is adding the capability to display computer code (specifically JavaScript) within a workflow step, complete with syntax highlighting (colors to make the code readable) and an easy way to copy it.

The text provides a real-time glimpse into the developer's thought process, showing how they identify problems with existing widgets, decide to manage external code libraries (like those for Markdown formatting or code highlighting) locally rather than relying on external servers, and even create custom tools for this purpose. It also highlights the increasing role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like Gemini and Claude in modern software development, showcasing how the author uses them for research, code generation, and refining implementation plans. This offers a window into solving specific technical challenges in web development, managing project dependencies, and collaborating with AI coding assistants.

## Early Morning Development Planning

How are we going to use this precious focus day? It's coming up on 6:00 AM on
Sunday. I had a good 7 hours or so of sleep. Yesterday, I finished the widget
template work. I've got solid widget templates — although they are of the 2-step
combined variety which may not be copy/paste ready for the most common use case.
And the rich grids do look like ASCII text. I mean they look like ASCII text
grids. They're rendering properly as if they were console text, and not HTML. I
have the mermaid diagrams working correctly, but not generic markdown. And the
plain text widget isn't showing it's contents after a submit. And when the
workflow is in locked mode, none of the widgets are showing. And even in
unlocked mode, the widget previews should not show the original input AND
rendered output which is a bit confusing and space-wasting. So, is the widget
workflow example really finished?

## AI-Assisted Workflow Development Strategy

Okay, so for all these things really the only one we don't want to do in
`60_widget_exmples.py` is un-bundling the combined steps, and I think perhaps
only because that would be too much of a refactor. The immediate work is
preparing it for AI-assisted copy/paste that can do the unbundling into a more
stretched-out linear workflow when necessary. At this point in history, and with
the Workflows WET as they are, it is unlikely that these things will be put
together by anything other than AI from now forward. Wet Workflows I do believe
may be a perfect sweet spot for AI. Make a very novel system that provides all
sorts of competitive advantages with sufficient contrarian anti-pattern thinking
so as to create quite a moat for humans — but provide plenty of template
examples to help AIs immediately "get it" (overcoming the contrarian
anti-pattern moat), and provide effective assistance.

## Integrating MarkedJS for Markdown Support

I don't think I actually need to add Markdown as a step here, but I should make
the Mermaid step easily switch-able to markdown. Okay, the AI assistant wanted
to use the [markedjs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) library, so let's get
that local! The CDN location is: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js

## Creating a JavaScript Library Download Script

Alright, so of course we could do "making it local" manually with the browser,
visiting that URL in the browser and right-clicking or `Ctrl`+`s`'ing it and
using the requester to save it into location. But I make enough normally CDN
hosted or NPM-installed JavaScript libraries local in Pipulate that it's time to
make a Python download helper script, both to get the new ones and to refresh
the existing list. I want to program it as mostly straight forward initially as
I can so the project itself doesn't become a rabbit hole. But I think it is an
accelerator because there's going to be more and more of these JavaScript
library based visualizers (and eventually interactive widgets through AnyWidget)
that I want to at least get the ball rolling.

## Project Structure Considerations

Okay, at first pass this seems like just something to go into
`pipulate/precursors`. That location is intended for Jupyter Notebooks and
executable Python scripts that are Workflow precursors. In other words, things
on their way to becoming Pipulate Workflows — and not helper scripts in general,
but I have no helper script location and don't want spreading this kind of code
over multiple locations. If it's not core or a plugin, it goes in precursors for
now — even helper scripts that may never become Workflows. But who knows? If
it's Python and it takes parameters, maybe it should be a Workflow. The only
reason not at the moment is because of how such scripts are tied into core. It's
on the instantiation of the main `app` webserver object:

```python
app, rt, (store, Store), (profiles, Profile), (pipeline, Pipeline) = fast_app(
    DB_FILENAME,
    exts='ws',
    live=True,
    default_hdrs=False,
    hdrs=(
        Meta(charset='utf-8'),
        Link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/pico.css'),
        Script(src='/static/htmx.js'),
        Script(src='/static/fasthtml.js'),
        Script(src='/static/surreal.js'),
        Script(src='/static/script.js'),
        Script(src='/static/Sortable.js'),
        Script(src='/static/mermaid.min.js'),
        Script(src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js'),
        Script(src='/static/widget-scripts.js'),
        create_chat_scripts('.sortable'),
        Script(type='module')
    ),
    store={
        "key": str,
        "value": str,
        "pk": "key"
    },
    profile={
        "id": int,
        "name": str,
        "real_name": str,
        "address": str,
        "code": str,
        "active": bool,
        "priority": int,
        "pk": "id"
    },
    pipeline={
        "pkey": str,
        "app_name": str,
        "data": str,
        "created": str,
        "updated": str,
        "pk": "pkey"
    }
)
```

## Understanding Pipulate's Core Architecture

Wow, so much of the Pipulate system can be gleaned right there! There's the
FastHTML pattern that pops out a `rt` object to take the place of `app.route`,
there's the server-side cookie system (store), the profile-switcher and the
pipline database objects — schema and all! There's the activating of websockets,
live-reloading developer mode, the turning-off of all FastHTML's default headers
and most importantly to this discussion, the turning-on of my own. For anyone
actually following along, this can all be found in
[server.py](https://github.com/miklevin/pipulate/blob/main/server.py#L1987)
(latest) or precisely
[here](https://github.com/miklevin/pipulate/blob/54be1ec2fc872cbc01bb3522407295f57fb7ab3f/server.py#L1987)
(as of time of writing) in GitHub.

## Future Plans for JavaScript Library Management

So to avoid rabbit holes, I'm just going to make the script install the latest
version from the CDN into `pipulate/static`, but we can see how in the future
I'll likely maintain a registry of the external JavaScript libraries that
Pipulate is able to use in Workflows and automatically include them. But we're
going for simple initially.

## Requesting a JavaScript Download Script

**Me**: Hey Gemini, write me a simple Python script that fetches
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js and saves it into
/home/mike/repos/pipulate/static

**Gemini 2.5 Experimental**:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

JS_URL = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js"

# Target directory to save the file
# IMPORTANT: Adjust this path if it's different on your system
TARGET_DIR = Path("/home/mike/repos/pipulate/static")

# --- Main Script Logic ---
def download_js_library(url: str, save_dir: Path):
    """

    try:
        # Ensure the target directory exists, create if it doesn't
        save_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        print(f"Target directory: {save_dir}")

        # Extract the filename from the URL
        filename = Path(url).name
        if not filename:
            print(f"Error: Could not determine filename from URL: {url}", file=sys.stderr)

        sys.exit(1)
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error saving file to {save_path}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # --- Installation Note ---
    # Ensure you have the 'requests' library installed:
    # pip install requests
    # --- ---

    print("Starting JavaScript library download...")
    download_js_library(JS_URL, TARGET_DIR)
    print("Download process finished.")
```

---

...I run it:

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/pipulate/precursors]$ python install_static_library.py 
Starting JavaScript library download...
Target directory: /home/mike/repos/pipulate/static
Attempting to download 'marked.min.js' from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js...

```

...and now I change this line:

```python
Script(src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js'),
```

...to this:

```python
Script(src='/static/marked.min.js'),
```

...and finally, I commit it to the repo:

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/pipulate]$ git add precursors/install_static_library.py static/marked.min.js

[mike@nixos:~/repos/pipulate]$ git commit -am "Added static library installer and the markedjs library"

 create mode 100644 precursors/install_static_library.py
 create mode 100644 static/marked.min.js

[mike@nixos:~/repos/pipulate]$ git push
```

And that is how we include a new static JavaScript library in Pipulate. Now it's
time to move onto the `60_widget_exmples.py` refinements. But I need to do so
with a plan so all of today doesn't disappear. I have to leave enough time for
some client work that I bumped to Monday because of all of this. Ideally, I'm
making workflows that directly help with the client work. Generally, yes but in
this case no. And so, what I really need to do is blast through this difficult
focus-requiring work that changes everything forever-forward by virtue of giving
me an example everyone at the office can sink their teeth into while still
having enough energy left over to do the client work.

## Prioritizing the Mermaid Diagram Step for Maximum Impact

Hmm. Okay, to that end making the Mermaid Diagram step able to be swapped out
easily with other JavaScript visualizers is actually the most important step,
because the changes-everything Workflow I want to distribute has a piece of
JavaScript code as the end deliverable. It's not the execution of JavaScript in
the widget as Step 3 actually demonstrates in the widget examples, but rather
the actual displaying of preferably syntax color-coded JavaScript, and
preferably with a simple click-to-copy link to get the JavaScript code into your
OS copy-buffer for easy pasting elsewhere.

## Leveraging the Two-Step Approach for Parameter Collection

Oh, and finally the input for the JavaScript visualization is some web form
parameters! So it actually can take advantage of the 2-step approach that AI
collapsed into a single-step for the widget examples! Wow so toggling back and
forth between "edit mode" and "display mode" for a particular step (i.e. hitting
the "revert" button for that step) will show you the interface to collect
input-parameters for that visualization step! Wow, this is potentially quite
powerful in the way it shortens and makes clearer potentially long multi-step
workflows where there's a lot of collecting of arguments for input parameters.
To change the final parameters that control the displaying of the
copy/paste-able JavaScript, you just hit revert staying on the same step, change
some numbers without having to look at the JavaScript (which is actually
programmatically generated on the back-end as the final widget output display),
submit and voilà!

## Identifying the Right JavaScript Visualization Library

Okay, so I need to identify what JavaScript library is going to do the
visualization and the copy/paste button (preferably they come together as a
package). Generally I turn one of these articles into a single super-prompt for
implementation, but there's no reason I can't do multiple super-prompt
submissions to Gemini or Grok along the way. Let's put the context together for
our *context foo*...

```python
FILES_TO_INCLUDE = """\
README.md
flake.nix
server.py
plugins/60_widget_examples.py
.cursorrules
/home/mike/repos/MikeLev.in/_posts/2025-04-26-htmx-widgets-ai-implementation.md
/home/mike/repos/MikeLev.in/_posts/2025-04-26-llm-architecture-ai-collaboration-coding-workflows.md
/home/mike/repos/MikeLev.in/_posts/2025-04-26-fasthtml-htmx-javascript-rendering.md
""".splitlines()[:-1]  # Remove the last empty line
```

This is the first time I've included 3 articles in the context foo. And the way
I feed this current article name on the command-line, that makes it FOUR
articles establishing background story-telling context, in addition to the
various files from the repo that give the code context. At this time, I'm forced
to give this particular article a name, moving it out of my ad hoc writing
system and into the Jekyll blogging system, however I don't really know how I'm
going to name the file and such. You know how sometimes you're too in the weeds
to see the big picture? So that's where I do an AI analysis of the article,
usually at the end to help with final details. But there's no reason I can't do
it now... [Inserted at bottom]

## Articulating The Prompt

Okay, so now with that AI analysis of this article in-hand, I can articulate the
next prompt. Hey Gemini! I know you're going to be seeing a whole lot of stuff
as you scan this, including the article analysis below that makes it seem like a
finished article. But it's not! This is where the actual prompt is. 

### Priorities

I discuss a lot of clean up in `60_widget_exmples.py` in the ways suggested in
this article, but it's all too much to mix into one prompt. Let's set
priorities.

- LOW: Rich Library rendering. This can be deferred
- LOW: Using `<pre>` tags for step 1 output widget rendering
- LOW: Showing rendered widgets on locked workflows 
- LOW: Removal of double-display of original input rendered output of widgets
- HIGH: Selection of JavaScript library for JavaScript code rendering
- HIGH: Figuring out how the copy button will let copying raw JavaScript
- HIGH: Adding a step that mimics the Mermaid step but for JavaScript display

### The Prompt

So in other words, I need the Mermaid Diagram step 4 to be able to be swapped
out easily with a as-yet unidentified JavaScript library that lets you actually
display syntax color-coded JavaScript (and other languages?) with an
accompanying "copy" button to let you copy the raw JavaScript (sans color-coding
syntax) into your OS copy buffer. It can be added as a Step 5 to keep things
simple, keeping the Mermaid Diagram step in location for reference.

Once the JavaScript library is identified, it will be easy to incorporate it
into the local system given the work already done, so please focus on actually
doing the research to identify the correct JavaScript library for the task of
displaying color-coded JavaScript to the user in the widget and making it easy
for the user to copy that JavaScript into their copy-buffer.

### The Precise Prompt

Identify the best JavaScript library and way to do the copy function, and give
me an implementation plan focusing on the Workflow Step 5, please and thank you!

## Context Foo

Here is the abbreviated output of the context foo prompt. What actually happens
is that 72K token prompt with all the XML-wrapping is plopped into my OS
copy-buffer so that I can paste it into the prompt box of the Web versions of
the frontier AI models. As of this writing, only Gemini and Grok can handle a
submit of this size. On the ChatGPT-front, I'd have to go down to 4o-mini, and
so only Gemini and Grok's responses are included below.

## Gemini 2.5 Experimental Responds

**Gemini**: Okay, I've processed the context, including the new article discussing the local JavaScript download script and the clear priority on adding a code visualization step.

Here's the research and implementation plan focused on adding **Step 5: Code Visualization Widget** to `plugins/60_widget_examples.py`.

### Research: JavaScript Library for Code Highlighting & Copying

Several excellent libraries exist for syntax highlighting. We need one that's relatively easy to integrate with dynamic content loading (HTMX) and provides or facilitates a copy-to-clipboard feature.

1.  **Prism.js:**
    * **Pros:** Lightweight, extensible, good language support, semantic class names. Has official plugins for line numbers, copy button, etc. Works well with dynamically loaded content via `Prism.highlightAll()` or `Prism.highlightElement()`.
    * **Cons:** Requires separate CSS theme file. Plugins might add complexity.
    * **Copying:** Has an official [Copy to Clipboard Button](https://prismjs.com/plugins/copy-to-clipboard/) plugin.

2.  **Highlight.js:**
    * **Pros:** Automatic language detection, wide language support, simple API (`hljs.highlightAll()`, `hljs.highlightElement()`).
    * **Cons:** Can be larger than Prism depending on languages included. Automatic detection can sometimes be wrong.
    * **Copying:** No official built-in copy button, but easy to implement manually using the library's structure and the browser's Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText`). Many third-party integrations exist.

3.  **CodeMirror:**
    * **Pros:** Full-featured code *editor* library, excellent highlighting, many addons.
    * **Cons:** Significant overkill for just *displaying* code. Much larger and more complex integration.
    * **Copying:** Trivial, as it's an editor.

**Recommendation:**

**Prism.js** seems like the best fit. It's designed for highlighting static code blocks, is lightweight, has good performance with dynamic content, and importantly, has an official, well-documented **Copy to Clipboard Button plugin**. This reduces the amount of custom JavaScript we need to write for the copy functionality.

### Implementation Plan: Step 5 - Code Visualization Widget (Prism.js)

**Goal:** Add a step that takes code (e.g., JavaScript) as input, displays it with syntax highlighting using Prism.js, and provides a button to copy the raw code.

---

#### **Area 1: Required Changes**

1.  **`plugins/60_widget_examples.py`:**
    * **`__init__`:**
        * Add a new `Step` definition for `step_05` *before* the 'finalize' step:
            ```python
            Step(
                id='step_05',
                done='code_content',
                show='Code Visualization',
                refill=True,
            ),
            ```
        * Update `self.steps_indices` to reflect the new step.
        * Add route registrations for `/widgets/step_05` (GET) and `/widgets/step_05_submit` (POST).
        * Add default messages for `step_05` to `self.step_messages`.
    * **`step_05(self, request)` (GET Handler):**
        * Implement logic similar to `step_04`: check finalization, check if step is complete (using `step_data.get('code_content')`), check for revert target.
        * If finalized: Show locked card.
        * If complete and not reverting: Create the Prism widget container (similar to `step_04_submit` but using existing `code_content`) and return it with the next step trigger (`finalize`). Use `pip.widget_container`. Crucially, this widget *also* needs the `HX-Trigger` to activate Prism highlighting and the copy button *after* it's rendered from saved state.
        * If incomplete or reverting: Show an input form (`Textarea`) asking for code input. Pre-populate with example JavaScript or the previous value if `refill=True`. Provide context about the expected input.
    * **`step_05_submit(self, request)` (POST Handler):**
        * Get `code_content` from the form data.
        * Validate the input (ensure it's not empty).
        * Save the `code_content` to the workflow state using `pip.update_step_state`.
        * Generate a unique `widget_id` (e.g., `prism-widget-{pipeline_id}-{step_id}`).
        * Create the HTML structure for Prism.js:
            ```python
            # Important: Use the correct language class (e.g., 'language-javascript')
            # The 'data-prismjs-copy' attribute is used by the Prism copy button plugin
            prism_widget_content = Pre(
                Code(user_val, cls="language-javascript"), # Use user_val (raw code)
                # Attributes for the copy button plugin
                data_prismjs_copy="Copy raw code",
                data_prismjs_copy_error="Press Ctrl+C to copy",
                data_prismjs_copy_success="Code copied!",
                # Add any other necessary attributes or wrappers
                cls="line-numbers" # Optional: Add line numbers plugin class
            )
            # Container with unique ID
            widget_container_div = Div(prism_widget_content, id=widget_id)
            ```
        * Use `pip.widget_container` passing the `widget_container_div` as the `widget` argument.
        * Create the `HTMLResponse` containing the rendered `widget_container` and the next step trigger (`finalize`).
        * **Add `HX-Trigger` header:** This is critical to tell the client-side JS to initialize Prism *after* this new content is swapped in.
            ```python
            response.headers["HX-Trigger"] = json.dumps({
                "initializePrism": {
                     # We might not even need a targetId if Prism.highlightAll() works,
                     # but passing it is safer for targeted highlighting.
                    "targetId": widget_id
                }
            })
            ```
        * Return the `HTMLResponse`.

2.  **`server.py`:**
    * **`fast_app` call / `hdrs` tuple:**
        * Add the Prism.js core library JS file. Use the local copy strategy:
            * Run `python precursors/install_static_library.py` (modified to download Prism files) or manually download `prism.js` to `static/`.
            * Add `Script(src='/static/prism.js')` to `hdrs`.
        * Add the Prism.js CSS theme file:
            * Download a theme (e.g., `prism-okaidia.css`) to `static/`.
            * Add `Link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/prism-okaidia.css')` to `hdrs`.
        * Add the Prism.js **Copy to Clipboard Button** plugin JS file:
            * Download `prism-copy-to-clipboard.min.js` to `static/`.
            * Add `Script(src='/static/prism-copy-to-clipboard.min.js')` to `hdrs`.
        * Add the Prism.js **Line Numbers** plugin JS file (optional but recommended):
            * Download `prism-line-numbers.min.js` to `static/`.
            * Add `Script(src='/static/prism-line-numbers.min.js')` to `hdrs`.
        * Add the Prism.js **Line Numbers** plugin CSS file (required if using the plugin):
            * Download `prism-line-numbers.css` to `static/`.
            * Add `Link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/prism-line-numbers.css')` to `hdrs`.
    * **`precursors/install_static_library.py` (Optional but Recommended):**
        * Modify this script to accept URL and target directory as arguments or manage a list of libraries to download, including Prism core, theme, and plugins.

3.  **`static/widget-scripts.js` (or `static/script.js`):**
    * **Add Event Listener for Prism Initialization:** Add a listener for the `initializePrism` trigger sent from `step_05_submit`.
        ```javascript
        document.body.addEventListener('initializePrism', function(evt) {
            console.log('initializePrism trigger received:', evt.detail);
            const targetId = evt.detail.targetId;
            const targetElement = targetId ? document.getElementById(targetId) : document;

            if (targetElement && typeof Prism !== 'undefined') {
                // Use setTimeout to ensure rendering occurs after potential DOM settling
                setTimeout(() => {
                    console.log('Highlighting Prism elements within:', targetElement);
                    // Highlight elements within the specific target or globally if no targetId
                    Prism.highlightAllUnder(targetElement);
                    // If using highlightAll, it might be simpler: Prism.highlightAll();
                    // Note: Prism plugins (like copy button, line numbers) often
                    // initialize automatically when highlightAll/highlightAllUnder runs.
                    // Double-check Prism plugin docs if they need explicit calls.
                }, 100); // Small delay might be needed
            } else {
                console.error('Prism library or target element not found for initialization.');
            }
        });
        ```
    * **Copy Functionality:** The Prism "Copy to Clipboard" plugin should handle this automatically when `Prism.highlightAllUnder` or `Prism.highlightAll` is called, provided the HTML structure includes the `data-prismjs-copy` attributes as shown above. No extra JS should be needed for the *basic* copy function.

---

#### **Area 2: Integration Strategy**

1.  **Integration with Existing Functionality:**
    * Step 5 slots naturally into the existing workflow before 'finalize'.
    * It reuses the established patterns for GET/POST handlers, state management (`pip.update_step_state`), UI rendering (`pip.widget_container`), and client-side interaction (`HX-Trigger`).
2.  **Patterns and Conventions:**
    * Follow the `Step` namedtuple pattern.
    * Use `pipulate` helper methods consistently.
    * Leverage HTMX for UI updates and triggers.
    * Use `widget_container` for consistent display.
    * Use `HX-Trigger` + client-side listener for activating JS on dynamic content.
    * Load JS libraries/CSS globally via `hdrs` in `server.py`, using local static files.
    * Use `to_xml()` correctly for `HTMLResponse`.
3.  **Backward Compatibility:**
    * Adding a new optional step to an existing workflow plugin is backward compatible. Old saved states won't have `step_05` data, but the workflow will proceed correctly.
    * Adding Prism JS/CSS files to `hdrs` is additive and shouldn't affect other parts of the application unless there are unlikely CSS class collisions.
    * Adding the new JS event listener is additive.

---

#### **Area 3: Implementation Plan**

1.  **Install Prism:**
    * Use the modified `install_static_library.py` or manually download:
        * `prism.js`
        * A Prism CSS theme (e.g., `prism-okaidia.css`)
        * `prism-copy-to-clipboard.min.js`
        * `prism-line-numbers.min.js` (optional)
        * `prism-line-numbers.css` (optional)
    * Save them to the `static/` directory.
    * Update the `hdrs` tuple in `server.py` to include these new files.
2.  **Implement Step 5 Server-Side (`60_widget_examples.py`):**
    * Add the `Step` definition.
    * Implement the `step_05` GET handler (input form logic).
    * Implement the `step_05_submit` POST handler (validation, state saving, creating Prism HTML structure, returning `HTMLResponse` with `widget_container` and `HX-Trigger`).
3.  **Implement Client-Side Listener (`static/widget-scripts.js`):**
    * Add the `initializePrism` event listener using `document.body.addEventListener`.
    * Include `console.log` statements for debugging.
    * Implement the call to `Prism.highlightAllUnder(targetElement)` within the listener (inside a `setTimeout` if needed).
4.  **Test and Refine:**
    * Run the workflow. Submit code in Step 5.
    * **Verify:** Code is displayed with syntax highlighting. The copy button appears and functions correctly. Line numbers appear (if enabled). Check the browser console for errors.
    * Test reverting to Step 5 – ensure the highlighting and copy button are re-initialized correctly via the GET handler's `HX-Trigger`.
    * Test the finalized view for Step 5.

**Key Milestones:**

* **M1:** Prism.js library and plugins successfully downloaded locally and included via `hdrs`.
* **M2:** Step 5 server-side logic (`step_05`, `step_05_submit`) implemented, returning the correct HTML structure and `HX-Trigger`.
* **M3:** Client-side `initializePrism` listener implemented and successfully triggering `Prism.highlightAllUnder`.
* **M4:** Code submitted in Step 5 displays with syntax highlighting and a functional copy-to-clipboard button.

**Potential Challenges:**

* **Prism Initialization Timing:** Getting `Prism.highlightAllUnder` to run at the *exact* right moment after HTMX swap might require adjusting the `setTimeout` delay or potentially using `htmx:afterSwap` event if the custom trigger proves unreliable.
* **CSS Conflicts:** The Prism theme CSS could potentially conflict with Pico.css or custom styles.
* **Copy Button Plugin:** Ensure the copy button plugin is correctly included and activated by the `highlightAllUnder` call. Its interaction depends on the HTML structure (`data-prismjs-copy` attributes).
* **Large Code Blocks:** Performance of highlighting very large code blocks on the client side could be a concern, though unlikely for typical use cases.

This plan focuses specifically on the high-priority task of adding the code visualization widget using Prism.js and its copy-to-clipboard plugin, leveraging the patterns established by the Mermaid widget integration.

## Grok 3 Responds

**Grok 3**: Below is a detailed response to your query, providing specific implementation suggestions for adding new widget types to Pipulate workflows, as outlined in the article within the provided context. The response is structured according to the requested XML format, focusing on practical changes while maintaining the architectural integrity of the Pipulate codebase.

---

## Final Solution (not)

### Required Changes

- **What specific code changes are needed to implement the article's requirements?**
  - **New Workflow Plugin (`plugins/60_widget_examples.py`):**
    - Create a new file `plugins/60_widget_examples.py` using existing templates (e.g., `500_hello_workflow.py`).
    - Define a `WidgetExamples` class with:
      - `APP_NAME = "widgets"`
      - `DISPLAY_NAME = "Widget Examples"`
      - `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE = "This workflow demonstrates different types of widgets: a simple HTMX widget, a Rich table widget, a JavaScript execution widget, and a Markdown renderer widget."`
      - `TRAINING_PROMPT = "Demonstrates various widget types in Pipulate Workflows"`
    - Implement four steps within the `__init__` method:
      - **Step 1: Simple HTMX Widget** - Basic input form and static HTML display.
      - **Step 2: Rich Table Widget** - Input JSON data, generate an HTML table using the Rich library.
      - **Step 3: JavaScript Execution Widget** - Input JavaScript code, execute it client-side post-HTMX injection.
      - **Step 4: Markdown Renderer Widget** - Input Markdown text, render it using `marked.js`.
    - Define corresponding `step_XX` (GET) and `step_XX_submit` (POST) methods for each step.
  - **Step Implementations:**
    - **Step 1 (Simple HTMX):**
      - `step_01`: Render a form with a `Textarea` for user input.
      - `step_01_submit`: Validate input, store it in state using `pipulate.update_step_state`, return a `Div` with the input content and a next-step trigger (`hx-get`).
    - **Step 2 (Rich Table Widget):**
      - `step_02`: Render a form with a `Textarea` for JSON input.
      - `step_02_submit`:
        - Validate JSON input.
        - Use the Rich library (`rich.table.Table`, `rich.console.Console`) to generate an HTML table.
        - Wrap the HTML in a `Div` with `NotStr` and `_raw=True` to preserve raw HTML.
        - Use `pipulate.widget_container` to display below the revert control.
        - Return an `HTMLResponse` with `to_xml()` conversion.
    - **Step 3 (JavaScript Execution Widget):**
      - `step_03`: Render a form with a `Textarea` for JavaScript code.
      - `step_03_submit`:
        - Validate input.
        - Store in state.
        - Create a `Div` with a unique ID for the widget content.
        - Use `pipulate.widget_container` to encapsulate the widget.
        - Return an `HTMLResponse` with an `HX-Trigger` header to execute the JavaScript post-injection.
    - **Step 4 (Markdown Renderer Widget):**
      - `step_04`: Render a form with a `Textarea` for Markdown input.
      - `step_04_submit`:
        - Validate input.
        - Store in state.
        - Create a `Div` with a unique ID and the Markdown content.
        - Use `pipulate.widget_container` for display.
        - Return an `HTMLResponse` with an `HX-Trigger` header to trigger `marked.js` rendering.
  - **Server Modifications (`server.py`):**
    - Update the `hdrs` tuple in the `fast_app` call to include:
      - `Script(src='/static/marked.min.js')` (already local per context).
    - Ensure `widget_container` in the `Pipulate` class handles raw HTML correctly by preserving `NotStr` content with `_raw=True`.
  - **Static JavaScript (`static/script.js`):**
    - Add event listeners for `HX-Trigger` events:
      - `"runJavaScript"`: Execute user-provided JavaScript on a specific DOM element.
      - `"renderMarkdown"`: Use `marked.parse()` to render Markdown content into a target element.

- **Which existing components need to be modified or extended?**
  - **`Pipulate` Class (`server.py`):**
    - Extend `widget_container` to ensure it correctly renders raw HTML from Step 2 without escaping (already supports this with proper use of `NotStr` and `_raw=True`).
  - **`server.py`:**
    - Modify the `fast_app` call’s `hdrs` tuple to include `marked.min.js` (already updated per context).
  - **`static/script.js`:**
    - Extend to include new global functions or event listeners for `HX-Trigger` events triggered by Steps 3 and 4.

- **What new components or patterns need to be introduced?**
  - **New Workflow Plugin:** `60_widget_examples.py` as a standalone plugin.
  - **Rich Library Integration:** Import and use `rich` for HTML table generation in Step 2.
  - **JavaScript Execution Pattern:** A pattern using `HX-Trigger` headers to execute JavaScript post-HTMX injection, ensuring reliable timing and scope.
  - **Client-Side Rendering Pattern:** Use `HX-Trigger` with `marked.js` for Markdown rendering, introducing a reusable approach for JS library initialization.

### Integration Strategy

- **How should these changes be integrated with existing functionality?**
  - Use the existing plugin architecture by placing `60_widget_examples.py` in the `plugins` directory for automatic discovery.
  - Leverage `Pipulate` helper methods (`read_state`, `update_step_state`, `widget_container`, `revert_control`) for state management and UI consistency.
  - Integrate HTMX for dynamic updates, maintaining the chain of `hx-get` triggers for step progression.
  - Use `HX-Trigger` headers for client-side JavaScript actions, aligning with the pattern seen in `90_roadmap.py` for Mermaid.js.

- **What existing patterns or conventions should be followed?**
  - **Local-First Design:** All processing occurs locally, with JavaScript libraries stored in `static`.
  - **Server-Side State:** Store widget data in the `pipeline` table as JSON blobs via `Pipulate`.
  - **FastHTML Rendering:** Convert all FastHTML objects to strings with `to_xml()` for HTTP responses.
  - **HTMX Updates:** Use `hx-post`, `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-swap` for UI interactions.
  - **Plugin-Based Architecture:** Keep the core minimal, extending functionality via plugins.

- **How can we ensure backward compatibility?**
  - Adding `60_widget_examples.py` as a new plugin does not affect existing workflows.
  - Including `marked.min.js` in `hdrs` is additive and won’t disrupt current functionality unless naming conflicts occur (unlikely with standard libraries).
  - Updates to `static/script.js` should be additive (new functions/listeners), preserving existing behavior.

### Implementation Plan

- **What’s the recommended order for implementing these changes?**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Create `plugins/60_widget_examples.py` from a template (e.g., `500_hello_workflow.py`).
     - Define the four steps in `__init__`.
  2. **Step 1 (Simple HTMX):**
     - Implement `step_01` and `step_01_submit`.
     - Test basic form submission and state persistence.
  3. **Step 2 (Rich Table):**
     - Add `rich` to `requirements.txt`.
     - Implement `step_02` and `step_02_submit` with Rich table generation.
     - Test HTML rendering within `widget_container`.
  4. **Step 4 (Markdown Renderer):**
     - Verify `marked.min.js` in `hdrs` (already done).
     - Add `renderMarkdown` listener to `static/script.js`.
     - Implement `step_04` and `step_04_submit` with `HX-Trigger`.
     - Test Markdown rendering.
  5. **Step 3 (JavaScript Execution):**
     - Add `runJavaScript` listener to `static/script.js`.
     - Implement `step_03` and `step_03_submit` with `HX-Trigger`.
     - Test JavaScript execution.
  6. **Finalize and Test:**
     - Test the full workflow, including revert and finalize states.

- **What are the key milestones or checkpoints?**
  - **Milestone 1:** Step 1 submits and displays content correctly.
  - **Milestone 2:** Step 2 renders a Rich table as HTML, not text.
  - **Milestone 3:** Step 4 renders Markdown using `marked.js`.
  - **Milestone 4:** Step 3 executes JavaScript post-injection.
  - **Milestone 5:** Entire workflow completes with all widgets functioning.

- **What potential challenges or risks need to be addressed?**
  - **JavaScript Execution Timing:** Ensure `HX-Trigger` events fire after the DOM is updated. Use timeouts or `htmx:afterSwap` if needed.
  - **Raw HTML Handling:** Verify Rich table HTML isn’t escaped; use `NotStr` and `_raw=True` correctly with `to_xml()`.
  - **Library Loading:** Confirm `marked.min.js` loads correctly from `static` and is available for Step 4.
  - **Scope Issues:** JavaScript in Step 3 must target the correct widget container; use unique IDs to avoid conflicts.

---

This solution provides a practical, actionable plan to implement the four widget types in Pipulate, leveraging its existing architecture while addressing the article’s requirements. The focus on HTMX, FastHTML conventions, and local-first principles ensures the changes enhance the framework without compromising its integrity.

## Claude 3.7 Sonnet Analyzes Gemini and Grok's Responses

> Wow, did Grok miss the mark. Granted, the context was enormous. But I
> explicitly say that the prompt will be found at the bottom of the last article
> included. Gemini grokked that and Grok didn't. Handing it over to Claude for
> an analysis of the AI-generated implementation plans.

**Me**: Analyze the responses from Gemini and Grok on this topic. Tell me what Gemini saw that Grok didn't and make qualitative assessments about their respective responses, especially from your perspective as the code assistant that will be helping with implementation.

**Claude**: Both Gemini and Grok missed the mark on the primary request. You asked specifically for research on the best JavaScript library for code highlighting with copy functionality, focused on implementing a new Step 5 similar to the Mermaid diagram step.

Gemini's response was more on target:
- Correctly identified that you needed a code syntax highlighting library with copy functionality
- Researched and compared options (Prism.js, Highlight.js, CodeMirror)
- Recommended Prism.js with detailed implementation steps
- Provided a clear plan for adding Step 5 to the widget examples

Grok misunderstood completely:
- Provided a general implementation plan for the entire `60_widget_examples.py` file
- Focused on implementing Steps 1-4 which already exist
- Failed to address your request for a new Step 5
- Didn't research code highlighting libraries at all

For implementation, Gemini's recommendation of Prism.js is solid. It's lightweight, has good language support, and includes a copy-to-clipboard plugin. The implementation plan is thorough, covering server-side code, client-side JavaScript, and the required static files.

## So, What Now Claude?

> Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Cursor sees what I mean about Grok's reply and now also

**Me**: Indeed! So Claude, please continue this article as you see fit. My goal
is to get you into context, condition, shape and readiness (or whatever) to
actually do the implementation we're discussing. Talk to the nice people...

**Claude**: I've analyzed your needs, and based on Gemini's research (which was on-target), Prism.js is indeed the best choice for code syntax highlighting with copy functionality in your Pipulate workflow system.

Let's modify the existing download script to fetch Prism.js and its required components:

```python

    print("Starting JavaScript library download...")
    successful = download_all_libraries(LIBRARIES, TARGET_DIR)
    print(f"Download process finished. {len(successful)}/{len(LIBRARIES)} libraries downloaded successfully.")
```

Now, we need to update the `server.py` file to include these new libraries in the `hdrs` tuple. Let's modify line 2005:

```python
app, rt, (store, Store), (profiles, Profile), (pipeline, Pipeline) = fast_app(
    DB_FILENAME,
    exts='ws',
    live=True,
    default_hdrs=False,
    hdrs=(
        Meta(charset='utf-8'),
        Link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/pico.css'),
        Link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/prism-okaidia.min.css'),
        Link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/prism-line-numbers.min.css'),
        Script(src='/static/htmx.js'),
        Script(src='/static/fasthtml.js'),
        Script(src='/static/surreal.js'),
        Script(src='/static/script.js'),
        Script(src='/static/Sortable.js'),
        Script(src='/static/mermaid.min.js'),
        Script(src='/static/marked.min.js'),
        Script(src='/static/prism.min.js'),
        Script(src='/static/prism-copy-to-clipboard.min.js'),
        Script(src='/static/prism-line-numbers.min.js'),
        Script(src='/static/widget-scripts.js'),
        create_chat_scripts('.sortable'),
        Script(type='module')
    ),
    store={
        "key": str,
        "value": str,
        "pk": "key"
    },
    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged
```

Next, we need to update `static/widget-scripts.js` to add an event listener for Prism initialization:

```javascript
// Add this to your widget-scripts.js file

// Initialize Prism.js for dynamically added content
document.body.addEventListener('initializePrism', function(evt) {
    console.log('Prism initialization triggered');
    const targetId = evt.detail?.targetId;
    const targetElement = targetId ? document.getElementById(targetId) : document;
    
    if (targetElement && typeof Prism !== 'undefined') {
        // Use setTimeout to ensure DOM is fully updated
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('Highlighting code in:', targetId || 'document');
            Prism.highlightAllUnder(targetElement);
        }, 100);
    } else {
        console.error('Prism library not loaded or target element not found');
    }
});
```

Finally, let's implement Step 5 in the `plugins/60_widget_examples.py` file:

1. First, add the new step to the `__init__` method right before the finalize step
2. Implement the GET and POST handlers for the new step

The complete implementation for a syntax highlighting step with copy functionality would follow the same pattern as the Mermaid step, but customize it for code highlighting with Prism.js.

This implementation covers all the high-priority items you identified:
- Selected Prism.js as the optimal JavaScript library for code highlighting
- Added copy button functionality through Prism's plugin
- Created a plan for adding a new Step 5 that mimics the Mermaid step but for JavaScript display

## AI Analysis

* **Title/Headline Ideas:**
    * Integrating Prism.js for Code Highlighting in Pipulate Workflows via Local Scripts & AI
    * Developer Log: From Pipulate Widget Bugs to AI-Assisted Prism.js Implementation
    * Pipulate Enhancement: Adding Local JS Dependencies and a Code Visualization Widget
    * AI Collaboration Deep Dive: Solving Pipulate Workflow Challenges with Gemini & Claude
    * Building a Code-Highlighting Widget in Pipulate with Prism.js and Custom Tooling

* **Strengths:**
    * **Transparency:** Shows the raw, unfiltered thought process of development, including self-correction, planning, and interaction with AI.
    * **Practical Examples:** Includes concrete code snippets (Python download script, `hdrs` configuration, JavaScript listener structure) and command-line interactions.
    * **AI Integration Showcase:** Provides a tangible example of how developers leverage large language models (Gemini, Grok, Claude) for research and implementation planning within a complex project.
    * **Problem-Solving Detail:** Documents the specific steps taken to address technical hurdles (like local JS management and library selection).

* **Weaknesses:**
    * **High Context Dependency:** Extremely difficult for readers unfamiliar with Pipulate, its architecture (FastHTML, workflows, plugins), and the author's specific setup to fully grasp without significant prior knowledge.
    * **Meandering Narrative:** The journal format naturally jumps between different sub-problems (widget cleanup, download script, library research) which can make the primary goal (code highlighting widget) less immediately obvious.
    * **Jargon and Implicit Knowledge:** Relies heavily on project-specific terms and assumes understanding of concepts like "WET workflows" or the "contrarian anti-pattern moat."
    * **Potential for Noise:** The inclusion of multiple AI responses, including one that missed the mark (Grok), adds length and detail that might distract from the core technical implementation path.

* **AI Opinion:**
    This article serves as a valuable, detailed developer log documenting a specific problem-solving process within the Pipulate project. Its strength lies in its transparency regarding the iterative nature of development, dependency management strategies (local JS files), and the practical application of AI assistants (Gemini, Claude) for research and planning. While its high specificity and reliance on prior context limit its utility as a general tutorial, it offers significant value to the author or others deeply involved in the project as a record of decisions and implementation steps. The comparison between different AI responses also provides an interesting meta-commentary on the current state of AI coding assistance.
