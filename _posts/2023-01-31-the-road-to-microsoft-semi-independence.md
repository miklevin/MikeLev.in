title: The Road to Microsoft Semi-Independence
headline: Promoting Free and Open Source SEO Software - My Journey to Microsoft Semi-Independence
description: I'm working on a project to promote Free and Open Source SEO Software and show people how to set up a server on their Windows 10 or 11 laptops. I'm encouraging people to use Linux as a standard feature on Windows 10 and 11 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux and to be aware of Microsoft's paid services. I'm suggesting using vim instead of VSCode, as it is an industry standard and not tied to a vendor.

I can get a lot done in a day if I start early. I have to pull myself together
and be at the top of my game more than ever. Oh that's exhausting! And so I
will focus on the 20% of the work that will make 80% of the difference. That's
going to be dominating the topic of Free and Open Source SEO Software. I'm
going to be asking people to take a mental leap to believe that a server, now
on their Windows 10 or 11 laptops, set-up just so, with certain Jupyter
Notebooks pre-installed as examples and ready to go as 24x7 automation, which
is not quite set up because you have to pull the trigger on that yourself, is
just a file-edit away. Or perhaps a NAS or RaspberryPi or cloud server
instance. All 3 options are pretty easy, and you should know all 3 (not just
cloud).

An intro to my current work? Okay... if I were not worrying about being brief
for some elevator pitch (the too long but did read version), it'd be this:

Cloud is easy, but clever vendors hell-bent on making you their customer will
try to code costly dependencies into your very abilities. They do this by
controlling the tools. VSCode is one such tool, but so is Linux as a whole,
which is now wholly accessible through Windows 10 and 11 via their Windows
Subsystem for Linux (or WSL) product, now shipped with all Windows, and under
the Microsoft Store infrastructure, so it can keep updating underneath of you.
But the 2 updates it recently shipped for all modern Windows users is Linux
graphics and the Linux service manager called systemd. Both of these are
incredibly significant. The iron is hot because Linux graphics and systemd on
Windows.

So latch onto it. Show the way. Make the one seminal example everyone points to
saying stuff changed right here. Craft that story. Not only was the world
falling in love with ChatGPT which was being rapidly and lovingly embraced by
Microsoft (yikes!), but also the Microsoft platform which now offered Linux as
a standard feature started to be used to teach people about the prospect of a
life of Microsoft independence. Well, it won't be full independence, at least
not for awhile because Microsoft bought Github and Microsoft addicted a
generation of developers to VSCode.

And so the Oceans are Azure for Micro$oft, very blue indeed. Don't scrap your
Github account yet. Quite the contrary, lean into where Microsoft gives us
powerful freebie's. Just be aware that when those freebies are FOSS in nature,
there's something about it corralling you into paid Microsoft services anyway.
Go in fully aware. VSCode isn't as free as you think. Microsoft owns your
habits, and you will never be able to use the git or ssh programs without them.
It's vscodependency. You heard it here first, folks. VSCode-dependency... or
just being vscodependent.

You don't need it. You can live without the Microsoft paid service stuff, and
you should just know how to do it and be comfortable in a non-Microsoft
environment if the situation ever arose. Microsoft's stuff is nice but not
necessary. You need an editor like vim that lets you just edit text in general,
as a generic ubiquitous capability, not tied to a vendor and even if possible
a particular piece of software available only from one source. Your
dependencies should be on industry specifications.

While vim is not part of the Unix standard, vi is, and that's close enough.
You've got an industry standard via the POSIX spec a text editor that's quite
capable, and whose modern versions like vim and NeoVim are quite nifty indeed.
I humbly suggest that it is better to get on vim than it is VSCode. VSCode will
entice and enchant, but why when the alternative is to be able to connect into
servers yourself and just know what you're doing in a command-line, especially
when it involves running vim (or in rare instances, vi) to edit a file in
location. VSCode achieves something similar through... oh, that's a story for
another blog post. But it's slimy.

Am I distracted? How much can I still get done today. Start on the Google
Photos thing. That's of broad potential interest.
