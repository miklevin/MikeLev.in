We're all different. Some people thrive on being in the moment and responding to
interruptions and multitasking. That's not me, no siree. I love accomplishing
more than it seems like I should be able to, and I find that doing so requires
an almost altered state that I can only equate to a musician getting lost in
their music or... uhh... yeah, no other metaphor really needed. Didn't the movie
Soul cover this pretty well? Yeah, I believe it did.

I need me my focus, and I'm one of those out-of-balance types bearing down on my
artform and craft until it yields fruit. Artists do that. It sometimes kills
them, and sometimes they're not even all that inspired as they do so, so it's a
real lose lose situation, haha! Me no want Dunning-Kruger effect, but me know in
some Bizarro world, maybe this one, that's exactly what's going on. My attempts
to hit above my weight league may be misguided, and I'm perhaps destined to
fail.

NOT! Wow, these AI coding assistants are great. I was on that Microsoft Github
Copilot bandwagon right out of the starting gate, and in NeoVim of all places,
because that's where I journal. That's what I'm doing right now, and that didn't
last long, no siree, I can tell you. It was like typing into maple syrup, such
is my typing into the longtail outlier fringe edges of that normal distribution
bell curve of... of... Perplexity? What are those words I'm looking for?

**Perplexity**: You're describing the concept of "flow state" or being "in the zone," which was indeed a central theme in Pixar's movie "Soul"[1][3]. This psychological state is characterized by complete absorption in a task, where time seems to slow down and self-consciousness fades away.

## Flow State and Creativity

The movie "Soul" portrays this state visually, showing Joe Gardner, the main character, entering a trance-like state while playing jazz piano[1]. During these moments, the physical world around him dissolves into abstract shapes and colors, representing his complete immersion in the music[5].

## The Balance Between Flow and Obsession

However, "Soul" also explores the potential dangers of becoming too obsessed with one's passion[1]. The character Moonwind warns that while the zone is enjoyable, it can lead to disconnection from life if it becomes an obsession[1]. This reflects your own awareness of the potential pitfalls of being an "out-of-balance" type focused intensely on your craft.

## Productivity and Focus

Your preference for deep focus and accomplishing more than expected aligns with the concept of flow. This state often leads to high productivity and creativity, which explains why you find it so valuable for your work[2].

## AI Coding Assistants

Your mention of GitHub Copilot reflects the growing trend of AI-assisted coding. These tools can indeed enhance productivity, but as you've experienced, they may not always seamlessly integrate into every workflow or environment.

## Statistical Distribution of Skills

The "normal distribution bell curve" you're referring to likely relates to the distribution of skills or abilities in a population. The "longtail outlier fringe edges" would represent exceptional cases at either end of the spectrum, where rare talents or extreme deficiencies might be found.

Oh today's work journal entry is going to be a dozy, but first I have to switch
    states and focus on some client work. Sayonara for now!
