title: A Driving Force of Integration
headline: "Navigating the Road to Independence: A Driving Adventure with Nat"
description: I had an amazing time practicing driving with Nat. We navigated winding roads and a one-lane bridge, and talked about how learning to drive can help build confidence and independence. We even came up with a special code-word to remind us of this special moment. Come read more about our journey and what we learned!

Nat and I had a wonderful driving exercise time. She drove to WaWa and back,
including parking and pulling out of the parking lot. She did her first 5-point
turn in a small dead-end street, and we took Clubhouse all the way to the end,
navigating winding mountain roads with people walking on them, and going over a
1-lane bridge waiting for cars to come through, and being waited for as we went
through. We are communicating better than ever. I'm working on my listening
skills and talked a bit about the internal "other you" who you are absolutely
talking to and with during such activities as journaling.

That part of the talk was in response to Nat's assertion that she doesn't trust
or believe herself when she does a good job. The self-reward feedback loop is
interrupted, and in particular, there is a kind of getting stuck in a panic
mode. Her in that state only hears or believes internal information and not the
overwhelming evidence from eyes, ears and other senses taking in information
from the objective outside world. As an example of good information from the
senses of that objective outside world, I suggested that still being alive is
an excellent one to pay attention to for someone who's learning to drive.

I can think of perhaps no better exercise than learning to drive to come to
grips with these things about one's self. It's stuff that simply ***has*** to
be overcome in order for driving to be safe. It's fascinating to see. Full
integration, and indeed even trust between one's different inner selves, is not
actually necessary to start committing the skills to muscle-memory and become a
good driver. You can actually develop the skills and muscle-memory and become a
good driver before you believe in yourself. Then the truth of driving well must
eventually provide the evidence. That's some pretty overwhelming evidence.

Also regarding the choice of muscle-memory skills to develop to force these
issues of self-discovery, driving is a good one. It is one of the most
important skills for independence and personal power in our society. Driving
buys you freedom and even financial wherewithal with access to more jobs. There
is little "avoidance" in pursuing the skill of driving, such as there is with
sinking the same commitment into luxury pastimes such as rich-people sports or
flying lessons, both of which are of no practical value, at least not on the
same order as driving a car.

The human animal is a fascinating thing. Executive function of the neocortex
can absolutely override the more base-animal (or "lower" animal) parts of
ourselves, but it's a learned and practiced skill. We are born much more like
deer with a propensity to get stuck in headlights. Rough and tumble play and
sports often forces its development in kids. In play-fighting you feel like
it's life-or-death when it's not. Your body learns that not everything
presented as life-or-death actually is, and we develop that uniquely human
skill of saying: "No, that threat's not real" and thereby not being like a deer
stuck in headlights. But it's possible to miss those lessons, or have the exact
opposite lessons drilled into you by childhood trauma.

We reached a point in the conversation where I thought it would have great
utility to recapture that moment. Progress up to that point. I figured
"code-word!" This looks like a good time for a nickname. We had to figure out a
way to know that some sort of interruption exercise was called for in that
deer-in-headlights moment. Something that could at least remind us of that
point in the conversation and that oh-so-salient point that there needs to
exist some sort of... interruption exercise! Code-word achieved.

Good job, My Love.
