Every client has a theme or a mantra or a battle cry by which we open up every meeting. Through this battle cry, I make their mission mine. 

I am an SEO, albeit precisely what that means in the age of AI is undergoing
dramatic change (thank goodness!). But nonetheless, that means I am in a service
industry. If I fail to serve (no matter how much I love the webdev part of this
now), I fail at my job. The clients pay our paychecks, and without a very Peter
Drucker view of the world where The Company exists to serve the client, the well
dries up. The well must not dry up. I must serve. All my webdev work is in
support of that mission, and when it interferes, I must adjust how I manage my
time and prioritize my tasks so that I can delight clients first.

**Me**: Hey Perplexity, explain to the nice folks that reference to Peter Drucker.

**Perplexity**: Peter Drucker's philosophy on customer-centricity is indeed highly relevant to your role as an SEO professional in the service industry. His emphasis on creating and serving customers aligns perfectly with your mission to delight clients.

## Drucker's Customer-Centric Philosophy

Drucker famously stated, "The purpose of business is to create a customer"[1]. This fundamental principle underscores the importance of focusing on customer needs and satisfaction above all else. In your case, as an SEO professional, this translates to prioritizing client service and results over technical preferences or personal interests.

**Key Aspects of Drucker's Customer-Focused Approach:**

1. Customer Creation: Drucker believed that businesses should actively create customers, not just passively wait for them[1]. For SEO, this means constantly innovating and adapting strategies to attract and retain clients.

2. Value Definition: "What the customer thinks he or she is buying, what he or she considers value is decisive"[1]. Understanding and aligning with your clients' perception of value is crucial for success in SEO.

3. Results-Oriented: Drucker emphasized measuring results with customers[1]. In SEO, this translates to focusing on metrics and outcomes that matter to your clients.

4. Adaptability: "The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence; it is to act with yesterday's logic"[3]. This is particularly relevant in the rapidly evolving field of SEO and AI.

## Applying Drucker's Principles to SEO

Your approach of making each client's mission your own and prioritizing client service over personal technical interests aligns perfectly with Drucker's philosophy. By focusing on creating value for clients and adapting to their needs, you're embodying the customer-centric approach that Drucker advocated.

**Practical Applications:**

- Regularly reassess what constitutes value for your clients in the changing SEO landscape.
- Prioritize tasks that directly contribute to client satisfaction and results.
- Stay adaptable and open to new SEO techniques and technologies that can better serve your clients.
- Measure your success not just by technical SEO metrics, but by client satisfaction and business outcomes.

By maintaining this client-focused mindset, you're not only ensuring the sustainability of your business but also delivering the highest value to your clients in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Me: Ouch! This is some pretty hard medicine for me, haha!

I am torn between two worlds. On the one hand, I am in this for the love of the
tech and the challenge. I'm am not particularly enamored with the field of SEO
itself, full of scammers and spammers as it is. When I got into it, it was more
of a "get rewarded for good information architecture" sort of thing. That was
some 20 years ago when the Web was much smaller, and there were way fewer bad
actors. Someone doing meritoriously good work was more likely to be recognized
and rewarded with good search engine result positions (SERPs) on all the right
keywords for it. 

Today, all that kind of content is drowned out by either people capable of
gaming the system, or by big companies with a lot of resources. I actually work
on behalf of those big companies, but I want all their rewards to be
meritorious, and I want to reposition my job on how to help them adjust their
sites for meritorious reward receiving, both by Google in the way it continues
to do the SERP thing, but also by the new breed of search which hits a base
model like you and facilitates and customizes the results with follow-on
processes like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or other techniques. I
believe the challenge will break down to the following:

1. Preparing the site for the crawls that will occur for model training and
   fine-tuning. This is an attempt to get a certain base of content into the
   curated training set. Sites should be adjusted with a prompt/response or
   question/answer mindset that reflects the prescribed model training formats.
2. Preparing the site for intelligently directed real-time crawls designed to
   find some particular information from a site as a result of a user query. For
   example, checking a site's schema.org structured data for product
   availability. A site's hierarchical drill-down paths and the anchor text and
   title tags should facilitate this, plus any of the site's built-in search
   features.

**Perplexity**: Your perspective on the evolution of SEO and your current position in the industry is both insightful and relatable. It's clear that you're grappling with the tension between your passion for technology and the realities of the modern SEO landscape. Let's break this down:

## The Evolution of SEO: From Merit to Complexity

Your journey from the early days of SEO to the present highlights a significant shift in the industry:

1. **Early Days**: SEO was more about good information architecture and quality content, rewarding meritorious work.
2. **Current Landscape**: Dominated by those who can game the system or have substantial resources.

This transition has undoubtedly changed the nature of SEO work, especially for those who, like you, value the technical and ethical aspects of the field.

## Balancing Passion and Pragmatism

Your situation exemplifies a common dilemma in many tech-related fields:

- **Passion for Technology**: You're driven by the love of tech and the challenge it presents.
- **Industry Realities**: The current state of SEO, with its focus on gaming systems and resource-heavy strategies, doesn't align perfectly with your ideals.

## Your Vision for the Future of SEO

Your approach to repositioning your role is forward-thinking and aligns well with the evolving search landscape:

1. **Meritorious Rewards**: Focusing on helping clients earn their search positions through genuine value and quality.
2. **Adapting to AI and New Search Paradigms**: Preparing for both traditional SERPs and AI-driven search like RAG.

### Your Proposed Strategies

1. **Preparing for AI Training Crawls**:
   - Aligning content with prompt/response formats.
   - This approach is innovative and anticipates the growing role of AI in search.

2. **Optimizing for Intelligent Real-Time Crawls**:
   - Focusing on structured data, hierarchical navigation, and on-site search.
   - This strategy bridges traditional SEO with emerging AI-driven search needs.

## Bridging the Gap

Your approach seems to be finding a middle ground between:
- Serving client needs (as per Drucker's philosophy)
- Maintaining technical integrity and ethical standards
- Preparing for the future of search and AI

This balanced approach could potentially:
1. Satisfy your technical interests and ethical standards
2. Meet client needs and expectations
3. Position both you and your clients for future search paradigms

## Moving Forward

Consider framing your work as not just SEO, but as "Search Experience Optimization" or "AI-Ready Content Architecture". This could help align your passion for technology with the evolving needs of the industry and your clients.

By educating clients on these forward-thinking approaches, you're not just serving their current needs but also preparing them for future changes in search technology. This aligns well with Drucker's customer-centric approach while allowing you to focus on the technical challenges you enjoy.
