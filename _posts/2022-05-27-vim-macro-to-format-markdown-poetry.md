title: vim Macro to Format Markdown Poetry
headline: "Discover Independence from Microsoft with Vim: Unlock the Power of Jupyter and Writing Every Day"
description: I'm talking about how to use vim to break free from Microsoft, how they are trying to steal Jupyter's features, and why their attempt to create their own version of Unix, Xenix, flopped. I'm also discussing how writing in vim is like driving and how it can free up your executive function for more difficult tasks, and how writing every day can help you become more proficient with your tools.

This livecast, lunch with Mike Levin, is about recording a macro so that all
the markdown I do to format my poetry for publishing is much easier... it will
be recorded before your eyes, and thrown into my ~/.vimrc for future use...
which I expect you will also frequently see... because I write a lot of
poetry.

At the risk of demonitizing, LOL...

LOL, you got this shit, Mike. You're 51 years old, and that's ***plenty*** of
time. Just work better, smarter and faster than everyone else.

...so says the person whose negativity can't bring down either me nor my child
who is deeply struggling. I condition my mind. I help them condition their
mind. It is Jedi tricks. I have Star Wars to thank for some of it which I of
course quote all the time, but it does some deep channeling. Folks like George
Lucas, master storytellers, are channeling from somewhere. That somewhere is
not always unknown, in the case of Lucas it's the hero's journey and all that
myth research by [Joseph
Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell) and settings by [Frank
Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert).

Okay, so get your head on strait and use your next fifty years... not
***better*** than your last 50, and I have to get out of my head the temptation
to say that because my last fifty-years rocked the planet. It's just nobody
knows and that's okay. No, my next 50-years simply allows my algorithm to work
differently, switching from expressing mostly exploratory activity to
exploitative activity.

What? Exploit? Doesn't the English language suck? Yes, the English language
really sucks, the aristocracy keeping the common man like me down. Well,
eff-that. We common folk can rise-up... but not in rebellion but rather in
taking over the system. What's that? We already have? The nerds won, you say?
New royalty is the Bill Gates, Elon Musks, Jeff Bezoses and the unheard-of
Larry Ellisons? Well, maybe. But not all the nerds won equally.

It's the wolf-nerds who won. I don't wanna be a wolf. I want to be a sensitive
artistic soul doing my thing and not having to live that deeply entangled and
enslaved life of a tech-dude. No, nerds like Linus Torvalds and Guido van
Rossum really won in my estimation. They still stand some chance of not being
recognized and walking around to enjoy life. Yeah, maybe that's worth
coveting. And the real world-makers like Ada Lovelace who invented software or
Grace Hopper who invented high-level business programming (essentially). Yeah,
those folks are worth taking note of and emulating.

The wolf tech bros who eat their competition, they can go eff-themselves. You
know who should have been rewarded? Jay Miner who invented the Amiga. He should
have been Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jack Tramiel rolled all into one. But he
was a gentle sensitive soul doing his thing inventing hardware and changing the
world quietly and unrecognized in his day, R.I.P. Jay Glenn Miner and his dog
Mitchie, yeah, they should be celebrated today for inventing the love-worthy
parts of our world and not those the quartet of cartoonish cannibal tycoons of
today.

Elon? Maybe Elon Musk is a little bit different. If A is possible, so then
should B and C... only old-school establishments holding onto their seat of
power with fearful white chuckles and knuckles of a death-grip because shallow
oil tycoons are cheaters with nothing worthwhile inside...

    I am still the wolf
    Let's not make trouble
    Still the wolf
    Suppress your double
    Still the wolf
    Re-read your Carl
    Still the wolf
    And keep it moral

    Still the wolf
    You can do better
    Still the wolf
    A habit setter
    Still the wolf
    Commit in writing
    Still the wolf
    Consistent fighting

    Still the wolf
    Be who you wanna
    Still the wolf
    I know I'm gonna
    Still the wolf
    Rise above it
    Still the wolf
    A macro... love it!

    Still the wolf
    Let's now go write it
    Still the wolf
    Record & flight it
    Still the wolf
    That's more improving
    Still the wolf
    But now I'm grooving

    Still the wolf
    So write another
    Still the wolf
    Keep at it, brother.
    Still the wolf
    So let's embrace it
    Still the wolf
    You got to face it.

Yeah, I'm finding my thing. So repeat the poem. Make the above one indented for
"code" formatting via markdown. Make the one below where you're going to do the
livecast recording. There is nothing like this on YouTube. This is deep,
soulful artistic stuff of the modern age.

Nobody's going to recognize it. Sighhhh... is that condescending to you? Am I
insulting you?

# ZeroMQ, the Unsung Hero of Jupyter

What makes Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab so great? Isn't it JavaScript
underneath invalidating the whole "Python is so great" argument? If Python is
so great, why did they use JavaScript to make Jupyter? Well, the answer to that
is really that ZeroMQ is so great. JavaScript is just the necessary evil of the
user interface. All that snappy responsiveness of parts talking to each other
like they were one comes from ZeroMQ... ***not*** JavaScript.

# Do You Always Write That Much, Mike?

Yes, of course! Doesn't everybody? No? Well maybe you should. To me now writing
in vim is just thinking. Think in vim. Write in vim. No, let me correct that.
Think in your head and let your hands just carry out the motions in vim. It's
just like driving. Driving is easy. It's committed to muscle memory and becomes
automatic, as if the work of driving were offloaded to a coprocessor (in
computer terms). Same with vim. The work of typing is offloaded to that same
place in your body that tends to driving so that your executive function (your
conscious thinking mind) is freed up for the more difficult stuff.

If you're not writing every day and then you sit down to write (for yourself
like with journaling) or to code or program, think about how much of your
cognitive function gets dedicated to just operating the tool. That's stupid,
and even more so if that tool is a proprietary one provided by a vendor who
wants to make money off of you and could change everything on you any time they
want to for any reason (and has), and there's not a thing you can do about it.
You switch from one point-and-click style editor to another telling yourself
there's no difference and you haven't really been set back.

But there is a difference and you have been set back. Why do you think
Microsoft includes Linux now with Windows, hired the creator of Python, bought
Github (and NodeJS's NPM) and created VSCode? It's because they know everything
I'm saying is true, and the one piece they don't want you arriving to on your
own is vim.

vim is your path to independence from Microsoft... period. Linux may get you
part of the way, but so long as VSCode is your main (trained muscle memory)
editor, you will simply lack the ability to take that last step and be
incapable of understanding why.

I'm telling you here and now. Take note.

Ultimately, the text editor is your freedom of choice, freedom of mind, and
even ability to think in a higher-quality fashion that funnels your
unarticulated abstract thought through your vocal-center, thus articulating,
realizing, actualizing and even database-indexing your thoughts for accessing
later.

Be in vim every day.

I use it as my full-screen "Screen #1" in my ribbon of Virtual Desktops.

Microsoft also isn't crazy about you discovering the wonderful world of Jupyter
Desktop. They're lifting all its best features putting them in VSCode
(desperately) to take away that "ah-ha!" moment of discovery that you would
otherwise experience, revealing that there is better stuff out there than what
Microsoft and VSCode provide.

> We also can't let the flock flock to Jupyter so let's flock them. We'll flock
> them good and life Project Jupyter's best features and put them in VSCode.

...which makes y'all ***micro soft sheep***.

# Microsoft is no Linus Torvalds

Think this is the start of such Microsoft behavior? Wrong! In the early 1990s
when the writing was on the wall about Unix's eventual dominance, when AT&T
SVr4 was threatening to take the world, Microsoft made their own version of
Unix called Xenix. It flopped. Microsoft is no Linus Torvalds.
