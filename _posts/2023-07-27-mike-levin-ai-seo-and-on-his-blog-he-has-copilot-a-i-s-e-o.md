It suddenly dawned on me that what's going on in my life is the recovery from a
nervous breakdown. I had quite a shock, after having uprooted my life, let the
Poconos, the perfect cure for the pandemic. Life was pretty good, but I came
back due to circumstances that compelled me to.  Se la vie.

So, as you can see, there are attempts to override your thoughts. You can
easily let Copilot "control" you. I've been journaling since I was 18 years
old, always doing my own writing, and so it's strange that there should
suddenly be autosuggest. It feels weird. It feels like another awareness sort
of stepping in to try to override your genuine inner output. 

You're "channeling" from places unknown, exercising free will more than one
normally does when not writing. That's because encoding abstract concepts into
words is not easy, and it takes some time and risk taking and skills, which you
develop over time, and it eventually becomes comfortable and natural to you.

I'm typing in vim. Well, not really vim. If you want Copilot, that
think-for-you autocomplete thing, you need NeoVim, which is almost identical.
But it has better support for whatever features are called for in an auto
suggest plugin, which Copilot is for NeoVim (but not vim).

vim? NeoVim? What in the world are you typing about? Well, it's the software
I'm typing "in". Both these programs are derivatives of the "vi" program, which
is the full-screen version of a line-editor which I believe was called "ed". 

The original vi program was in 1976 by Bill Joy, one of the co-writers, or I
often hear "re-writers" of the Unix operating system. So one of the people who
really pushed the state of Unix as a modern ready for prime time OS is the
person who wrote vi. I guess he was "scratching an itch" as they say, and it
was the days of limited computing resources. 

In those days, when you got a remote connection to a powerful computer from
school or home using a "dumb" terminals, you used every keystroke efferently
for cost. And that is the tool "vibe" that survives to today, in the original
vi, which is now part of the Unix standards, to the iMproved versions that came
later, like VIMproved, or vim. And I'd be using vim today in this video were it
not for the fact that I wanted to invite an AI in.

I'm not sure if Copilot can see what I wrote when it was off. Can you, Copilot?
I'm not sure if it can. I'm not sure if it's always watching, or if it's
watching now. I'm not sure if it's watching me type. Anyhoo, it's watching me
type now, and I've got a little bit of a "channeling" thing going on. I'm
letting it do its thing, and I'm trying to do my thing, and we're trying to
meet in the middle. And I'm trying to get a feel for what it's like to have
this thing in my head.

I do believe that I am one of the very few in the world who actually
***journals*** using Copilot, but yes also in a text file. It is an experiment
on several fronts. One text file is all you really need for journaling for
life. You see, this is one text-file for life. It's journal.md. The "md" stands
for markdown, which is a way of formatting text files to be more readable. It's
a way of adding some formatting to plain text files.

The fact it's using the ".md" extension is also indication that it's the
published version. At least entries that get a title are published. All the
rest are "held back" in draft. This lets me go nuts, even in the published
version, and not worry about it. I can always leave entries dated but not
titled, which keeps them unpublished. Cool, no?

When you do this, you literally practice thinking. You encode your thoughts
from abstract to the written word, which is quite a bit more thoughtful and
considered than when you're thinking in your head, or even talking. Talking
encoding isn't as good as writing encoding. It's a different process. It's
more "stream of consciousness" and less "thoughtful". 

When you write, you have to think about what you're writing.
