Okay, so continuing with the draft of that book. Let's at least knock out the
draft ASAP with continuity and consistency here. Knock it out for practice on
what I hope to be one of the main preoccupations of the second half of my life,
for life begins at fifty. By that time you've had enough experiences in life to
have a thing or two to say, which might be of use to other people or at very
least to help train the machines on the collective wisdom of humanity. But let
me assure you, every word written here is of my own hand. This is increasingly
novel and rare AI-free creative expression.

Okay, so what's the big idea for the book? What is it I'm passionate about?
What still has to be said that hasn't been said a thousand times before. What
is it that needs to be said as we advance into this uncertain and rapidly
evolving future?

That's clear enough. It's the timeless tools of tech. It's mastering these
timeless tools of tech, staying relevant and valuable even as AI takes up more
and more of our slack. It's to be the source of original as-of-yet unlearned
creativity and not part of the slack. It's the ability to create patterns that
both resonate with truth and are new and surprising. It's a tall order, but it
begins with writing, and the timeless tools thereof, which can be pivoted into
coding and other forms of self-expression that result in satisfaction,
gratification, economic product, and the forever expansion of your choices and
options in life. And that's not just from a money-sense. It's from an internal
capabilities sense. A readiness for any situation because your skills are just
that broadly applicable.

I'll have to get to the actual book outline, but it's okay to do a few
free-form articles or essays first to really flesh out the broad topics. Then
I'll go over the essays and form the outline. In the end, it's about preserving
that love of craftsmanship as applied to technology skills you can carry with
you and improve upon for your entire life. Not losing your skills, no matter
the churn in industry and the world. And ensuring the nature of those skills
are always relevant, valuable, and satisfying and gratifying to practice.

Yup, it's a tall order. The only constant in life is change. But with assured
change being a given axiom of life, another fine axiom is to invest in things
that you both find joy in and can help you, regardless. It helps when those
things are internal skills because they can't be taken away from you. No matter
how turbulent or crazy life becomes, if you've made these decisions well, you
will always have the means to feel good about yourself and be of value in
society. You shouldn't have to worry about what others thing, but this is in
great part the payoff of having invested in yourself wisely.

Going out into the world, it was always between art and tech for me. I started
in art because observing the world and drawing it was the most natural thing in
the world to me. There was both the things I saw and then the characters and
stories I would imagine. I found it thrilling to combine my observational
skills with story-telling. Had I followed this passion directly, no doubt I
would have ended up a comic book artist. 

But over time, it was the tools of creation that started to capture my
attention, until this led me to computers, which led me to losing my skills
each time the platform and software changed. I got started before there was a
Macintosh, and I followed the roller-coaster ride of hope and heartbreak of a
kooky artistic computer that was the Amiga computer. The transition of my love
of art to the love of tools for the creation of art took a big turn towards
tech in my time on the Amiga computer. But it only served to illuminate the
fundamental issue that has grown to become my passion.

Using the tools of self-expression, artistry and craft whether they are
paintbrushes, musical instruments, woodworking tools or software on computers
requires developing muscle memory. I find that it takes some time and practice
using such tools, experimenting and practicing before becoming proficient
enough that you stop thinking about the tools and can focus directly on the
subject of what you're doing. The experience opens up new possibilities in
life, because you get a series of benefits:

- The satisfaction of getting into the zone or the flow state while creating
- The feeling of accomplishment and the end product when complete
- The appreciation by those who find value in the product or process
- The economic benefits of being able to trade that product or process
- The inexhaustible supply when this enters a virtuous feedback cycle

However, the volatile nature of the Amiga computer as a platform for art and
technology caught me by surprise, broke my heart, and made me have to reset my
beliefs. I went on a hunt for more timeless tools for expressing yourself
creatively on the devices of information technology (aka computers), which
brought me on a long, circuitous route through Adobe, Microsoft, and countless
other platforms and products whose names are obscure footnotes, Macromedia
Flash being a prime example.

As a sort of safe-haven, I shifted my focus from pure art to a more information
tech and data-driven focus, becoming first a Webmaster back in the rise of the
Web, and later a search engine optimizer (SEO), as that let me focus as the
industry shifted from generalists to specialists. And everywhere I turned, this
same problem pervaded. The very nature of the tools shifted and changed. When
it came time to document it all, even the choice of writing platforms was
plagued by this issue. Many paths led to the vi text-editor, or its more modern
and popular rendition, vim. And increasingly now, NeoVim. 

I resisted the vim path because of the strangeness of what it was proposing:
writing in a text editor that didn't even provide the mouse or touch-screen
user interface to figure things out. But it was a path that ultimate provided
what I was looking for: that timeless writing environment, providing focus and
immunity from technology and platform churn. And once you get used to that, it
doesn't have to be Windows or a Mac underneath. It can be almost anything, and
that anything can itself be timeless. And so begins discovering and mastering a
very short stack of broadly applicable tools of astounding longevity.
