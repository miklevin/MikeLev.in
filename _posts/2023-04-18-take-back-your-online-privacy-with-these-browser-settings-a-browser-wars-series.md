I'm tempted to make a YouTube video for this, maybe streaming while I work. But
that would only slow me down, and I can't be slow. Put a big burst of creative
energy into this *without* being hobbled by the need to make a video.

Okay, but do put as much pedantic detail into these step-by-step blog posts. I
love the way I can incorporate screenshots so easily. Okay, one distraction. I
need to change the default search behavior of Edge's address bar. It's easy to
use The New Bing ChatBot now in other ways, so I'm going to undo all the
default browser settings in Edge Microsoft worked so hard to get me to yield
to. If you wanted the new Bing, you basically had to cry Uncle! and let
Microsoft do whatever they wanted to your privacy settings. Let's undo that.

Me: Look at this YouTube video description and give me a list of comma-separated
keywords on one line that would enhance peoples' ability to find this video in
a YouTube search. Don't just extract keywords, but come up with variations and
common misspellings that will make the keyword list not redundant with the
description:

In the latest installment of the browser wars, we go into Edge settings and
undo a lot of the concede-to-Microsoft acrobatics we did to get The New Bing.
We shouted Uncle! And now Microsoft pwned our browser. These steps turn off a
few of the privacy violating features Microsoft enabled when you ran the .exe
to get short-listed for the new Bing. It also shows the latest place they're
trying to hide how you change your browser's default search. Frankly, it's
amazing mainstream browsers are still letting you copy/paste URLs, such is the
insidiousness of the vendor lock-in maneuvers of the browser wars.
