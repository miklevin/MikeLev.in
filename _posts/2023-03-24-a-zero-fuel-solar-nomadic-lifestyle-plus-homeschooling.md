**Mike Levin:** List a series of nomadic lifestyles where it would take little to no cost to live, given what is nust becoming possible with advancements in tech, if all your fuel could be solar.

**Bing:** There are many ways to live a nomadic lifestyle with solar energy. For example, nomadic families in Mongolia have been using solar-generated electricity for improved food refrigeration, cell phone usage, and televisions to watch the weather forecast, which is essential in the life of a shepherd¹.

If you're looking for a way to power your nomadic lifestyle, you might want to consider a solar generator. With a solar generator, you can charge all your devices on the go, whether you're camping in the wilderness or parked at a rest stop. Solar power is a clean and renewable energy source, so you can feel good about your impact on the environment while you explore the great outdoors. Instead of constantly buying gas for a generator or paying for hookups, a solar generator allows you to generate your own power for free².

**Bing:** There are many solar-powered vehicles available in the market that can be used for a single person with cats. For example, the Toyota Prius Prime comes with an optional solar panel roof made by solar manufacturer Panasonic in Japan. Toyota says the integrated solar cells can add up to 3.7 miles of driving range per day (while parked)⁶.

Another option is the Aptera, which is the first mass-produced solar-powered car. It can go 150 miles after just 15 minutes at an ordinary charging station and has a starting price of $25,900³⁴.

If you're looking for a single-seat electric vehicle, you might want to consider the SOLO from ElectraMeccanica. It is a single-passenger, all-electric commuter that reduces waste and minimizes its footprint. It is priced at $15,500⁵.

**Mike Levin:** Write a story about getting an Aptera and taking to the road wofh 2 cats at 55 years old and still having to work for a small living, but loving the work and being able to do it on the road fom anywhere, so it all works out. Ultimately the story is about selecting a location for a ti y smart home for a few years as a stable base of operations and a place to keep stuff.
