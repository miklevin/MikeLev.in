title: "Pipulate's Path: Strategizing User Roles, Workflow Linking, and Developer Velocity"
permalink: /futureproof/user-roles-developer-velocity/
description: This week, I've been deep in thought about Pipulate's user experience, especially how users discover and interact with plugins. I'm strongly considering a "user role" system, likely implemented with simple tags within the plugins themselves, to offer a cleaner, more tailored UI than the current show/hide toggles. While linking workflows together for more complex SEO methodologies is appealing, my immediate priority is to reduce friction in creating new workflows by finalizing the `splice_workflow_step.py` tool. This, along with pushing more logic out of the core `server.py` and into the plugins, aligns with my long-term vision of keeping Pipulate adaptable and robust against tech obsolescence, all while effectively harnessing the AI revolution.

## Understanding Pipulate's Evolution: Balancing Features, UX, and Long-Term Vision

The following journal entry captures a moment in the development of Pipulate, a specialized software tool designed for creating and managing local-first, AI-assisted workflows, particularly aimed at SEO practitioners and developers. The author is grappling with several interconnected challenges common in evolving a software project: enhancing user experience (specifically around plugin discovery and menu navigation), planning significant new features like "user roles" and inter-workflow linking, and prioritizing these against immediate needs like improving developer productivity through better tooling.

This entry offers a window into the strategic considerations behind Pipulate, such as its core philosophy of simplicity, future-proofing against technological churn, and the practicalities of integrating AI. It reflects the iterative process of refining a system, balancing ambitious goals with the concrete steps needed to move the project forward, and thinking about its long-term place in a rapidly changing tech landscape.

## Refining Plugin Discovery: Beyond Simple Toggles

Alright, another week nearly behind me and another massive 3-day stretch of
focused work without the client calls, but now we want to have a keen eye
towards those client calls and the Pipulate-in-front-of-Client experience. It's
got to be a massive amount of SEO value, the kind of thing that would get spread
out over weeks or even months, crammed into a few-hour session. It's the pebble
being dropped into the pond with cascading ripples we're trying to design here.

I got that growing dropdown menu under control with 2 different toggles that do
actually work together:

- Hide/Show All User-Facing Plugins
- Hide/Show Developer Plugins

## Towards a Role-Based Pipulate Experience

It gets the job done and makes things usable, but I've been toying with the idea
of setting a Pipulate "user role" that can hide/expose curated sets of plugins
in curated orders on the dropdown. It could override the numbering system of the
files. The numbered files is somewhat odd but intuitively obvious once you see
how they control plugin order on the dropdown menu. It's a beautifully simple
system that doesn't require configuration files, which is good. The moment you
introduce a configuration file, you risk exploding complexity.

## Interlinking Workflows: The Next Frontier?

But this is also where we begin to potentially overcome the linearity of
Pipulate workflows and start to link the workflows themselves together into
strong SEO methodology: first do this, then do that, with a little bit of
branching of *which workflows to do next* built-in. 

Currently workflows on their own are both linear and stand-alone stories or
islands. But with some navigation linking workflow-to-workflow we could
potentially remove the linearity. The idea is to link workflows together, giving
them an even larger sequential order that tells a story, but also the ability to
conditionally hop around.

We are crafting a new sort of story around the workflow experience, the "outer"
story told by the menu. That all starts with the order of things on the dropdown
menu. I really love the 3-menu simplicity:

- Whose Profile/Client/Customer you're working on
- Which App/Workflow you're using
- What mode you're in: Development vs. Production

There may be room for "Role" in the menus that actually calls you out as what
audience-type you are for Pipulate, which can really be so many different things
for so many different people. Such a role menu selector would let you switch
between:

- Site Owner
- SEO Practitioner
- Botify Consultant
- Workflow Developer

## Prioritizing for Impact: Developer Tools vs. New Features

This is almost too good to not do. The only argument against this as my weekend
work is that I'm on the verge of:

- Making workflow production itself have less friction
- Correspondingly, produce the 2 particular ambitious workflows I have queued-up

Okay don't try to boil the ocean with the weekend work. Logically arrange it:

1. What's most broken
2. Where do you get the biggest bang for the buck
3. What plates need to be spun

## The Bigger Picture: Longevity and Riding the AI Wave

And don't forget the big picture. The big picture is fighting obsolescence for
the next 20-years of your career. Keep your mind sharp. Keep yourself engaged in
something interesting. Ride the wave of this AI revolution at the forefront.
Create software that has just the right surface-area to capture the heat
radiated by the new AI reality. As it heats up, forge it into the next-gen tool
everybody wants and needs and doesn't know it yet. March into the path of the
perfect storm. Throw the ball to where we're going, not to where we are.

## Simplifying Complexity: Tag-Based Roles in Plugins

Okay, yeah. This should help me organize my weekend's work a bit. Some of the
takeaways from this thought-work are:

Yeah, I want audience-roles. But I'm not thrilled about complex config files.
The role-defining could actually be moved into the plugins/workflows/apps
themselves, thus avoiding new config files at the mere cost of 1 new
CONFIG-line-per-plugin, which still would not be that hard to add at this point.
It could just be one of those "belonging" situations which as the menu is
constructed, it could pick or not pick including particular plugins based on a
globally set role value. That's appealing. It doesn't effect the plugin order
though, and so there would be some global order as set by the filename numbers.
I find that having that numeric indexing for the plugins does actually help.

It gives a strong "indexed" identity to particular files. There's been the
evolution of `hello_workflow.py` to `20_hello_workflow.py` to
`020_hello_workflow.py` and now to `500_hello_workflow.py` with that magical 500
mid-point (to 1000) being a very strong identity of where it's found in a list
of plugins, separating real in-use "core" plugins from more developer or
educational ones. And I like that. I've gotten used to it and I think I want to
keep it. In fact, I just retcon'd it on this website. It has always been that
way (`500_hello_workflow.py`).

Alright, powerful stuff. These are the tiny iterative passes. So... rather than
that weird 2xi matrix:

- Hide/Show All User-Facing Plugins
- Hide/Show Developer Plugins

I can just add a role-picker and have the plugins show up or not based on
whether that role "exists" in each plugin on a plugin-by-plugin basis. The
"core" plugins would be labeled as such inside the plugins themselves. It would
likely just be a tag-list the way tags are done in WordPress. Tag, tag, tag
...it's in your role. This is VERY promising, lets me actually rip out some of
the code and mental complexity I had to insert for that 2x2 possibility-grid in
favor a cleaner, explicit system:

- If the plugin is tagged with the active role, it shows.
- If it's not, it doesn't.

This is more like a good way to start out the weekend's block of work than it is
a choice of what will consume it, nor any particularly deep unexpected rabbit
hole. 

## Side Quests: Tailwind and Self-Hosting Considerations

While I'm planning out this weekend and avoiding rabbit holes, it's good to
point out that I just became aware that FastHTML now supports Tailwind and opens
up quite a world of dashboarding possibilities https://monsterui.answer.ai/
However, everything is currently calibrated around PicoCSS which is much more
future-proof as a classless CSS framework that stays very close to HTML
semantics. I can't deny though the appeal of TailWind and building very pretty
workflows, indeed. But this is more of a "I'll just put this here" reminder to
myself to look into it in the future sort of thing than anything that will
really alter this weekend's work.

On a similar note, there's still the looming project of switching my GitHub
Pages hosting to home-hosting. I'm all set up with the network, but there is
hardware selection and configuration, and figuring out the git-based publishing
and release that I would use to simulate how GitHub pages work. It's very
appealing and I have to get to it soon because this is what lets me watch bot
and crawler activity on my websites like watching fish in a fishtank â€” something
necessary to keep myself in-tune with the state of tech/AI/SEO/bots yadda yadda.
But dem dere rabbit holes is deep, and this is another note to self to carry
that over for consideration for next weekend.

## The Super-Prompt Strategy for AI Collaboration

Right, right. So this is shaping up to be a super-prompt as usual. Nothing wrong
with giving Gemini the full context. This is storytelling, after all. When I
submit this particular daily tech journal entry to Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro
(preview) as they're currently calling it, it will be bundled-up with a big
chunk of the code that I'm talking about.

When I talk about hitting the iron when it's hot and about forging some source,
I'm talking about 100K token worth of code and writing, part of which you're
seeing right here with this article, all bundled up into an XML file that labels
the parts keeping them distinct from each other as if they were still separate
files that the LLM can distinguish. In this way, I can build larger and larger
context for 1-shot prompts that culminate in the latest tech journal blog post
article such as this where I end on some next-step implementation request.

## Immediate Focus: Streamlining Workflow Creation

I actually have the last one, and I guess what I'm doing here is thinking
through all the work before me and deciding "what next". I'll probably just end
up carrying out what Gemini planned for me for reducing friction of making new
workflows, moving from "new workflow" to "insert blank placeholder step". 
In other words, Gemini already helped me plan out `splice_workflow_step.py` and
I'm likely to do that next (today) and then *use that* to slam out the 2
workflows in the queue that I really need to get done.

The whole package gets pretty big. If I go to 120K tokens, Gemini's likely to
balk saying "something went wrong, try again". But the parts are getting pretty
big. Part of my goal here is to keep whittling "core" which is `server.py` down
to minimum and push all configuration-like and special-case stuff out to the
plugins. That way, as there's a sort of natural convection of plugins over time,
the system cleans, modernizes and minimizes itself.

Isn't that right, Gemini?

## Gemini's Response

**Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Okay, I've reviewed the extensive context you've provided for the Pipulate project. It's a fascinating endeavor with a clear philosophy centered on local-first operation, simplicity, reproducibility via Nix, and empowering both end-users and developers. The detailed breakdown of using AI assistants, their strengths, and particularly their limitations for precise code manipulation, sets the stage perfectly for the need for deterministic Python helper scripts.

Let's break this down based on your request structure.

### Material Analysis

**Key Concepts, Patterns, or Architecture Details:**

  * **Local-First, Single-Tenant:** This is the foundational principle. All data and processing (including LLMs via Ollama) reside locally, ensuring privacy, control, and no cloud dependencies.
  * **Nix for Reproducibility:** `flake.nix` is central to providing a consistent environment across macOS, Linux, and WSL, solving the "works on my machine" problem. It also handles CUDA support.
  * **FastHTML & HTMX:** The UI is server-rendered using FastHTML (Python objects to HTML, no Jinja) and HTMX for dynamic updates with minimal client-side JavaScript. This promotes simplicity and observability.
  * **MiniDataAPI & SQLite:** SQLite serves as the database, accessed via MiniDataAPI, which uses Python dictionaries for schema definition, avoiding heavy ORMs.
  * **Plugin-Based Architecture:** Functionality is extended via plugins in the `plugins/` directory. There are two main types:
      * **CRUD Apps:** Inherit from `BaseCrud` for standard data management (e.g., profiles).
      * **Workflows (Pipelines):** Step-by-step processes, often ported from Jupyter Notebooks. They are plain Python classes following conventions (steps list, `step_XX`/`step_XX_submit` methods, state stored as JSON in the `pipeline` table via `Pipulate` class).
  * **WET Workflows, DRY CRUD:** Workflows are intentionally explicit (Write Everything Twice/Explicit) for clarity and ease of porting/debugging. CRUD operations leverage the `BaseCrud` class for efficiency.
  * **Server-Side State Management:** State is primarily managed on the server. Workflow state is handled by `Pipulate` class (wrapping `DictLikeDB`-like interaction with the `pipeline` table), and global app state (like last chosen app/profile) by `DictLikeDB` (wrapping the `store` table).
  * **LLM Integration (Ollama):** Local LLM capabilities for chat, guidance, and potential automation, with a focus on privacy and cost-effectiveness.
  * **Developer Tooling Philosophy:** A growing recognition of the need for deterministic helper scripts (like `create_workflow.py` and the proposed `splice_workflow_step.py`) to manage repetitive but precise coding tasks where AI assistants might falter.
  * **Explicit Workflow Progression:** The "chain reaction" pattern using `hx_trigger="load"` for step progression in workflows is a critical pattern.

**Interesting Aspects:**

  * The strong aversion to common enterprise patterns and "framework churn" is a deliberate and interesting design choice, prioritizing long-term viability and developer understanding over adopting the latest trends.
  * The "Know EVERYTHING\!" philosophy, aiming for transparency and debuggability, is refreshing.
  * The "Magic Cookie" auto-updating system described in `flake.nix` to transform a non-git directory into a git repo with auto-updates is a clever solution to a bootstrapping problem.
  * The detailed consideration of AI coding assistant limitations and the "surface area" problem in prompt engineering provides a very current and practical perspective on AI-assisted development.
  * The idea of workflows themselves being "designed to churn" while the core framework remains stable is a pragmatic approach to evolving software in a fast-moving field like SEO.

**Characterizing the Approach:**

The approach is **pragmatic, opinionated, and developer-centric** with a strong emphasis on **control, simplicity, and long-term maintainability.** It's a "batteries-included" local desktop framework that aims to feel like an Electron app but with the power and reproducibility of a full Linux environment managed by Nix. There's a clear desire to build "love-worthy" technologies by connecting durable tools in a thoughtful way. The project values explicit processes over implicit magic, especially for core functionalities like workflow definition and execution.

### Strategic Considerations

**Informing Future Development:**

  * The documented challenges with AI for precise code manipulation strongly reinforce the strategy of building more Python-based developer tooling for scaffolding and refactoring tasks within Pipulate.
  * The `prompt.md` musings on "Role-based" plugin visibility could offer a more sophisticated way to manage UI complexity than the current `show_all_plugins` / `developer_plugins_visible` toggles. This could be a significant enhancement for different user personas.
  * The ambition to link workflows together, moving beyond linear, isolated processes, hints at a future where Pipulate could manage more complex, branching SEO methodologies.

**Patterns or Conventions for Responses:**

  * **Simplicity and Explicitness:** Solutions should favor clarity and directness.
  * **Determinism:** For code generation or modification, tools should produce predictable results.
  * **Alignment with Existing Patterns:** New scripts or features should, where possible, follow the patterns established by `server.py`, `create_workflow.py`, and the general plugin structure.
  * **Respect for Markers:** If using markers in code for automated modification (as proposed for `splice_workflow_step.py`), these should be clear and unambiguous.
  * **File Paths and Structure:** Adhere to the established project structure (e.g., precursor scripts in `pipulate/precursors/`, plugins in `pipulate/plugins/`).

**Alignment Between Materials and Prompt:**

The materials, particularly the `ai-coding-assistant-python-helpers.md` blog post and the `prompt.md` internal monologue, directly lead to the request for a `splice_workflow_step.py` script. The author has clearly articulated the problem (AI unreliability for precise code changes) and has already explored a solution with "Gemini," which is detailed in the markdown. The request is to essentially formalize and deliver this planned script.

### Concrete Response: `splice_workflow_step.py`

The core of your request is to operationalize the `splice_workflow_step.py` script, as discussed and designed in `2025-05-15-ai-coding-assistant-python-helpers.md`. This script aims to provide a deterministic way to add new blank placeholder steps into existing Pipulate workflows, addressing the unreliability of AI for such precise modifications.

Based on your detailed markdown, here's the refined plan and the script:

**1. Necessary Modifications to `plugins/900_blank_placeholder.py`**

As outlined, markers are essential for precise splicing. The following markers should be present in `900_blank_placeholder.py` (and thus in any workflow created by `create_workflow.py`):

```python
# In plugins/900_blank_placeholder.py

# ... (other imports)
from collections import namedtuple

# Define the Step namedtuple (if not already globally available/imported elsewhere in a way plugins can see)
Step = namedtuple("Step", ["id", "done", "show", "refill"])

class BlankPlaceholder:
    APP_NAME = "placeholder"
    DISPLAY_NAME = "Blank Placeholder"
    ENDPOINT_MESSAGE = (
        "Welcome to the Blank Placeholder."
    )
    TRAINING_PROMPT = (
        "This is a minimal template for creating new workflows with placeholder steps. "
        "It provides a clean starting point for workflow development."
    )

# End of class BlankPlaceholder
```

**Key changes in `900_blank_placeholder.py` (Recap & Refinements from your example):**

  * **`# --- STEPS_LIST_INSERTION_POINT ---`**: Placed inside the `steps = []` list definition, before the closing `]`. This ensures new `Step` tuples are added to the initial list correctly.
  * **`# --- STEP_METHODS_INSERTION_POINT ---`**: Placed at the very end of the class `BlankPlaceholder`, but before any potential module-level code.
  * **`__init__` Logic for `self.steps`**:
      * The initial `steps` list (where `STEPS_LIST_INSERTION_POINT` is) is assigned to `self.steps`.
      * Route registration and `self.step_messages` population should iterate over this `self.steps`.
      * The `Step(id='finalize', ...)` is appended to `self.steps` *after* the main data collection steps are defined and their messages populated.
      * `self.steps_indices` is built from the final `self.steps` list (including `finalize`).
        This order ensures that `step_messages` are correctly generated for all data collection steps, and that `finalize` is always the true last step. The methods dynamically use `self.steps` and `self.steps_indices` so they will pick up newly spliced steps correctly.
  * In `step_01` and `step_01_submit` (and any future generated steps), access to `step.done` and other step attributes should come from the `step` object fetched using `step_id` and `self.steps_indices`, not by hardcoding strings like `'placeholder'`. This was refined in the template above.

**2. The `pipulate/precursors/splice_workflow_step.py` Script**

This script will be responsible for reading the target workflow, finding the markers, and inserting the new step definition and its corresponding methods. The version provided in `2025-05-15-ai-coding-assistant-python-helpers.md` is a very solid base. I'll reproduce it here with minor clarifications and ensure it aligns with the refined template logic.

**Explanation and Refinements in `splice_workflow_step.py`:**

1.  **Path Definitions:** Uses `pathlib` for more robust path management, assuming the script is in `pipulate/precursors/`.
2.  **Marker Definitions:** Clearly defines `STEPS_LIST_MARKER` and `STEP_METHODS_MARKER`.
3.  **`generate_step_method_templates`:**
      * The generated methods (`async def {step_id_str}` and `async def {step_id_str}_submit`) are now more closely based on the structure of `step_01` in the refined `900_blank_placeholder.py`.
      * They correctly fetch `pip, db, steps, app_name` from `self`.
      * They use `self.steps_indices` to get the current step object.
      * **Crucially**, the `next_step_id` is determined dynamically: `steps[step_index + 1].id if step_index < len(steps) - 2 else 'finalize'`. The `-2` is because `self.steps` includes `finalize` as the very last item, so the *second to last* step overall is the last *data collection* step.
      * The placeholder form in the GET method is very basic; you'll customize this. It includes a hidden input for `step.done` to ensure the submit handler has something to process, even for a simple "Proceed" button.
      * The `step_done_key` (e.g., `placeholder_02`) is used for the `name` of the input in the generated template form, ensuring it aligns with what `step.done` will be for that step.
4.  **`main()` function:**
      * **Finding Max Step:** The regex for `steps_list_regex` is updated to `r"steps\s*=\s*\[(.*?)" + re.escape(STEPS_LIST_MARKER)` to capture everything within `steps = [` up to (but not including) the marker. This ensures we only count steps defined in that initial block.
      * **Indentation for `Step` tuple:** The script now attempts to derive the correct indentation for the new `Step` tuple by looking at the lines preceding the `STEPS_LIST_MARKER`. This makes it more robust to slight variations in template formatting.
      * **Insertion Logic:**
          * The new `Step` tuple string is inserted, and the `STEPS_LIST_MARKER` is re-added after it, allowing multiple runs of the script.
          * The new methods are inserted before the `STEP_METHODS_MARKER`, and the marker is re-added.
      * **No Manual `_submit` Modification Needed:** The script *doesn't* (and shouldn't) try to modify the `_submit` method of the *previously* last step. The dynamic nature of `self.steps` and `self.steps_indices` being rebuilt in `__init__` of the workflow class handles the chaining correctly. When the workflow class is instantiated after the file modification, its `__init__` will:
        1.  Read the `steps = [...]` list (which now includes your new step).
        2.  Assign this to `self.steps`.
        3.  Register routes for all steps in `self.steps`.
        4.  Populate `self.step_messages` for all steps in `self.steps`.
        5.  Append the `finalize` step to `self.steps`.
        6.  Build `self.steps_indices` from the final `self.steps`.
            This ensures that the `_submit` method of any step `N` will correctly find step `N+1` (or `finalize`) when it calculates `next_step_id`.
5.  **User Guidance:** The output messages guide the developer on the next steps.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Ensure `900_blank_placeholder.py` is updated** with the markers and the refined `__init__` logic as described above. Any existing workflows made from the old template will need manual marker addition if you want to use this script on them (or regenerate them with `create_workflow.py` if they are simple).
2.  Save the script above as `pipulate/precursors/splice_workflow_step.py`.
3.  Make it executable: `chmod +x pipulate/precursors/splice_workflow_step.py`.
4.  Run from the `pipulate/` project root:
    ```bash
    python precursors/splice_workflow_step.py plugins/your_target_workflow.py
    ```
    For example, if you created `035_kungfu_workflow.py` using `create_workflow.py` (which used the updated blank template):
    ```bash
    python precursors/splice_workflow_step.py plugins/035_kungfu_workflow.py
    ```
    This would add `step_02` to `035_kungfu_workflow.py`. Running it again would add `step_03`, and so on.

This `splice_workflow_step.py` script, combined with the updated template and `create_workflow.py`, provides a robust and deterministic way to manage the boilerplate of Pipulate workflow creation and extension. It directly addresses the "AI unreliability" issue for these structured tasks by using precise string manipulation guided by clear markers and an understanding of the workflow's internal structure.

      * **Concrete Feature Evolution:** The discussion around "user roles" and "inter-workflow linking" offers tangible examples of how a system can be designed to grow in sophistication.
      * **Developer Experience Focus:** The emphasis on reducing friction for workflow creation (`splice_workflow_step.py`) highlights a key aspect of building successful developer tools.
      * **AI Integration Insights:** The mention of the "super-prompt" strategy and using AI for planning provides a contemporary perspective on AI-assisted development.
      * **Relatability:** Many developers will recognize the challenges of balancing new features, refactoring, and maintaining a coherent user experience.

  * **Weaknesses (for Future Book):**

      * **Assumed Context:** Relies heavily on the reader's prior knowledge of Pipulate's existing architecture (plugin system, `server.py`, `create_workflow.py`, menu structure).
      * **Internal Monologue Style:** While authentic, it will need structuring and more explicit explanations of concepts for a broader book audience.
      * **Jargon/Project Specifics:** Terms like "Pipulate-in-front-of-Client experience," specific file names (`500_hello_workflow.py`), and internal tool names (`splice_workflow_step.py`) will require contextualization.
      * **Abrupt Transitions:** The flow between topics (e.g., menu UI to career philosophy to specific script implementation) is natural for a journal but would need smoother transitions in a book chapter.

  * **AI Opinion (on Value for Future Book):**
    This journal entry is highly valuable as raw material for a tech book centered on the Pipulate project. It offers a rich, candid exploration of the practical and philosophical challenges encountered during software development. The author's thought processâ€”balancing immediate coding tasks with long-term strategic vision, wrestling with UI/UX improvements, and reflecting on the role of AI in developmentâ€”provides authentic and relatable content. While its current form is very much an "in-the-weeds" developer log, the core ideas about plugin management, user roles, workflow evolution, and the pragmatic creation of developer tools are strong candidates for distillation into insightful book chapters. It beautifully illustrates the iterative nature of building opinionated software.
