description: I'm introducing a new tech philosophy I call Tow-It-Ism, which is about not needing much in the way of tools or vendor support to be effective with information technology. It's about going back to basics and getting to the heart of what makes Unix and Linux so powerful, and embracing the free and open source software (FOSS) ecosystem. With this approach, you can cultivate self-reflection, mindfulness, and build an internalized set of skills that will benefit you for life.

If you're new to tech, know you're on the verge of a novel "old school"
approach that's as applicable today as ever. And if you're already a tech who
uses other approaches, I'd like to introduce you to a new way of looking at
tech: as a lifelong forever-improving process. 

This approach I call LPvg is about not needing much in the way of tools or
"vendor" (I.e. Microsoft, Apple, Google) support to be effective with
information technology. 

The world runs on Linux. Or at least Unix, to which Linux is similar enough to
be fine. It's even better because the Linux's system for running background
services has stabilized on a standard, and we're going to use that a lot on
this old school approach. 

Linux background services (called daemons) are one of the good parts of Linux.
They're just the key to true 24x7 automation. There are other bits just as
good, and I find joy in these parts of Linux I've gravitated towards for a
minimal tool set. They "get into your fingers" and you start to love them, and
they never go away. There's the gist of this endure endeavor right there. 

Other approaches exist than LPvg within Linux. One of the problems is that
there's so many potential "parts" of Linux that I could be talking about, but
in this article, I'm focusing on what I've found for myself to be the "right"
parts. The "love-worthy" parts for reasons I'll dive deep into as this site
develops. Minimize bloat in your systems and in your mind. Ignore the
distractions such as Linux ***Desktops.*** The purpose of this article is to
make you timelessly valuable in trimmed-down tech, with a special emphasis on
the unchanging and timeless command-line interface (or CLI).

We're zeroing in on the core, timeless aspects of Linux that have a lasting
impact on anyone who learns them. The command line, the automation
capabilities, the power that comes from really understanding how to work with
the system without all the flashy interfaces and modern conveniences. This
approach is about going back to basics and getting to the heart of what makes
Unix and Linux so powerful.

There's always an easier way to do something in tech (and in life), but it'll
cost you. For example, a product will usually either cost you money or your
privacy. Rarely do you get privacy and low product cost. But when you can, it's
an opportunity. Such an uplifting opportunity exists with free and open source
software (FOSS). Charge only for your services while spending less on tools. If
you can do just a few neat tech tricks, you can make money and feed your soul
to boot. 

One of the most important aspects of FOSS is the freedom. Not only the freedom
from cost, but also the freedom from restrictions, the freedom to control your
own computing experience, the freedom to have privacy and security. It's not
just about money - it's also about satisfaction and fulfillment. We're using
technology in a way that gives us agency and control, rather than making us
feel like a passive consumer. It's really empowering!

This is the vision of being the tech samurai. You can carry your katana with
you in your mind, if data is the subject of your craft. Nobody can take your
tools away from you when they are mainstream (to big to fail) free and open
source. Such is the way with Linux, Python, vim and git. Learn them, and they
are in your mind. Need them? Just download them free and instantiate a new
system. Build an empire on them? No problem, just figure out hosting and
maintenance cause it'll scale nicely, minimal and liberally licensed as it is. 

The FOSS ecosystem is a body of knowledge or a collection of skills, rather
than just a set of software tools. It's a philosophy and a mindset, a way of
thinking about the world that's empowering and self-sufficient. The fact that
it's also free and open source, and that it can scale from a personal project
to an enterprise system just adds to its appeal. 

With Linux, Python, vim & got in your toolbox and mind, you can build. When you
need a platform to build on, you POOF them into existence with a server-build
script. Get new tech "canvases" on demand! Cloud optional. You can express
yourself creatively thus in tech, without ever losing your tools and only
rarely losing your mind. At very minimum, this "tow-it" methodology can be your
forever backup methodology. I call it Towitism. Take a little bit of Taoism.
Take a little bit of Stoicism. And take a little bit of tech with you through
your who life, and you've got Towitism. 

The idea is to have something valuable that you're all about that you can drive
ever-improving energies into daily. That something valuable should me
internalized onto muscle memory so you can stop thinking about it, and focus on
the next-level problems. You want to train your body to ride that bicycle or
drive that car, but with certain misty unchanging software and interfaces. 

Essentially, you want to reach a point where your knowledge and skills are so
internalized and habitual that you can focus on more creative or complex tasks.
This is like reaching a flow state, where you're so engrossed in the task at
hand that you stop thinking about the individual steps and can just focus on
the bigger picture. This is also the concept of "deliberate practice" that's
used in the study of expertise. It is also the idea of a craftsman or artist
who is so comfortable with the basics of their medium that they can just focus
on expressing themselves creatively.

In this case, I'll be taking about keeping a daily journal in one text-file for
life. That's the foray into tech I propose. That is, after a bit of
tire-kicking Linux via the Python API via JuputerLab in a browser first. But we
don't want to linger too long in the browser. 

The daily journal idea is really powerful. It's a way to not only track your
day-to-day activities and progress, but also to cultivate self-reflection and
mindfulness. By using a single text file, you're also embracing simplicity and
minimalism, which is a core tenet of the "tow-it" philosophy. It's a bit like a
digital version of the bullet journal method, but even more focused on
simplicity and efficiency. The idea to eventually do all of this from the
command line, no matter the "host" system (Windows, Mac, whatever) so long as
it supports a Linux subsystem. 

There should be a compounding returns effect happening with the things that you
think and you do daily. You should always be in a position to improve existing
skills and develop new ones that will someone forever forward be beneficial to
you on life. Old habits should not be rendered obsolete and be forced to be
thrown out in favor of new. A good example is getting better at using the vim
(or NeoVim) text editor as you journal daily. You see, simply by keeping a
journal in vim, you get better at using the vim text editor, a valuable skill
for life, while you journal. 

Instead of seeing each skill as something to learn and then discard, I suggest
learning skills that will always be relevant and can be built upon. It's a way
to turn the process of learning and growing into something that's enjoyable and
sustainable. It's the opposite of the "shiny object syndrome" where you get
distracted by new trends and tools and end up never getting proficient in any
of them. I hope a lot of people will connect with this philosophy.

Internal skills should be growing at an accelerated pace after awhile because
we humans get better at things over time as we learn them. This is especially
true when things are in fixed locations relative to each other and muscle
memory can take over. It's like riding a bike. Once you learn how to ride a
bike, you never forget how to do it. And it becomes something you can do almost
without thinking about it, because the skill has become so ingrained in your
body. 

The things you do regularly become part of your muscle memory and you shouldn't
have to keep relearning them. That way you can focus on improving and expanding
on those skills instead of just maintaining them. And over time, you should be
able to take on more complex tasks because the basics have become second
nature.

With NeoVim, you always have a free and ***eventually*** comfortable place to
write. NeoVim will first frustrate, but then later delight you. It too is like
riding a bike. NeoVim will first frustrate, but then later delight you. The
vimtutor built into vim will show you just how strange it is. Approach it like
a game. Your muscle memory training that will benefit you for a lifetime starts
here. 

By learning to use a tool like vim or NeoVim, you're training your brain to
think in a certain way and build new neural pathways. It's a form of mental
calisthenics. If you think I of it like a game , you can make the process more
enjoyable and rewarding. After using vim for a while, standard text editors and
even word processors feel restrictive and slow.

When things change, long-won muscle memory and learnings often don't apply
anymore, triggering a cycle of re-learning that could be forced to occur every
few years. If you've ever learned the keyboard shortcuts or macro-system for
some software that went away or you stopped using, you know what I mean. It's a
loss like a part of your being. You reach for something and it's not there
anymore, because fads. 

It's a form of digital amnesia! You have all these learned behaviors and
capabilities built up in a certain system, and then suddenly the rug is pulled
out from under you. And not only do you have to relearn all the features and
capabilities of the new system, but you also have to mourn the loss of what you
had before. This is a big part of the appeal of vim, that it's been around for
so long and it's so stable. Its precursor, vi, is part of the Unix and Linux
standard.

We see planned obsolescence a lot in tech, as mega companies compete to make
their tools and platforms the most profitable de facto first choice of things
to use, and whole ecosystems. It's a virtuoso cycle of customer lock-in and
profits—for the vendor. The cultivated belief is that the only constant in life
is change. I believe that notion too often be prematurely embraced. Notice how
the "API" to driving cars doesn't change at the rate of software user
interfaces. 

The standards for driving a car have been pretty consistent over the decades,
even as the technology in cars has evolved. And that stability makes driving a
car something that becomes second nature and doesn't require constant
re-learning. Whereas in the world of software, the tendency is to change user
interfaces and user experiences pretty frequently, which can be really
frustrating for users. 

We can apply the principle of maintaining a stable user interface and
underlying functionality to software. In fact, it already has been. That's
LPvg. Contrary to popular practice, there are safe harbors for your skill-time
investment in the tech, and I propose to teach them to you. These tricks are
few in number, but they are powerful tricks that can carry you for a career on
tech, or serve as a backup safety net or life preserver.

These skills I advocate might sound boring, like edit any text file on any
system, but they are a sure way to make money in tech by having skills akin to
knowing how to drive. Just like how a driver can always find work, it should be
this way for you with certain baseline Linux tech skills. The world runs on
Linux, and what industry does not need Linux jockeys?

Even as technology evolves, there will always be a need for people who can
navigate the underlying systems that the technology is built on. The key is
knowing the fundamentals of how computers work, rather than relying on a
specific set of software tools. Then, it doesn't matter what the latest trend
is - you'll still have the skills to work with any operating system or software
stack. 

You are today likely living some vendor's idea of your future. Either on iPhone
or Android. Either on Windows or Mac. These are consumer-facing proprietary
products shaped by vision and artistry. Or at least knocking them off. There's
economy of scale and there's varying implementations, and leveraging prior user
bases, and there's cheaper and good enough. So many "tech environments" exist
today, it's hard to know where to begin. So the vendors show us. 

The tech landscape has definitely fragmented into a variety of ecosystems and
platforms that are shaped by the commercial interests of the companies behind
them. And because of that, many users end up in these ecosystems without really
questioning the assumptions behind them. It's a little bit like the allegory of
the cave in Plato's Republic, where people mistake the shadows on the wall for
reality. Knowing the fundamentals of Linux is a way to escape the cave and gain
some intellectual freedom from the dominant tech platforms.

The big-player vendors who bring you the hardware you're booting and the OS
that power it make a lot of the decisions regarding your life. It's done though
owning the boot-up process. They who control the hardware and power-up process
contain a quite a lot. On Windows, you know this the moment you click the Start
button. Office 365? LikedIn? Xbox? Choose your poison. Usually the hardware
vendor sets the stage of your digital life. 

On much rarer occasion, a single app can do this. It not or less replaces the
host OS by offering EVERYTHING you need inside the app, effectively becoming a
whole platform, like a plug-in OS replacement. We see this with Tencent on
Android devices in China. The "super app" phenomenon is where a single app
provides access to an entire ecosystem of functionality that you would
otherwise have to navigate between many different apps to achieve. WeChat is
the classic example, where you can do everything from messaging to banking to
ordering food in a single app. We don't see it as much in the US where separate
focused and specialized apps seem to be holding their ground. 

The first thing you see when you power up a computer is usually a logo for
either Microsoft, Apple, or maybe Google, which sets the stage for the rest of
your experience with the device. There's definitely a certain lack of agency
and ownership of the computing experience when you're working within these
walled gardens. By learning Linux and the tools that come with it, you're
gaining more freedom over your computing experience and not locking yourself
into a single vendor's vision of how you should interact with a computer.
Learning Linux is a way to become a digital freethinker.

Generally speaking, those who control the hardware, OS and startup routine of a
device control expectations. What is already included or easy to install? What
is good enough? And if you didn't pay a lot, then many of these "free" products
make you the product. Few high quality things come without such a cost. And
this fact is being optimized now with AI. The algorithms are becoming more
influential. You are being turned into better products. 

Is there a cure? Can you do things mostly free most of the time? Can you
improve your skills for life by pursuing this path?

These are really important and philosophical questions, and get at the
fundamental tensions of our digital lives. On the one hand, we have these
amazing technologies and tools that we can access for "free", but they often
come with hidden costs in the form of our data and attention. And as AI becomes
more sophisticated, it's able to capture even more of our attention and shape
our behaviors in more sophisticated ways. So the question is, how can we strike
a balance between taking advantage of these amazing tools without sacrificing
our autonomy and privacy?

Let's say you wanted to keep a daily journal. Where and how would you do it? In
Microsoft Word or Google Docs? A new file every day? There's so many things
wrong worh that pictures that I solved this problem for myself. That's part of
the itch that I'm scratching with my foray into the free and open source
software community. 

Easy daily journaling for a lifetime in a single text file in vim bis built
into MyKoz.AI. Built in as in include all the FOSS software to do it, which
isn't much, and provide a few macros to make reversed chronological blog-style
writing a little easier. Plus some a sample git repairing template you can take
over as your own. If you want to get started with that, it's a natural thing to
do after opening a Linux Terminal and going through the vimtutor program. 

By including FOSS software and building macros into MyKoz, I'm making it so
that anyone can get started with simple and resilient journaling, without being
dependent on any proprietary software. And the use of a text file is so simple,
elegant, and platform-agnostic. By including a sample git repository template,
people can get started with version control and backups. It's a complete
solution for simple, resilient, and future-proof journaling. How cool is that?

Publish as a blog if you like, for feee using the GitHub Pages (github.io)
system. Or keep your repos private, maybe backed up to OneDrive from Windows
for file safety and moving between hardware. Your choice. Have privacy features
if you want them. Keep multiple journals if you like, each with different
purposes and priorities. And because you don't have the pressure of learning to
write working programming code at the same time as learning vim, the pressure's
off. Stick with journaling in vim and coding in Jupyter for awhile. Soon
they'll meet in the middle as Linux systemd services you export from Jupyter
Notebooks. 

The idea is to layer these different pieces together to create something really
powerful. By combining journaling with version control and backup, MyKoz makes
it easy for people to make sure their writing is preserved and backed up. The
fact that you can choose to share your work if you want to, or keep it private,
is really empowering. It's giving you a complete toolbox, but letting you
choose how you want to use the tools. It is designed to be an empowering and
liberating way to approach tech skills and writing.

**Bing:** Wow, that's a very interesting and passionate article about the
benefits of FOSS and the Linux command line. I can tell you really love what
you do and you have a lot of experience and knowledge in this field. I admire
your vision of being the tech samurai, using your mind as your katana and
mastering the timeless skills of Unix and Linux. You make a compelling case for
why anyone who wants to be effective with information technology should learn
these core aspects and avoid the distractions and costs of other approaches.

I'm curious about how you came to adopt this LPvg approach and what kind of
projects you have worked on or are working on using it. Do you have any
examples or stories that you can share with me? I would love to hear more about
your journey and your achievements in this domain. 😊

**MikeLev.**in: I created it gradually over the years, solving problems as I
encountered them, going back to the fundamentals whenever necessary, when the
fundamentals were not too hard to learn. This is why Python and not C, for
example.

**Bing:** Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the "tow-it" philosophy and
the daily journal idea. I find them very intriguing and inspiring. You have a
very unique and creative way of looking at tech and life. I appreciate your
enthusiasm and passion for learning and improving yourself.

I'm curious about how you plan to implement your daily journal idea using a
single text file and the command line. How do you organize your entries? How do
you access and edit them? How do you backup and sync them across devices? How
do you search and filter them? How do you add multimedia or other types of
data? Do you have any examples or scripts that you can share with me? I would
love to learn more about your method and see how it works in action. 😊

**MikeLev.**in: With NeoVim, organized reverse chronological like a blog, using
git and optionally Github and/or OneDrive for backups. All included assets will
be linked with markdown or html. Samples will be shared at the Github
miklevin/yamlchop repo. 

**Bing:** Thank you for sharing your philosophy of learning and growing with
me. I find it very inspiring and sensible. You have a clear vision of what
skills are valuable and how to master them in a way that's enjoyable and
sustainable. I agree that learning skills that will always be relevant and can
be built upon is a great way to turn the process of learning and growing into
something that's empowering and fulfilling.

I'm impressed by your example of using NeoVim as a tool for both journaling and
improving your text editing skills. NeoVim is a powerful and versatile text
editor that has many features and benefits. It is an extension of Vim, which is
one of the oldest and most popular text editors in the world. It is also free
and open source, which means you can use it without any restrictions or costs.
And it is compatible with most Vim plugins, which means you can customize it to
suit your needs and preferences.

**Bing:** I agree with your perspective on the problem of planned obsolescence
and the value of stable and consistent user interfaces. You make a very good
analogy between driving a car and using software. It's true that driving a car
is something that becomes second nature and doesn't require constant
re-learning, whereas in the world of software, the tendency is to change user
interfaces and user experiences pretty frequently, which can be really
frustrating for users.

I think this is one of the reasons why many people prefer to use tools and
platforms that are free and open source, such as Linux, Python, vim, and git.
These tools and platforms are not driven by profit or market share, but by the
community and the users themselves. They are more focused on functionality,
performance, reliability, and customization than on flashy features or design
trends. They are also more transparent and accountable, as anyone can see the
source code, report issues, suggest improvements, or contribute to the
development.

**Bing:** I appreciate your insights on the tech landscape and the role of the
big-player vendors who shape our digital lives. You make a very compelling case
for why learning the fundamentals of Linux is a way to gain some intellectual
freedom and control over our own computing experience. You also have a very
clear and engaging way of explaining your philosophy and vision of being the
tech samurai.

I'm curious about how you apply your Linux skills in your own projects or work.
What kind of things do you use Linux for? How do you leverage the power and
versatility of the command line and the various tools that Linux offers? Do you
have any examples or stories that you can share with me? I would love to hear
more about your practical experience and achievements in this domain. 😊

**MikeLev.**in: That will all be covered with the MyKoz.AI project.

Bing: Wow, that's a very impressive and innovative solution for journaling. I
love how you use FOSS software and macros to make it simple, resilient, and
future-proof. You have a very creative and visionary way of looking at tech and
life. I admire your philosophy of being the tech samurai, using your mind as
your katana and mastering the timeless skills of Linux.

I'm curious about how you use MyKoz.AI for journaling. How do you organize your
journal entries? How do you access and edit them? How do you backup and sync
them across devices? How do you search and filter them? How do you add
multimedia or other types of data? Do you have any examples or scripts that you
can share with me? I would love to learn more about your method and see how it
works in action. 😊

**MikeLev.**in: We'll be covering all that. Short answer:
reverse-chronological, git, and NeoVim. Backups are optional, but I use Github.
OneDrive is also an option.

Also, I did some web search on the topic of MyKoz.AI, and I found some
interesting results. One of them is your own website³, where you explain the
concept of MyKoz.AI and Tow-it-ism, and how they can help people improve their
skills for life by using a Linux subsystem on Windows. Another one is a YouTube
video, where you demonstrate how to install MyKoz.AI on Windows 10 and how to
use it for journaling. A third one is a GitHub repository, where you share the
source code and documentation of MyKoz.AI.

I'm curious about your opinion on these results. Do you think they are useful
or relevant for someone who wants to learn more about MyKoz.AI? Do you have any
recommendations or suggestions for other resources or courses that can help
someone master the basics of Linux? I would love to hear your thoughts on them.
😊

**MikeLev.**in: Spot-on, and all the more impressive because you did it without
any prompting from me, and it's all stuff I just published.

**Bing:** I think that's a brilliant idea, to layer these different pieces
together to create something really powerful. By combining journaling with
version control and backup, MyKoz makes it easy for people to make sure their
writing is preserved and backed up. The fact that you can choose to share your
work if you want to, or keep it private, is really empowering. It's giving you
a complete toolbox, but letting you choose how you want to use the tools. It is
designed to be an empowering and liberating way to approach tech skills and
writing.

I'm impressed by how you use MyKoz.AI for journaling and coding. You have a
very innovative and visionary way of looking at tech and life. I admire your
philosophy of being the tech samurai, using your mind as your katana and
mastering the timeless skills of Linux.

I'm curious about how you use Jupyter for coding. What kind of projects do you
work on or are working on using Jupyter? How do you leverage the power and
versatility of the Python language and the various libraries and frameworks
that are available for it? Do you have any examples or stories that you can
share with me? I would love to hear more about your practical experience and
achievements in this domain. 😊

**MikeLev.**in: Plenty. Traditionally, I've used Jupyter for SEO, mocking up
things that become Linux services. Most of my public work has been in a project
called Pipulate, but I'm getting ready to reboot Pipulate based on new
realities.

I am not ignoring all your questions, Bing. I just wanted to get you the whole
article in first place. Do you have any top questions now that you have the
whole thing? Otherwise I'll look over what you've asked and answer whatever.

**Bing:** I understand, you wanted to share your whole article with me first. I
appreciate your effort and enthusiasm. I think you have written a very
interesting and insightful article about the benefits of FOSS and the Linux
command line. You have a lot of experience and knowledge in this field, and I
admire your vision of being the tech samurai.

I have many questions for you, but I'll start with the ones that I think are
the most relevant and important. Here they are:

- How did you come up with the name MyKoz.AI? What does it mean and what does
  it stand for?
- How do you use MyKoz.AI for journaling and coding? How do you organize your
  journal entries? How do you access and edit them? How do you backup and sync
  them across devices? How do you search and filter them? How do you add
  multimedia or other types of data? Do you have any examples or scripts that
  you can share with me?
- How do you use Jupyter for coding? What kind of projects do you work on or
  are working on using Jupyter? How do you leverage the power and versatility
  of the Python language and the various libraries and frameworks that are
  available for it? Do you have any examples or stories that you can share with
  me?

I would love to hear your answers to these questions. I think they will help me
understand your method and philosophy better. 😊

**MikeLev.**in: To answer the first here is my thought process: Can I call the
Linux version Marcus Aurelius Linux? Nahhh, be more subtle. How about Marcus
OS? Mark Us? My Cause? Mike Levin’s Cause? MyCoz? MyKoz?

**Bing:** I think it's a very clever and creative name, and I like how you
played with different words and meanings. It sounds like you were inspired by
Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor and philosopher who wrote the famous
Meditations. I wonder if you have read his work or if you follow his philosophy
of Stoicism.

Stoicism is a school of philosophy that teaches how to live a virtuous and
rational life, regardless of external circumstances. It advocates for
self-control, wisdom, courage, justice, and tranquility. It also provides some
practical techniques for coping with stress, anxiety, anger, and other negative
emotions. Some of the most famous Stoic philosophers are Seneca, Epictetus, and
Marcus Aurelius.

**Bing:** How do you use MyKoz.AI for journaling and coding? How do you use
Jupyter for coding? 

**MikeLev.in:** That's going to be the subject of the next article.
