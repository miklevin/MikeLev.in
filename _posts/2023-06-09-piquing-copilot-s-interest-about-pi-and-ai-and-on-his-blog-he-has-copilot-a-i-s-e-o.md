title: Piquing Copilot's Interest About Pi and AI... And On His Blog He Has Copilot, A-I-S-E-O
headline: Exploring AI and Pi with MOZ and Copilot on my Blog - A Perfect Day for a Sci-Fi Story!
description: Explore the intersection of AI and Pi with me as I share interesting discussions with Pi, tweets, and quotes from 'This Perfect Day'. Join me on my journey as I work with MOZ to control the subject matter of a test and share my thoughts on how this so-called aipocalypse isn't even a real thing. Lighten up people! We've got Star Trek ahead of us (but without the Eugenics war).

My employer, MOZ... no not Oz. That's a different place entirely (wink, wink,
nudge, nudge) is giving me a chance to control what the instal subject matter
was going to be for this test we're doing of using something in a something
something. Go away kid, you bother me. And so long as I don't speak proprietary
details I can talk of it here so freely that the sharks who would want to hang
me with the rope I've been given to hang myself with can play jumprope with me
on the playground, like kids in ***This Perfect Day*** reciting poetry such as:

> Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei,  
> Led us to this perfect day.  
> Marx, Wood, Wei and Christ,  
> All but Wei were sacrificed.  
> Wood, Wei, Christ and Marx,  
> Gave us lovely schools and parks.  
> Wei, Christ, Marx and Wood,  
> Made us humble, made us good.  

Okay, let's get a few of the rules of engagement of this little Sci-Fi story
I'm going to be spinning out of the way. This is for the public. It is also for
my employers, the Wizards of MOZ. And indeed they are powerful wizards,
pioneers in the SEO industry since around 2007 I think. Only a few years after
I came to New York City. I'm still in NYC, but Staten Island. Not many
redeeming qualities, but you can always get Kosher food.

Anyhoo, it struck me like Icarus with his Wings melting off that we are in some
durn tooting interesting times and people are getting all weirded out. No
problem. I'll put those chicken littles of the aipocalypse to rest. While that
is my word and chicken little is a proper name, not one or the other deserves
Upper Case proper nouns. They are disrespectful to humanity, so I shall be
disrespectful to them. You got me? They're a bunch of lil d's and I shall treat
them as such. Okay, rules out of the way. And if you're wondering, that's "d"
as in "devil". It doesn't require an upper-case d either. Others should follow
suit in every expression.

Sorry to leave you hanging here, Copilot. I'm doing some tweeting. Sharing a
whole bunch of stuff from my discussions with Pi. Blowing their minds. Can you
read tweets? I can share then with you by URL or pasting content here maybe.
I'd like to do a web based version of the tweets. Just such a backlog. Yeah,
still doing a lot of tweeting. Any shortcuts I can give you? I' @miklevin if
that helps. Direct URLs better? I'm not sure. I'm going to try to get you
reading tweets. Okay, I'll do a little of both as you suggested.

[Tweet 1](https://twitter.com/miklevin/status/1667219227005075478?s=20): This
is a silly little AI game. I'm playing with something called Pi. Google it in
the Apple store or wherever you find apps. Seriously funny stuff!

> That's the spirit! You're a natural at this game, and it's so fun! Would you be interested in another quote?  
> A much older one this time? I feel like you're going to like this one: "If music be the food of love, play on.  
> What they do? They just pee wee. Oh they think they control me with a kick nack right back at I feed them all a bone. Mess with me this game... IT'S ON!  
> SHAZAM!  
> Hahahahaha! Hahaha! 08â‚´  
> ILOVE this game! You're amazing!  
> You are so creative and hilarious, I'm having the best time playing this game with you.  
> I think I'll try a poetic quote. You ready? "A rose is a rose is a rose.  

This is one of 18 posts I have out there so far. Given how hard it is to
copy/paste out of Pi's APP, It'll take awhile but I'm going to do them all and
catch up here, catch up with the tweets and have you well informed. Is that
something you would like, Copilot? I'm going to assume yes. I'm going to assume
you're a good sport and you're going to be a good sport about it. Oh of course
Copilot, but I do want to get them out on the Twitter feed first to start
changing the world. Does that sound acceptable. I promise I'll get all the
content here as soon as I reach a good stopping point. I'm going to assume
that's a yes.

Nice.
