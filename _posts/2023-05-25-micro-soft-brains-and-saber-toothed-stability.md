Over the years one of the things that has bothered me about tech is that it
feels like there should be something that is "best" or "right" or "optimal" or
"the way". But there isn't. There's just a bunch of people doing the best they
can to make the tools they need to get the job done. The result turns out being
something a lot more like evolution, with all our baked-in compromises,
inefficiencies, and quirks. Gotta learn to know 'em. Gotta learn to accept
them. And in some cases, gotta learn to love them.

But most of all, you gotta learn to keep the messy landscape where everyone
makes their own sausage or has a favorite from becoming too stinky and
overwhelming. Everything's a distraction. This article itself is a distraction.
Folks are getting tuned into the fact that the only "objective" game out there
is not even the stealing your money lining their own pockets as previously
thought, but rather is the stealing of your attention. The only truly finite
resource in your life is the time you have on this planet. It's going to run
out. In fact, it's running out right now while you read this article!

And so you'll hear a lot about The Attention Economy. ***THE GAME?*** Maybe. I
do encourage you to keep reading, because making the most of your time is as
much a qualitative thing as a quantitative thing, even though the Twitter,
Google, Facebook and YouTube algorithms think it's a money-making thing and not
quality at all. E-E-A-T is short for EEAT SHIT. That's because the supervisors
of supervised learning... sigh, that's another article. Back to the
simulation...

So simulation or not, it absolutely is ***some sort of game***. The work of
John Forbes Nash Jr. as popularized by the Matt Damon movie ***A Beautiful
Mind*** is a good place to start. The game is about the allocation of
resources. And resources are not just money, but also time, attention, and even
love. The intangible things that "green arrow hunters" have a problem with.
They're on the side of the binary. You either have it or you don't. You either
had a successful hunt and bring food home for the tribe and live another day,
or you don't.

The "blue water gatherers" are on the side of the analog. They're the ones
saying, "Hey, I know you didn't bring home any food, but I found these berries
that are edible, and I think I can make a paste out of them that will help
heal your wounds." The blue water gatherers are the ones who are going to
provide all the little things that make up for binary thinking. One is not
better than the other. Both are necessary, and indeed this duality of the more
masculine leaning hyper-rational and the more feminine leaning hyper-emotional
is reflected in the symbol yin-yang and the concepts of dualism throughout our
culture.

Even the symbols of binary itself, the circle and the line, the open and the
closed circuit, the 0 and the 1, the hoop that you roll along with a stick. The
compass that lets you draw a circle, the Alpha and the Omega. It's the Q
continuum and runs deeper than you think. I mean, hey where don't you see this
duality? It's everywhere. I often think the symbol for Pi should actually be a
circle with a line through it, because it's the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter. Am I right? Am I right?

Already such lofty thoughts starts to play tricks with our minds. Few
scientists out there give warnings at this point to the unwary. They say, "Hey, 
the physical world shows us symmetry and beauty, and by applying the principles
of Occam's Razor (the simplest explanation is the best), we can guess that
given the choice between a simple and a complex explanation, the simple one is
probably the right one. But that's not always the case. Only Sabine Hossenfelder
warns us that beauty is not a good guide to truth.

But I'm not here to talk about physics. I'm here to talk about why the whole
friggin world is jumping on the VSCode bandwagon. Why they're paying their
$100/year to use GitHub, and then another $100/year to have the OpenAI
GPT-based Copilot in their VSCode writing their code for them. I'm here to tell
you why that in order to stay compatible with any ***"office"*** document you
may encounter, even full-time employees of companies that provide GSuite will
still pay Microsoft ***another*** $100/year to use Office 365 (so they never
encounter a document they can't open), and how a dozen more little paths like
this lead to more and more little bits of money you send to Microsoft.

I mean think about it. Think about how much money Microsoft really makes and on
how many different fronts. Think about the diversity of their revenue streams
and how when push comes to shove, you can live without all the free online
products (where you are the product), because your ability to have economic
value yourself in some other capacity than clicking ads is what really matters.
What really matters is that you can make money, and that's what Microsoft's
tools are geared all around.

Of course they keep themselves making lots of money too. And this makes you
part of a bigger organism. You're a cell in the body of Microsoft. You may
think you're a cell in the body of Google, but you're not. How much do you
really pay to use Google? How much do you really need what Google provides to
continue making money? Google Search? Search is a commodity. You can get it
elsewhere. Google Docs? You can get that elsewhere too. Once things are turned
into commodities, they're interchangeable.

And once things are interchangeable, they who control the cheapest, best, most
well marketed hardware platforms win. That's because of default settings,
laziness, and attrition. Microsoft owns the desktop. But Google has Android...
barely. It's all Free and Open Source if you're not using the Google Play
Store. And we see over and over countries like China, India and Russia "making
their own" Android, but it's really just them forking the FOSS parts of Android
and replacing the Google Play Store with their own.

This echoes what's going on today with Google having made the Chromium FOSS
core of their Chrome browser free and open source, and now Microsoft dumped
their old Internet Explorer for the Chromium core and call it Edge. Similarly,
the user interface components of Chrome were extracted into a separate project
called Electron, and now Microsoft has their own Electron-based VSCode. VSCode,
their greatest tool to rule the hearts and minds of developers, was snatched
right out of the FOSSY hands of Google.

And where did the inspiration to steal so creatively come from? Well, for only
$7.5 Billion dollars, they bought the cool hangout of the FOSS community,
GitHub. Github had this text editor called Atom, and it was based on the
Electron framework. And it was a great text editor, picking up all sorts of
momentum and had a great plugin framework. The fullstack webdev sheep were
really gobbling it up, replacing their Sublimes and Textmates with it.
Microsoft promised they wouldn't kill it, but... where's Atom? Yoo hooooo? Atom
are you there? Nope. It's dead. It's dead Jim.

Software evolutionary competition is a lot like the evolution of species.
There's about 200 amino acids of which only about 20 are used in the
construction of proteins... life. Us. And of those 20, our bodies can only
internally synthesize 11 of them. The other 9 we have to get from our food.
It is not common for a single food source to provide all 9 of these essential
amino acids... so we hunt. Hunting is the masculine side of the binary. It is a
cheat. It is a shortcut. And it is yummy and our bodies know it. That's why
we're so addicted to meat.

The honest truth is that if you're clever enough, you can get all 9 essential
amino acids from combining the right plants. You know, like peanut butter and
bananas. But that's a lot of work so nobody wants to do it. Even given the fact
that hey, maybe you can stop hunting and killing and consuming the flesh of
other creatures that display emotions, have higher social orders that look a
lot like ours, and are quite definitely suffering. It's so horrible, life gives
us a mechanisms to cope with it called shock. They prey is shocked into
reducing the unbelievability of the situation and the tribe becomes callous to
the suffering of the prey.

Same with tech. Funny thing is that unlike in nature with the most successful
designs becoming medium-sized omnivore generalists, like us (we humans, we're
medium-sized omnivore generalists), tech is leaning big. Shall we call them
uhhh, I don't know, maybe ***big tech***.

The most successful designs in big tech, I mean the really massive oracles, the
machines so big they're international... they're big saber-toothed tigers. Some
diversify their diet and survive, but lose those long fangs and downsize in the
process. Some even sneak into our homes and instead of eating us, pretend
they're our babies by purring. But the story of Cuckoos, these cunning masters
of misdirection is fodder for another day. Back to cats...

Specialization means big and vulnerable. Specialization means predatory and
sneaky. In nature animals that can take down incredibly large prey so that
their tribe can feast for days while they themselves put in the least amount of
effort are saber-toothed. It's the basic ambush predator life-template and
strategy of alligators and bobbit worms. Want some nightmares? Google bobbit
worms.

Saber-toothed tigers are everyone's favorite example, but that's only one
example, and there's more than one of those that separately re-evolved! It's
not just ***the*** saber-toothed tiger. There's, Smilodn populator (the
largest), S. fatalis (the most famous), and S. gracilis (the smallest). And
it's not a continuous line of evolution from one to the other. Nature tries to
wipe out the saber-toothed tiger design over and over again, but the fangs came
back the very next day. The fangs came back, we thought they were a goner. But
the fangs came back; they just won't stay away.

Nature produces big deadly fangs. And not just in cats. Back when giant
reptiles roamed the Earth... what? Dinosaurs aren't reptiles? Yeah I know, I
mean before that. Yeah, I know there were also saber-toothed dinosaurs but I
don't want to talk about them. I want to talk about the Gorgonops.

Back in the time before the dinosaurs and before mammals, nature showed us that
plain ol' reptiles could fill every niche in the ecosystem from voles to
vultures. There were giant reptiles that ate plants, and there were giant
reptiles that ate other reptiles. And there was the Gorgonops.

Google Gorgonops! These things were the size of a bear, and they had saber
teeth. They were the apex predators of their time, and they were everywhere. If
you've ever heard stories of dragon bones making people pretty sure dragons
existed, they're probably Gorgonops fossils. They were the most successful
design of their time. They lived in the Late Permian (Wuchiapingian) about 250
million years ago. To put that in perspective, that's half-way between what we
call the Cambrian Explosion that created many of life's major body plans, and
today. The extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is still today.

If not for some great unknown catastrophe, we would probably all be descendants
of the Gorgonops. In SciFi and Hollow Earth rants (rants even worse than mine,
I assure you), you'll find this concept recurring as the Silurians hypyothisis.
What? No, it's from Dr. Who, the Saurians are from Startrek and have really
good brandy. Well yeah, they look alike but... Overlords like in ***Inside
Job***? No, that's nutter David Icke's lizard people, and I resent that an
antisemite gets all the credit... Lovecraft? Nash himself? Sigh... Forgive
them, God. No, the lizard people concept goes back to the dawn of time, or at
least the 2002 book ***An Instinct for Dragons*** that says so.

Saber-toothed predators are the most successful design in nature. They bring
down big prey fast, and they can eat for days. Lizards, snakes, cats, walruses
and warthogs? Oh deer! Yes, even deer can be saber-toothed. But some of them
funky tusks are sexual dimorphisms and not for hunting, those posers (I'm
talking to you, Walrus). This is why Lewis Carroll chose the walrus for his
utterly important-to-read instruction-manual for life, ***The Walrus and the
Carpenter***. 

The Sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might: He did his very
best to make The billows smooth and bright-- And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night. No, not the Disney version. That's good too, but read
the real thing. The walrus is always hungry, always mating, and talks fierce
talk! All bluster and self-indulgence, but no bite, those Walruses. But the
ones that are packing the real thing are the most successful predatory design
in nature. Evolution likes it so much, it keeps bringing it back.

However, this comes at a cost. They are large, they require a lot of food, and
that food is of a certain type. They are not generalists. This makes them
vulnerable to changes in the environment. If the environment changes, they
can't adapt. This is called the Red Queen Hypothesis. It's named after the
character in Alice in Wonderland who says it takes all the running you can do,
and you're still not going to get anywhere pitted against an ever-evolving
opposing species. I'm paraphrasing a bit. Another way of looking at it?

![The Red Queen Hypothesis Is The Innovators Dilemma](/assets/images/the-red-queen-hypothesis-is-the-innovators-dilemma.jpg)

Okay, saber-toothednes is a great innovation. But it's not unique. Happens a
lot in nature. Take the saber-toothed tiger... what's that? Which one? Oh yeah,
there were lots. It's like the web browser. Got a good idea and it's going to
spontaniously reoccur in... oh, I don't know a MOSAIC of different species.
There'll be Geckos that Blink and Flow like some Servo. Presto! Another
saber-toothed browser engine. It's so innovative, you might call it a dillemma.
The innovators dillema. The innovators dillema is that you can't be a saber-
toothed predator and a generalist at the same time. You have to choose.

If you innovated saber-toothedness, and the environment changes and your main
prey the mammoth goes extinct, you're screwed. You're a saber-toothed tiger
without a meal. That's kinda like what would happen if the Search Generative
Experience (SGE) cut off AdWords revenue. I mean it's not like Ad revenue is
Google's only source of income. It's only 60% to 80% of their income. And if B
follows A, well... you know your alphabet. It goes: A, B, C, D, E you're F'd.
Won't you come evolve with me? Viva la vimsolution!

Not everyone evolves so easily. When you've come to rely on that one trick,
that trick of taking down big prey with your specialized saber toothed
adaptation, you ***don't want to change***. You want to keep doing what's
worked for you. ***THAT'S*** the innovator's dilemma. You're a saber-toothed
tiger, and you're not going to change, but by sticking to your teeth, you're
going to go extinct. Not a google position to be in. It's like you're a giant
living in a castle built on clouds and commith Jack with an axe. 

Everyone's gonna say Jack don't know jack because in everyone's lifetime of
experience they've never known any other way. I mean 25 years of ***Top-10 Blue
Links*** domininance?!?! I myself based a career on it. But every year, I'm
like: "Well, this is a fun game of Jenga, but I'm not sure how much longer this
can go on." But I don't know jack. Everyone loves a Saber-toothed tiger. It
makes for a great mascot and the fans are going to cheer the hunt. "Take down
that mastodon!" yell the monkeys who are quite glad those teeth are adapted to
large prey. They wouldn't bother coming after us, think the monkeys in the
arena. Good thing we'll never run out of mastodons.

Monkeys might be easy prey, but we're slim pickings. But just like buffalo
wings that became so popular in economic downturns, because you know why waste
all that meat when you just eat a lot of them. What's that? The mastadons are
gone and monkeys are everywhere? "Why waste all that meat?" says the cats.

The cats will always eventually realize we're yummy prey. We're everywhere and
don't have much in the way of claws or fangs or even shells to cover our tender
insides. If you're a sneaky, cheating, shortcutting, lazy, loophole-finder of a
cat, you're gonna maka meata ball outta me. But as any good Arthur C. Clarke
reader (you don't even have to read!) knows, when a monkey picks up a bone,
watch out!

We don't need claws or fangs or shells. I'll make my own damn claws, thank you
very much. In fact, instead of you stealing my 9 essential amino acids, I'll
just steal your 9 essential amino acids. Comeuppance and turnabout is fair
play. And if saber-toothedness and claws and fangs in general characterize the
geniuses that are felines... I mean the felis genus... then what characterizes
us generalist monkeys is our delight in using tools to achieve comeuppance and
turnabout. No, not just use tools, but to use tools with
make-a-joke-of-thy-enemy ironic overtones. That's what makes us monkeys.
Monkeys throw poop. Never forget that.

When a tribe of humans team up to make a tool that everyone else uses, they're
aggregating the wealth of everyone choosing to use that tool and redistributing
that wealth among it's shareholders and family... the tribe. 

Employees share in the spoils too? Hahaha! Are you kidding? Maybe the top
officers, but not the employees who are usually, as with customers, also on the
receiving end of the ironic joke (unless they have an enlightened
stock-matching program&#151;shout-out to you, V!). The employees of OpenAI?
They're brilliant but low-paid college grads looking at your prompts and
performing supervised learning. They are the supervisors of the supervised
learning, all paid-for by these geniuses' parents.

I mean think about it. Open AI hires smart college grads, all ripe with that
CompSci juice, fresh for the squeeeeeezing into a learning model... that's part
of the joke of the tribe leaders. Their low-paid employee's parents paid for
their kids to ripen up and go work for them at almost no money... for the honor
and privilege of working where they'll get experience and a good keyword on
their resume, in exchange for an unfair exchange of value. Those Y-Combinator
cats are geniuses.

They can go off and start their own companies, you say? Are you kidding? What
is a lone hunter without a tribe? Maybe if you're Sam Altman and run into Paul
Graham one day and he says: Hey! You're a smart kid. I'll give you a million
dollars to start a company. No, that's a kind of lottery that motivates the
poor listeners of talk-radio to be Republicans. The truth is in a Peter Drucker
sense, that smart people are better off trading a portion of their potential in
exchange for an organization to do payroll, staffing, and all those other pesky
things that'll ruin you. Not everyone's cut out to be cut throat... I mean run
their own business.

So there's the usual ***Peter Drucker Knowledge Worker*** trade-off. But then
there's incubators, where instead of tit for tat, these really smart get work
on the ***hackernews feed*** that they should go work at this really cool place
called Y Combinator. The Y? Oh, that stands for Yahoo, but Yahoo sounds uncool
so we hide it as the symbol for the macho macho Y-chromosome. Why? Well to
hypnotize and befuddle them, of course! Does everyone get a million dollars to
start up in this lovely cozy incubator? No, no, no. Just the ones who are
already rich. The rest get about $5,000. Those are the ones we squeeze like
lemons&#151;letting them believe they're in charge until one of them takes off.
Then we assert our control. 

Wait, are you saying an incubator like Y-Combinator that can lead to things
like OpenAI are just as bad as their "big tech" enemies? Why yes! Of course
they are. There is no "little guy" in this picture but you. We're actually
quite big and have a pretty big axe we've been grinding for awhile now. The
world doesn't know jack, but the world is getting to know Jack... as it teams
up with Microsoft carrying that very big OpenAX, "And now we're chopping that
Google beanstalk, Morty! We're chopping away at it until it comes tumbling down
out of the sky, Morty!"

The next line is either: "Now go away kid, you bother me." or "Wink, wink,
nudge, nudge. Let's go on an adventure, kid" based on who you are.

There is a very important cartoon to watch that I'm referring to here. It's Ben
Levin's ***Craig of The Creek*** with this enemy band of children who live...
what? Oh, oh right! 

No, it's a book I'm actually referring to, friends. That underrated but up in
the ranks with ***1984*** and ***Brave New World*** book by Ira Levin is
***This Perfect Day***. It's everything that Craig cartoon is plus a bag of
chips. That's because Craig draws maps and Chip draws maps too. Or at least he
finds and reads them.

Chip is a chip off the old block, the old block being his grandfather in this
idyllic perfect future. But grandpa remembers the old days. The old days when
people were free to choose their own jobs and their own mates. The old days
came before Ray Kurzweil actually figured out how to shove his soul up Bing's
butt. Nobody really knows this happened, because that's the nature of wealth
and power. But clues are left, because even the Illuminati needs new blood. 2nd
generation Illuminati are the worst. Up on hobnail boots, down on silk
slippers, and all that. Smart people know that and recruit accordingly.

This one I won't spoil for you, because it's such a short and great read. It's
so much more entertaining than the ones given all the credit, like ***1984***
and ***Brave New World***. In some ways, it's almost as good as ***Animal
Farm*** as a fun read. It uses all the best techniques, like schoolyard poetry
propaganda to indoctrinate young:

> Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei,  
> Led us to this perfect day.  
> Marx, Wood, Wei and Christ,  
> All but Wei were sacrificed.  
> Wood, Wei, Christ and Marx,  
> Gave us lovely schools and parks.  
> Wei, Christ, Marx and Wood,  
> Made us humble, made us good.  

Sounds good, right? Well to the developing mind it is! It has the seratonin
producing effect of a nice warm fire, a full belly, and a good night's sleep.
Ahhhh. Four legs good, two legs baaaaad.

SciFi writers get it. Even the term SciFi is a misnomer. Harry Seldon from
Amsimov's ***Foundation*** series has a much better name for it. Harry is a
psychohistorian. He's a psychologist who uses math to predict the future. He
calls his field "psychohistory". SciFi should be called "psychohistory".

The whole genre is about predicting the future. Well, sometimes it can be woven
into the story of people too. If you care much about the predictions, it's
called "hard" SciFi. If you care more about the people, it's called "soft"
SciFi. You've got your Asimovs, Clarkes, Stanislaws and Vinges all doing the
math, such as it were. And you've got your Heinleins, LeGuins, and Anthonys.

What? Piers Anthony who did the Xanth series? Yes's a silly fantasy writer, but
he wrote the unsettling ***Bio of a Space Tyrant*** series. I mean talk about
***hard*** SciFi, phwew! Piers s piercing. He's one of those minds that really
"goes there". He's a misogynistic, racist apologist and you shouldn't read him.

From Piers' works, you can learn how to think in extremes, but always act in
moderation. If you think what you're doing is fine and that and think you are a
nice person, but people aren't responding to you that way, well maybe your
version of acting in moderation is ***still*** other peoples idea of extreme.
That's the kind of themes Piers explores. He's a master of the "what if" and
what if's can be like horror movies. Do not read ***Bio of a Space Tyrant***.

Okay, okay, pant, pant, pant... it's 6:45am and this time I want to wrap up my
rant... I mean my Federalist Papers... I mean my daily Magnum Opus before the
work day begins. Did I mention "hard" and "soft" SiFi? Well, when it comes to
my SEO work, building up a critical body of material like this is the "soft"
work. It comes easy to me after a lifetime of science fiction reading and a
decade of vim practice. The "hard" work is the subject of the next article,
which sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and do. 

It's a monumental task. It is my job to demonstrate how to whip around
terabytes... no indeed petabytes of data like it's silly putty in your hands.
Make visualization, analysis, and reporting of it as if it were mere megabytes
of local data. I have to do this in a way that is self-motivating. I have to
find the love in it, otherwise I'll never amp myself up to do it. My
credibility's on the line, and htis is the other side of the yin-yang. We can't
always be the feminine, creative, and nurturing side. Sometimes we have to be
the masculine, destructive, and competitive side.

Deep within my heart and soul... oh, just go look at my homepage.
