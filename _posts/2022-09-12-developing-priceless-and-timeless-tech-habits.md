title: Developing Priceless and Timeless Tech Habits
headline: "Mastering Tech: My Journey to Become an Active Participant"
description: As I learn to develop timeless habits for tech, I'm determined to become an active participant in the process. I'm sharing my own tips on how to get started and emphasizing the importance of simplicity. I'm proposing to show how to become comfortable with any hardware and virtual desktops, and encouraging the practice of entering flow state and writing. Join me on my journey to master tech and become an active participant.

I did a great video in the car yesterday about my theme and niche being the
gradual internalization of the tools of our age, the way our ancestors
internalized mitochondria and calcium. Today, we're internalizing the tools of
tech.

You can ether be an active participant in this process or a low-impact
bystander. Now there's nothing wrong with being a passive spectator, but for
the spiritual money I spent for my seat in this game, I'm gonna play.

Mine is not the story of playing strong hand from the start or even compensating
for disadvantage young. No, mine is the story of a slow start, false starts,
more false starts, then realizing late in life what a good starting point that
is.

It's easy to stall out, and there are unlimited excuses to stay stalled out.
Nobody's coming but you to get you stared again—so it's critical to internalize
your own effective starters; and I'm going to share with you mine.

Complexity of the kickstart process is your enemy. Demoralization as you turn
that ignition key because it doesn't turn on is by definition a nonstarter.
This will happen because the car itself changes.

Of all the things “done to you”, this is one of the easiest to do something
about. Start crushing those variables that change the kickstart process.
Develop habits that are timeless and priceless.

I propose to show how to be comfortable in a meaningful long-term muscle memory
way on any hardware that provides Virtual Desktops and Full Screen mode. This
is your vehicle, and I will show you the ignition.

Have a fullscreen text editor in command-line interface mode on virtual screen
one. In this window have a single text file that you keep for life. Update it
frequently. Back it up well. Organize it to help.

Practice achieving flow state and enter into the zone. Write and write some
more and write for hours. You will now believe what you think and know—and know
you need if you only let yourself process the thoughts.

As you settle in, know that while this feels like home, it's a home on wheels.
You can carry it to Mac, Windows, GNOME, KDE or any other desktop computing
environment in the future.

View the desktop environment of your OS as an empty shim with nothing but a Net
connection, virtual screens for fullscreen apps and a taskbar for switching
between them—little more.
