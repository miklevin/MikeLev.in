With software becoming obsolete quickly, I need to be informed about the concept of Virtual Machines, which is really about resource isolation. I'm also exploring the implications of this technology, which has been around for decades, in terms of performance and security. Read on to learn more.

pitch" such as it were.

- Are you ready for the future?
- The future is \*nix, like it or not.
- You'll hardly even see/know it occurs (like the Mac OS9 to OSX switch)
- Most desktop software has unreasonably fast (profit-driven) churn
- Tired of all your knowledge & know-how going obsolete every 2 to 5 years?

FORGET VMS

- All research leads to "VIRTUAL MACHINES" but don't get confused. Stupid term!
- It's really all about RESOURCE ISOLATION. Strong walls between things.
  - These tricks go back to 1967 (pre-Unix) and BCPL by Martin Richards in the UK
  - Unix was invented 1970, but around 1982 the "chroot" command formalized the
- The rest is details pertaining to performance, security and the like.
