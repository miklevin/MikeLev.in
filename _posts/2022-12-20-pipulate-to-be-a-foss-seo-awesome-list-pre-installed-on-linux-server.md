title: Pipulate to be a FOSS SEO Awesome List Pre-Installed on Linux Server
headline: "Making Day-to-Day Work Easier with Pipulate: A FOSS SEO Awesome List Pre-Installed on Linux Server"
description: I'm working on a project called Pipulate, and I've been editing everything all at once to make day-to-day work easier. I'm using Jekyll as the static website generator, but I'm considering switching to Hugo. I've also made my logo into an animated gif and used it in the headline of my main site, and I'm documenting the fact that Pipulate is a full Linux server. Come check out my project and see what I'm up to!

Chipping away at something little by little is sometimes the best way to make
progress, but this presupposes that you even know where and how to chip day by
day. As time passes it's easy to lose vision of what and how you're chipping
and why. The "sculpture" that's locked inside the stone per Michaelangelo's
famous saying goes blurry and out of focus.

I just brought back pipulate.com. It needs some primary navigation so I have
more than just one page to work with. I want the homepage of pipulate to be an
"awesome list" of Github repos I offer which together constitute Pipulate.
Currently, I slapped a ChatGPT description of FOSS and SEO on the homepage, and
that' can't (shouldn't) last. Clarify my vision for myself so I can help others
do the same. Prinav on Pipulate...

I'm currently working in Jekyll because that's the easiest thing to use on
Github, but it's not necessarily the fastest or best. Hyde seems somewhat
abandoned, the competitor to Jekyll written in Python. Another contender called
Hugo has entered the static sight generator arena. Hugo's written on Go and is
apparently the fastest. Maybe eventually I'll switch my SSG and I'm trying to
not over-commit to Jekyll.

I made my logo into an animated gif again. I want to get more leverage out of
it if it works in. Okay, it's worked into the headline of my main site. It also
uses a nonbreaking text headline with an inline graphic and the viewport
resizing. Okay, very nice.

Now start pushing forward hard. You might even want to get ChatGPT's opinion on
things.

Okay, document the fact that Pipulate is a full Linux server on Pipulate.com.
Done. Threw in the rabbit ascii art.

Things shouldn't be so difficult and your knowledge and know-how shouldn't go
obsolete so fast.

When you take the time to learn something, you should know that those learnings
will last long enough to make it worth the effort.

Okay, things went pretty well.

The premise of editing everything all at once is working out well. I have to
occasionally craft /usr/local/sbin/all in order to reflect which files I want
to be editing and making sure all the git pulling and pushing is occurring
correctly. But once it's tweaked, it makes day-to-day work enormously simpler
and you just think to do things you normally wouldn't because they've become so
much easier.
