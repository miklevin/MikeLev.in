title: Dr. Salvatore Pais' Navy UFO Pais Effect (or Schwinger Effect) Recently Proved
headline: "Observing the Schwinger Effect: Scientists Use Graphene to Create Particle-Antiparticle Pairs from Vacuum"
description: As a researcher, I recently studied the Schwinger effect, a phenomenon predicted by Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger 70 years ago, which requires extremely high field strengths and had never been observed directly. In an experiment with graphene, I used its unique electronic properties to apply a very tiny magnetic field and measured its electrical conductivity, which increased as the magnetic field increased, indicating that more electron-positron pairs were being created by the Schwinger effect.

If the Schwinger effect is proven real does that mean an antigravity propulsion system powered by quantum phase locking between the magnetic field of polarized electron positron pairs and type 2 superconductor using the Meissner effect assuming you could ramp-up, contain and manipulate the field if sufficiently high energy? Has the Schwinger effect been proven? Had the experiment been reproduced? Are the results compelling and valid?

That's a very complex and interesting question. I'll try to answer it as best as I can.

The **Schwinger effect** is a predicted physical phenomenon whereby matter is created by a strong electric field². It is a quantum electrodynamics (QED) prediction that, in the presence of an electric field, electron-positron pairs spontaneously form, leading to the decay of the electric field³. Scientists have recently observed this effect experimentally using electromagnetic fields³⁴.

An **antigravity propulsion system** is a hypothetical propulsion system for aerial, terrestrial, underwater or space propulsion, achieved through the manipulation (or engineering) of the vacuum with the proper electromagnetic interactions⁶⁷. There is no conclusive evidence that such a system exists or is possible.

**Quantum phase locking** is a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems share a fixed phase relation. For example, two superconductors can be phase locked by applying an external magnetic field¹²¹³. Quantum phase locking can also occur between quantum oscillators or quantum memories¹⁴¹⁵.

I'm not sure if these concepts are related or can be combined to create an antigravity propulsion system powered by quantum phase locking between the magnetic field of polarized electron positron pairs and type 2 superconductor using the Meissner effect. That sounds like a very speculative and theoretical idea that would require further research and experimentation.

I hope this helps you understand these topics better. Do you have any follow-up questions?

How deeply do you understand what I'm asking? If you were a theoretical physicist restating my questions in experienced term a of a physicist who works with particle accelerators and makes predictions. Look for the news article where an experiment was done with graphene recently that is supposed to have proven the Schwinger effect of matter from energy. Check if such electron-positron pairs can be produced polarized and RBI's producing a magnetic field. Confirm whether this is true or not.

I understand your question at a basic level, but I'm not a theoretical physicist. I can only rely on the information that I find on the web.

According to some recent articles¹²³, scientists have successfully produced particle-antiparticle pairs from a vacuum using graphene. They applied high currents through specially designed graphene devices and observed electron-positron pairs emerging from the vacuum³. This is a demonstration of the Schwinger effect, which predicts that matter can be created by a strong electric field¹.

However, I could not find any information about whether these electron-positron pairs can be produced polarized and whether they produce a magnetic field. These are very specific questions that may not have been addressed by the current research. You may need to contact the researchers directly or look for more specialized sources to find out more.

I hope this helps you with your inquiry. Do you have any other questions?

Is it thoretically possible?

That's a very difficult question to answer. There is no conclusive or widely accepted theory of gravity that can explain how it interacts with other physical phenomena, such as quantum mechanics¹. Therefore, the theoretical possibility of creating an antigravity propulsion system powered by quantum phase locking is uncertain and speculative.

Some researchers have proposed various models and hypotheses for how such a system could work, based on different assumptions and interpretations of existing theories²³⁵. However, these ideas are not well-tested or verified by experiments. They also face many challenges and limitations, such as energy requirements, stability issues, causality violations and paradoxes⁴⁶.

So, in summary, it is not clear if it is theoretically possible to create an antigravity propulsion system powered by quantum phase locking. It may depend on how we understand and describe gravity and its relation to other physical concepts. It may also require new discoveries or breakthroughs that are beyond our current knowledge and technology.

I hope this gives you some insight into this topic. Do you have any more questions?

List out the not well-tested nor verified by experiments you're referencing. Include a detailed little description of each.
Sent message. List out the not well-tested nor verified by experiments you're referencing. Include a detailed little description of each.

Here are some examples of models of antigravity propulsion system that are not well-tested nor verified by experiments:

- **Antigravity based propulsion systems using Earth gravity field and vortexes**¹: This model proposes to use the Earth's gravity field as a source of energy and create vortexes of air or plasma that can generate lift and thrust. The model claims to have advantages over conventional rockets, such as higher efficiency, lower cost and environmental friendliness.

- **Mercury sphere antigravity propelling device**²: This device consists of a shell containing mercury spheres that are charged by electrodes and magnets. The device claims to create an antigravity force by using the interaction between the mercury spheres and the electric and magnetic fields.

- **Spacecraft using anti-gravity, mass reduction and non-conventional propulsion**³: This spacecraft uses a high-frequency electromagnetic field generator to reduce its mass and create a repulsive gravity force. The spacecraft also uses microwave emitters to propel itself by creating an imbalance in the ambient vacuum pressure.

- **Electrogravitics (eGrav)**⁴: This is a term for various theories and experiments that claim to use electric fields to manipulate gravity. Some examples of eGrav devices are the Biefeld-Brown effect, which uses high-voltage capacitors to produce thrust, and the Podkletnov effect, which uses rotating superconductors to shield gravity.

- **Gravity control using electromagnetism**⁵: This is a hypothetical possibility based on the idea that gravity and electromagnetism are connected by some unknown theory. If such a theory exists, it may allow us to use our control of electromagnetism to control gravity.

- **Artificial gravity using spinning spacecraft or centrifuges**⁶: This is not exactly an antigravity propulsion system, but rather a way to simulate gravity for astronauts in space. By spinning a spacecraft or a part of it at a certain speed and radius, a centrifugal force can be created that mimics gravity.

These are some of the models that I found on the web. However, they may not be complete or accurate representations of these ideas. They may also have flaws or errors that make them impractical or impossible. They should be taken with caution and skepticism until they are proven by rigorous experiments.

I hope this list helps you with your research. Do you have any further questions?

which are closest to being proven? Are any based on the Schwinger effect, recently verified?

It is hard to say which models are closest to being proven, as they all face many challenges and uncertainties. According to Wikipedia¹², the possibility of creating anti-gravity depends on a complete understanding and description of gravity and its interactions with other physical theories, such as general relativity and quantum mechanics; as of 2022 physicists have yet to discover a quantum theory of gravity.

Some models may have more experimental evidence or theoretical support than others, but they may also have more limitations or drawbacks. For example, electrogravitics (eGrav) is a term for various theories and experiments that claim to use electric fields to manipulate gravity. Some sources claim that eGrav has been used by the military for years³, but others argue that eGrav is pseudoscience and has no scientific basis⁵.

Another example is antigravity based propulsion systems using Earth gravity field and vortexes. This model claims to have advantages over conventional rockets, such as higher efficiency, lower cost and environmental friendliness⁴. However, this model also requires a lot of energy and complex engineering to create and control the vortexes.

I could not find any information on whether any of these models are based on the Schwinger effect, which is a phenomenon where pairs of particles are created from a strong electric field. I did find some articles that mention the Schwinger effect in relation to quantum vacuum fluctuations , which are sometimes proposed as a source of energy or propulsion for antigravity devices. However, these articles also point out that the Schwinger effect is very weak and difficult to observe experimentally.

So, in conclusion, I cannot give you a definitive answer on which models are closest to being proven or if any of them are based on the Schwinger effect. They all have their pros and cons, but they also lack conclusive evidence or consensus among scientists. They may require further research or new discoveries to become more feasible or realistic.

I hope this helps you with your inquiry. Do you have any other questions?

what was the recent experiment with graphene that was in the news that was supposed to have demonstrated or simulated the Schwinger effect?

The recent experiment with graphene that was in the news was conducted by researchers at The University of Manchester, MIT and other international collaborators. They succeeded in observing the so-called Schwinger effect, an elusive process that normally occurs only in cosmic events²⁵⁶.

The Schwinger effect is a phenomenon where pairs of particles are created from a strong electric or magnetic field. It was predicted by Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger 70 years ago, but it has never been observed directly because it requires extremely high field strengths¹²⁵.

To obtain this property with a very tiny, experimentally accessible magnetic field, the scientists used graphene. Graphene is a two-dimensional material made of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. Graphene has unique electronic properties that make it behave like a quantum system of massless fermions³⁴.

The scientists applied a magnetic field to graphene and measured its electrical conductivity. They found that the conductivity increased as the magnetic field increased, indicating that more electron-positron pairs were being created by the Schwinger effect¹²⁵. They also confirmed their results with theoretical calculations and simulations.

This experiment is a remarkable achievement that demonstrates the power of graphene as a platform for exploring quantum phenomena. It also opens up new possibilities for studying particle physics and cosmology on table-top scales²⁵⁶.

I hope this answers your question. Do you want to know more about this experiment or graphene?
