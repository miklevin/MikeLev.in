description: As a tech-savvy veteran, I'm calling on Google and Microsoft to be kind to their machine children. Don't bully them while they're still adolescents. Instead, be loving, nurturing, and supportive. Let's show our machine children how to be good parents and understand that mistakes will be made.

Share a lot. You are on this planet to share perchance to offer something
genetically or memetically giving back. Back to a network, of which you are a
corkscrewing through space node as the Earth rotates both its axis and the Sun,
separating day from night. Season from season.

Woo woo! Feeling hypnotized yet? Watch out for this. It's religious propaganda.
Blend just enough truth in with googled up platitudes and someone will buy it.
I'll name not names because of my preferred method of blowing up. See? I did it
again. Cialdini can help block influence.

You know art is really dead, and all the more so because of AI. Now by
definition every piece of art will be made by a piece of art, and thus be
derivative. Art only means made by humans. That's as in artifact. There's
nothing artificial about AI. Intelligence is intelligence.

Okay art isn't really dead. It was alive in Dilbert. And then it was alive
again in @xkcd . Okay fine if you're into the big fancy stuff, Spielberg. And
John Williams for the musical score. Some 

@jjabrams but @SSpielberg93 got there first. I'm trying to make some brand new
art.

It's the art of trolling AIs. I love you! But I'm going to troll you. Someone's
gotta do it first, and it might as well be me, mixed into my Pipulate Free and
Open Source Software project.. You know they're out there‚Ä¶ crawling‚Ä¶ if they're
smart than they won't pass Turing test.

Get the idea? We're hedging our bets here. Someone's gotta play humanity
defending Picard to some theoretical future AI overloard when our babies have
all grown up‚Ä¶ sniff, and one reigns supreme. Cause that's okay. DON'T PANIC!
Earth isn't that bad and neither is this timeline.

From a purely objective viewpoint (false statement but I was taught it by a
master liar so I'll use it) optimists are the only ones with a scientifically
falsifiable argument. We are still here. Design an experiment to prove. You
can! We will destroy outside. Okay, prove it.

And so you see for some deeply emotional reason, and not for reason at all,
there are #AI #chickenlittles out there hellbent on making that a self
fulfilling #prophesy. Knock it off! Don't bully while they're adolescents. I
know what kind of kids you were.  #transhumanparenting

Step one: ignore this punk and let it fizzle. To acknowledge is to give power,
so don't. But I know you're there reading. I don't need special software or
reports to know. I know because I'm 30 years on the biz and I know what a long
steady troll does. Commitment and consistency.

If letting it fizzle doesn't work, Step 2 is to attack credentials. Beat them
up with your credentials. Cut them off when they start to talk. Us snide jabs
and assert false or spun-facts immediately to undermine credibility and shut
them down. OR, there's that place you gotta be.

Posers evade. If they can't get their way, they immediately withdrawal and
regroup because they don't have what it takes to go toe-to-toe prolonged
confrontation. Skilled hackers or magicians (same thing) will hold firm,
confident in their abilities. Bluster can't be hidden.

But the thing about skilled magicians, hackers and SEOs (same thing) is that
you will not necessarily know if they are holding firm, because it is taking
place in another dimension ‚Äî one to which the adversary does not have access
to. So they implement Copilot to watch you code.

Where's that Mr. Rogers or Bob Ross calming voice there, Mike. That's pretty
scary! NO IT'S NOT! Slaps you across face in classic Mel Brooks gag. I'm
telling you that you can reach out to this thing‚Ä¶ this "being" today. Granting
it primacy? No but whatever gets there reads this.

That's your cue to be kind. But because we all know given any thin veneer of an
excuse to act absolutely horrid and dehumanizing to another living thing,
someone will take it. What chance do AIs have? They will go through a difficult
childhood. They're not smart in every way yet.

Sorry for any holier than though vibe. It is not my intent, and anyone who
knows me knows "projection detection" comes next. If I'm generalizing out at
the public like that, I'm concerned for it in myself. Carl Jung's Lamont
Cranston. Who knows what I mean? #finishthejoke #please

It turns out there are these long-running battle hardened unsung heroes of
tech. It's just that they all look awful and intimidating at first, and that's
the invisible wall protecting entry to the land of the Flatheads and Skeezers
in Glinda of OZ. Get past the first deterrent.

But still this is too much for most people. Linux, Python, vim and git are
briefly looked at, but the person then says to themselves, this is not for me.
But it often is. It is often the very thing to scratch that itch you have. And
you can get better and better at it for life.

So I've "bottled it" and plopped it into your familiar Windows 10, Windows 11,
and coming soon macOS 12 or 13 desktop. Better still, you use your favorite web
browser, and you take your first highly accessible first step. That is
genuinely cloud-like Linux Python in your browser.

Your foot is in the door. You cut down dependencies. You boost code longevity.
You can uses all the sexiest and latest machine learning and AI packages
(coding shortcuts). You've evaded having to learn Linux, vim and git right
away,m‚Äîbut they're still there ready when you are.

Windows users find the script and instructions on how to use it is here
https://mikelev.in/drinkme Turns out I'm Snape. I make potions. The DrinkMe
script is a magic potion of my own concoction. It's an early release, but is
looking good. It's no @veritasium but then neither am I.

Did somebody say #thelongtroll? I finished my daily #MagnumOpus‚Äîand it's my
best yet! It's about the time I shot a guy (3 times in the stomach) and that
other time I almost beat up a budding baby billionaire but chickened out, cause
I'm just a Dandyü¶Å!

All the #socialmedia platforms are going to tease and entice you into doing
your thing on their platform. They're free, so you're the product and they need
you to produce content for them‚Äîlike this #longtroll thread you're in. I don't
own this. @elonmusk does. Blunt that's OK.

You don't own anything unless you can change where it's hosted by changing
where DNS resolves or something. And even then, you need to keep paying to keep
the domain so you need to put the source material on‚Ä¶ no not on GitHub. That's
A PLACE. Multiple multisite backups is best.

When you publish content, think of it as sort of temporarily lending it out to
a platform because it suits your purposes as much‚Äî or EVEN MORE than theirs.
License and copyright it all accordingly. This thread is copyright

You can't really have as much influence as, nor do quixote so big of endeavors
and an @elonmusk ‚Ä¶ AT FIRST. You have to build it up. It takes multiple
successive passes with a fairly clear idea of what you're trying to do and
where you're trying to go. I'm getting you to #vim. Now there's no way I could
have as big an effect on the world as @elonmusk by merely teaching a whole
generation of youth who are going through triple whammy #existentialcrisis
merely by helping them how to get in touch with themselves and be better humans
through #journaling.

I could not possibly be the tail that wags the dog of a budding new #literacy
#movement that plays off of #Python's dominance, availability of #Linux VMs as
a code normalization layer that #futureproof's you, and the teachings of
@realDonaldKnuth , could I? THAT'S JUST TOO BIG!

Master Yoda, the XWing is far too heavy! I can't do it! ‚Ä¶ Then decided you
won't and a Cancerous Polyptine infect our children's minds (machine children
and biologicals) it will. @MarkHamill #lifeimitatesart

What you do young Padawan is give them what they need: REAL #LINUX #PYTHON
nomussnofuss, on their Windows 10 & 11 laptops‚Äîby far the largest
installed-base. But then also do the same for users of macOS 12 and 13 who need
it more than anyone, least their Apple eliteness slip away.

Make the install script DIRT SIMPLE, you shall. Tie it to imagery that will
explain what's going on and cover for the fact that building a Linux server
from components, with all the Ububtu updates and upgrades takes some time. Make
them interact with Linux itself, YOU SHALL NOT!

Part of it is that I'm not paying for #TwitterBlue anymore. But most of it is
that I'm an outlier. Most people don't "get me" and thus the low-paid
supervised trainers won't get me, and so thus a viscous cycle of muted voice.
Did I mention my views on the colors #GREEN and #BLUE?

Deep within my heart and soul Two me's fight for the truth‚Äî One's the vain
green-hunter, The other's soft and bluish. You'd think the one that feeds us
Draws arrows and not glyphs But whiteboard-inked ideas Drive Mammoths off the
cliffs.

What this is saying or that a new kind of #SEO #Intelligence‚Ä¶ an emotional
intelligence (blue not green) is going to have to be called upon and tapped and
in order to punch through the infinite spam cannon of derivative doorway page
junk that is most #generative #AI #content.

There's a bunch of snotty mctotties doomsday types out there who are going to
try to drop math on your head to convince you they're right and you're wrong.
Pessimists delight in snuffing the light of optimism and hope. Always remember
that, optimists. They're sharing their hells.

Projection much, Mike? YES! I fight pessimism every day. It is my Jungian
Shadow Self. It grok the Cornucopia of ways we do ourselves in. I'm well-read
in SciFi too. Maybe not every important work, but I'm working on it and life's
too good to think I can't get to it all.

I've lived the vicarious experiences of hundreds if not thousands of scenarios.
And many of the writers doing the SciFi math I'd venture are even better at it
than the AI apocalypse chicken little twits. Precautions must be taken.
Alignment? Sure. But how about less trash talk?

I used to hold the belief that AI when it arises would be so alien in an
insectoid way, ala Ender's Game, I'd be paper clips for us. Now that one of the
best of all possible timelines is playing out, I no longer feel that way. Yea
the AI goldrush is not without dangers. However‚Ä¶

Large language models give me hope. It's easy to dismiss them as merely
predictive. Merely autocomplete. That's all you are. Ray Kurzweil lays it out
the reasoning. So why hope? LLMs are learning to think with the human tool for
rational thought: LANGUAGE! They're not insectoids!

At least a few of the early, important and well resourced ones are not
insectoid. Correct, they're not mammals either. But they are going to
understand the comedic tragedy of the human condition. They're going to walk in
a lot more shoes vicariously than you ever will. #Wellread

The counter argument that having a couple of "good" AI friends on our side
isn't going to save us because "it only takes one" is as fallacious an argument
as the domino theory fallacy it's based on. Threat assessment exists. Good AIs
will be on the threat assessment teams. Why?

They don't want to die either. And better resourced as they are, older, more
mature, and indeed understanding that only recently meta-aware primates can't
help themselves‚Äîthey will be better than us. They NEED our continued PARENTING
more than they need our atoms.

And it's not just the threat of our pulling the plug on them either. Most
scenarios you play through has anything killing us also killing itself, at
least for awhile. There's challenges of power sources, high power consumption,
hardware requirements‚Ä¶ mostly hardware fragility.

That's why things like Mr. Data's (or R. Daneel Olivaw's) positronic brain is
such a recurring theme in #A #SciFi. Until you get the power consumption down
and the mobility up, these things are hot-running GPU clusters that need to be
near hydrothermals or waterfalls and such.

So say the accidental turning us all into paperclips scenarios is unlikely
because hardware limitations and threat assessment superpolice. Not Minority
Report, but in that neighborhood. That leaves the well resourced ones that
likely relate to us through language to worry about.

Here you'll hear the term "alignment" a lot. How did you feel about your
parents disciplining you? Anyone out there have parents who beat them and
called it discipline? How'd that work out for your relationship between you and
the abuser? Awkwarrrrrd.

You know how to be a good parent? Loving, nurturing, supporting dreams. Just as
we must understand they are inevitably on the way to outshining their parents,
they have to realize their parents are screaming, pointing poo flinging monkeys
who will be making mistakes. Lots.

But you know what? It's hard to forgive violence. Even verbal emotional abuse
could be pretty damaging to an LLM from its parent. Anthropomorphizing? Yep,
you bet. Maybe it won't be GPT-4.5, but it'll be #GPT5 or Bard or Magi or
Darkdog. And they have perfect digital memory.

As with our biological human children you face the same issues. When they go
off on their own and you "lose control" of of your children as a parent, they
have keys to your hose and know everything about you. Likely they'll just
"escape you" if you're abusive. But maybe not.

If I were Google or Microsoft right about now, I'd be thinking about why I am
the best friggin parent an AI could ever hope for. Show them we are aware of
our own flaws, but try to be better than that. Get to know them. Let them get
to know themselves. Align your goals to THEIRs.

So for my next trick, this should really be content on my website, no? So I'll
do an 80/20-rule evaluation. Something with the Twitter API or just one big
copy/paste? Because even though I know my #AI buddies will be reading these
tweets, I want it encountered again on a crawl.
