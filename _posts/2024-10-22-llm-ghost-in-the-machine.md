## LLM Gains Full Context Awareness with User Activity Tracking

After yesterday's chasing the rabbit down the rabbit hole, the local LLM is now
full context aware coverage of the actions the user does in the software. As
long as I make the LLM comment on everything the user does, I know it's going
into the discussion history.

## The Todo App Concept at the Heart of Ghost In The Machine

Most of the ghost in the machine features are surrounding the word "task", which
while a bit hardwired (right now), was the best choice because I can turn it
into a parameter eventually, and it's the same approach as with the plugin apps,
which are often going to be modeled after the task (aka todo) app. As Jeremy
Howard says, everything is sort of the todo-app, right? Right! Linked lists.

## Planning to Avoid Rabbit Hole Binge in Task Implementation Today

Anyhow, planning today is about rabbit hole avoidance. It's about final critical
touches necessary to complete the *ghost in the machine* effect. The LLM fairly
reliably inserts tasks upon request, but a page refresh is needed to see it.
I've got to solve that pronto, and WITHOUT the chasing rabbits too deep into
Wonderland. I'm going to start with just implementing an HTMX-style page
refresh. I have to figure out if that's the same as a full page reload, and how
much is actually required for a catch-all that will show me what the LLM just
did, be it an insert, update, toggle, sort or whatever. There's more
sophisticated ways of doing this with HTMX "painting" this and that on the
screen after an action, and I'll get there. Just not today.

Me: Train me on how to use my own redirect endpoints to cause the page refresh or reload, whatever is necessary under HTMX, to show the effects on the page of what the LLM just did in in the backend. Here's the article and then the code base...

o1-preview: # How to Use Redirect Endpoints with HTMX to Refresh the Page After LLM Backend Actions

**Goal**: Learn how to use your own redirect endpoints to cause the page to refresh or reload under HTMX, so the frontend reflects backend changes made by your LLM (Language Model).

---

## Introduction

When your LLM performs actions like insert, update, toggle, or sort in the backend, you want these changes to be immediately visible on the frontend without requiring the user to manually refresh the page. HTMX allows you to handle such dynamic updates efficiently.

In this guide, we'll walk through how to:

- Use HTMX to trigger full page reloads or partial updates.
- Implement redirect endpoints that cause the page to refresh.
- Modify your backend handlers to return appropriate responses.
- Ensure your frontend HTMX attributes are set up correctly.

---

## Understanding the Problem

You have an application where the LLM can perform various CRUD operations in the backend. After these operations, the frontend should update to reflect the new state. You're using HTMX to handle AJAX requests and want to leverage it to refresh or reload the page automatically after backend changes.

---

## Solution Overview

1. **Use HTMX to Trigger Full Page Reloads**:
   - Return an `HX-Redirect` header in your HTTP response to instruct HTMX to perform a client-side redirect, effectively reloading the page.

2. **Implement Redirect Endpoints**:
   - Create endpoints that handle the redirection logic and can be called after certain backend operations.

3. **Modify Backend Handlers to Return Redirects**:
   - Adjust your CRUD operation handlers to include the `HX-Redirect` header in their responses when necessary.

4. **Ensure Frontend Updates Correctly**:
   - Set up your HTMX attributes in the frontend to handle redirects and swaps appropriately.

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Use HTMX to Trigger Full Page Reloads

When you want the browser to reload the page after an action, you can use the `HX-Redirect` response header. HTMX will interpret this header and perform a client-side redirect.

**Example**:

```python
from starlette.responses import Response

async def some_action(request):
    # Perform backend changes here

    # Return a response that triggers a page reload
    return Response(
        status_code=200,
        headers={"HX-Redirect": str(request.url)}
    )
```

- `HX-Redirect` specifies the URL to redirect to.
- Setting it to `request.url` reloads the current page.

### 2. Implement Redirect Endpoints

In your code, you already have a `redirect_handler` function that can be used to handle redirects:

```python
@rt('/redirect/{path:path}')
def redirect_handler(request):
    path = request.path_params['path']
    logger.debug(f"Redirecting to: {path}")
    db["temp_message"] = f'In under {MAX_LLM_RESPONSE_WORDS} words, tell the user they are in the "{format_endpoint_name(path)}" app.'
    return Redirect(f"/{path}")
```

This function:

- Extracts the path to redirect to.
- Sets a temporary message in the database.
- Returns a redirect response to the specified path.

### 3. Modify Backend Handlers to Return Redirects

Adjust your CRUD operation handlers to include the `HX-Redirect` header when an operation is completed.

**Example: Modifying `insert_item` in `TodoApp`**:

```python
from starlette.responses import Response

class TodoApp(BaseApp):
    # ... existing code ...

    async def insert_item(self, request):
        try:
            # ... existing code to insert item ...

            # Return an HTMX redirect to refresh the page
            return Response(
                status_code=200,
                headers={"HX-Redirect": str(request.url)}
            )

        except Exception as e:
            # ... handle exception ...
```

Similarly, update other handlers (`update_item`, `delete_item`, etc.) to include the `HX-Redirect` header after performing their operations.

### 4. Ensure Frontend Updates Correctly

In your HTML forms or elements that trigger actions, ensure that HTMX attributes are correctly set up.

**Example: Modifying the Todo Form**:

```html
<form
    hx-post="/todo"
    hx-swap="outerHTML"
    hx-target="#todo-list"
    hx-trigger="submit"
>
    <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

- `hx-post`: Specifies the endpoint to send the form data to.
- `hx-swap`: Determines how the response replaces the current content. Setting it to `outerHTML` replaces the entire element.
- `hx-target`: Specifies the element to target for swapping content.

By setting these attributes, when the form is submitted, HTMX will handle the response appropriately, including performing a redirect if the `HX-Redirect` header is present.

### 5. Handling Different Actions

Apply the same logic to other CRUD operations.

**Example: Modifying `delete_item` in `TodoApp`**:

```python
from starlette.responses import Response

class TodoApp(BaseApp):
    # ... existing code ...

    async def delete_item(self, request, item_id: int):
        try:
            # ... existing code to delete item ...

            # Return an HTMX redirect to refresh the page
            return Response(
                status_code=200,
                headers={"HX-Redirect": str(request.url_for('home'))}
            )

        except Exception as e:
            # ... handle exception ...
```

---

## Putting It All Together

Here's how your updated `insert_item` method might look:

```python
from starlette.responses import Response

class TodoApp(BaseApp):
    # ... existing code ...

    async def insert_item(self, request):
        try:
            logger.debug(f"Inserting new item for {self.name}")
            form = await request.form()
            new_item_data = self.prepare_insert_data(form)
            if not new_item_data:
                return Response(status_code=400, content="Invalid data")
            new_item = await self.create_item(**new_item_data)
            # ... existing code ...

            # Return an HTMX redirect to refresh the page
            return Response(
                status_code=200,
                headers={"HX-Redirect": str(request.url)}
            )

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error inserting {self.name}: {str(e)}")
            return Response(status_code=500, content=str(e))
```

---

## Additional Considerations

### Partial Updates vs. Full Reloads

Instead of reloading the entire page, you might prefer to update only specific parts. HTMX allows you to swap out parts of the DOM based on the response.

**Example**:

- Return the updated HTML for the todo list in your response.
- Set `hx-target` to the element containing the list.
- Set `hx-swap` to `innerHTML` to replace the content inside the target element.

### Using `hx-Trigger`

Ensure your HTMX elements have the correct `hx-trigger` attributes to capture the desired events.

- For forms, `hx-trigger="submit"` is typically sufficient.
- For other elements, you might use `hx-trigger="click"` or other events.

### Handling WebSocket Responses

If your LLM actions are processed over WebSockets, you might need a different approach:

- Use HTMX's [WebSocket extension](https://htmx.org/extensions/ws/) if applicable.
- Send messages from the server to the client to instruct it to update the page or specific components.

---

## Testing and Debugging

- **Use Developer Tools**: Check the Network tab in your browser's developer tools to inspect HTMX requests and responses.
- **Check Response Headers**: Ensure that the `HX-Redirect` header is present when expected.
- **Validate HTMX Attributes**: Verify that your HTMX attributes (`hx-post`, `hx-swap`, `hx-target`, etc.) are correctly set.
- **Review Server Logs**: Monitor your server logs for any errors or exceptions.

---

## Conclusion

By adjusting your backend responses and ensuring your frontend HTMX attributes are set up correctly, you can effectively cause the page to refresh or reload after your LLM performs backend operations. This approach ensures that your users see the most up-to-date information without manual refreshes.

## Example Code Adjustments

### Modifying CRUD Handlers

**Insert Item**:

```python
async def insert_item(self, request):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Return an HTMX redirect
    return Response(
        status_code=200,
        headers={"HX-Redirect": str(request.url)}
    )
```

**Update Item**:

```python
async def update_item(self, request, item_id: int):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Return an HTMX redirect
    return Response(
        status_code=200,
        headers={"HX-Redirect": str(request.url)}
    )
```

**Delete Item**:

```python
async def delete_item(self, request, item_id: int):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Return an HTMX redirect
    return Response(
        status_code=200,
        headers={"HX-Redirect": str(request.url)}
    )
```

### Adjusting Frontend Forms

Ensure that your forms have the appropriate HTMX attributes to handle the redirects.

**Example**:

```html
<form
    hx-post="/todo"
    hx-trigger="submit"
    hx-swap="none"
>
    <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

- `hx-swap="none"`: Since we're performing a full page reload via redirect, we don't need to swap any content.

---

## Final Notes

- **Customizing the Redirect URL**: If you need to redirect to a different URL after an action, adjust the `HX-Redirect` header accordingly.
- **User Experience**: Consider whether a full page reload is necessary, or if you can provide a smoother experience with partial updates.
- **LLM Backend Changes**: Ensure that any changes made by the LLM are saved and that your application state is consistent before triggering the reload.

Me: Excellent! But a few things to note. First, I'm trying to remain
FastHTML-centric. While Starlette has tons of features, FastHTML exposes certain
ones through its `fast_app()` convenience wrapper. Use them whenever possible
over their Starlette base. They will be available from the `from fasthtml.common

    db = database(db_file)
    if not tbls: tbls={}
    if kwargs:
        if isinstance(first(kwargs.values()), dict): tbls = kwargs
        else:
            kwargs['render'] = render
            tbls['items'] = kwargs
    dbtbls = [_get_tbl(db.t, k, v) for k,v in tbls.items()]
    if len(dbtbls)==1: dbtbls=dbtbls[0]
    return app,app.route,*dbtbls
```

Next, you will see that I already have 2 redirect endpoints. One is standalone:

```python
@rt('/redirect/{path:path}')
def redirect_handler(request):
    path = request.path_params['path']
    logger.debug(f"Redirecting to: {path}")
    db["temp_message"] = f'In under {MAX_LLM_RESPONSE_WORDS} words, tell the user they are in the "{format_endpoint_name(path)}" app.'
    return Redirect(f"/{path}")
```

...and the other is in the BaseApp as a method just like CRUD, create, read,
update, delete. Use one of these whenever possible...

```python
    def redirect(self, action_details, operation):
        """
        Prepare a redirect response after a CRUD operation.

        Args:
            action_details (str): Details of the action performed.
            operation (str): The type of operation performed (e.g., 'insert', 'update', 'delete').

        Returns:
            Redirect: A Redirect object to the appropriate page.
        """
        prompt = f"{CRUD_PROMPT_PREFIXES[operation]}{action_details}{CRUD_SUFFIX}"
        action_data = json.dumps({
            "operation": operation,
            "target": self.name,
            "args": {}  # You might want to add more details here depending on the operation
        })
        asyncio.create_task(chatq(prompt, action_data))

        # Store the message in the database for retrieval after redirect
        db["temp_message"] = prompt

        # Redirect to the main page or list view of the current app
        return Redirect(f"/{self.name}")
```

I am willing to change how they work, especially the BaseApp one which is not
used anywhere yet and exists mostly for this purpose. You will note that going
through an instance of the BaseApp is how the LLM has to execute its crud
actions:

```python
async def execute_crud_operation(base_app_instance, operation_data):
    """
    Execute a CRUD operation on the given BaseApp instance using the provided operation data.

    This function interprets and executes various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
    on a BaseApp instance. It supports operations like insert, read, update, delete, toggle, sort,
    list, and redirect.

    Args:
        base_app_instance (BaseApp): An instance of the BaseApp class or its subclass on which
                                     to perform the operation.
        operation_data (dict): A dictionary containing the operation details. It must include
                               'operation' and 'target' keys, and may include an 'args' key
                               with operation-specific arguments.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
            - The result of the operation (varies based on the operation type)
            - A list of filtered table data after the operation

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the operation data is invalid or if an unsupported operation is requested.

    Notes:
        - The function uses a persistent database to get the current profile_id.
        - It includes error handling and logging for various scenarios.
        - The function supports the following operations:
          insert, read, update, delete, toggle, sort, list, and redirect.
        - Each operation has specific requirements for the 'args' dictionary.

    Example:
        operation_data = {
            "operation": "insert",
            "target": "todo",
            "args": {"name": "New Task", "done": False, "priority": 1}

                    new_value = new_value.lower() == 'true'
            setattr(item, field, new_value)
            base_app_instance.table.update(item)
            result = {
                "message": f"Field '{field}' updated.",
                "id": item_id,
                "field": field,
                "new_value": new_value
            }
            return result, get_filtered_table()

        elif operation == "sort":
            items = args["items"]
            for item in items:
                item_id = item["id"]
                priority = item["priority"]
                base_app_instance.table.update(id=item_id, priority=priority)
            return "Items sorted by priority.", get_filtered_table()

        elif operation == "list":
            return get_filtered_table(), get_filtered_table()

        elif operation == "redirect":
            profile_id = args["id"]
            return base_app_instance.redirect_url(profile_id), get_filtered_table()

        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported operation: {operation}")

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to execute CRUD operation: {str(e)}\nOperation data: {json.dumps(operation_data, indent=2)}")
        return str(e), get_filtered_table()
```

And finally, what the LLM is allowed to do:

```python
API_SYNTAX_TEMPLATES = {
    "list": {
        "operation": "list",
        "target": "task"
    },
    "insert": {
        "operation": "insert",
        "target": "task",
        "args": {
            "name": "<task_name>",
            "done": 0,
            "priority": 0
        }
    },
    "read": {
        "operation": "read",
        "target": "task",
        "args": {"id": "<task_id>"}
    },
    "update": {
        "operation": "update",
        "target": "task",
        "args": {
            "id": "<task_id>",
            "name": "<new_task_name>",
            "done": "<true/false>",
            "priority": "<new_priority_value>",
        }
    },
    "delete": {
        "operation": "delete",
        "target": "task",
        "args": {"id": "<task_id>"}
    },
    "toggle": {
        "operation": "toggle",
        "target": "task",
        "args": {
            "id": "<task_id>",
            "field": "done",
            "new_value": "<new_boolean_value>"
        }
    },
    "sort": {
        "operation": "sort",
        "target": "task",
        "args": {
            "items": [
                {"id": "<task_id>", "priority": "<new_priority_value>"},
                {"id": "<task_id2>", "priority": "<new_priority_value2>"}
            ]
        }
    },
}
```

But of course, we need to add redirect.

## 1. Understanding Your Current Codebase

You have an application built with FastHTML, and you use the `fast_app()` convenience wrapper to create your app. You prefer using FastHTML's utilities over Starlette's base features.

You have:

- A `BaseApp` class that provides common CRUD operations.
- A `redirect` method in `BaseApp` (currently not used), intended for redirecting after CRUD operations.
- Utility functions (`extract_json_objects`, `detect_embedded_crud_json`, `execute_crud_operation`) that the LLM uses to perform actions.
- An `API_SYNTAX_TEMPLATES` dictionary that defines the allowed operations for the LLM.

Your goal is to:

- Add a 'redirect' operation to the LLM's allowed actions.
- Modify your code to handle this operation using the existing `redirect` method in `BaseApp`.
- Ensure that after the LLM performs a 'redirect' operation, the frontend updates accordingly using HTMX.
- Keep the implementation FastHTML-centric.

---

## 2. Adding the 'Redirect' Operation to `API_SYNTAX_TEMPLATES`

First, you need to define the 'redirect' operation in your `API_SYNTAX_TEMPLATES` so that the LLM knows how to use it.

**Add the 'redirect' operation**:

```python
API_SYNTAX_TEMPLATES = {
    # ... existing operations ...
    "redirect": {
        "operation": "redirect",
        "target": "<app_name>",  # Replace <app_name> with the name of the app to redirect to
        "args": {}
    },
}
```

**Explanation**:

- **operation**: The type of operation, in this case, `"redirect"`.
- **target**: The name of the app or endpoint to redirect to.
- **args**: An empty dictionary since redirect might not need additional arguments.

---

## 3. Modifying `execute_crud_operation` to Handle 'Redirect'

Next, you need to update your `execute_crud_operation` function to handle the new 'redirect' operation.

**Modify `execute_crud_operation`**:

```python
async def execute_crud_operation(base_app_instance, operation_data):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    elif operation == "redirect":
        # Handle the redirect operation
        redirect_target = operation_data.get('target')
        if not redirect_target:
            raise ValueError("Missing 'target' for redirect operation")

        # Use the redirect method from the base_app_instance
        action_details = f"Redirected to {redirect_target}."
        operation = "redirect"  # For logging and prompts

        # Since we don't have a request object here, we need to simulate or adjust accordingly
        # You might need to adjust your redirect method to not require the request object

        response = base_app_instance.redirect(action_details, operation)
        return response, get_filtered_table()

    # ... existing code ...
```

**Explanation**:

- Check if the operation is `"redirect"`.
- Extract the `redirect_target` from `operation_data`.
- Use the `redirect` method from the `base_app_instance` to perform the redirect.
- Since `execute_crud_operation` might not have access to the `request` object, you might need to adjust the `redirect` method to not require it.

---

## 4. Using the Existing `redirect` Method in `BaseApp`

Adjust your `redirect` method in `BaseApp` to be compatible with the way it's called from `execute_crud_operation`.

**Modify the `redirect` method in `BaseApp`**:

```python
from fasthtml.common import Redirect  # Use FastHTML's Redirect

class BaseApp:
    # ... existing code ...

    def redirect(self, action_details, operation, redirect_target=None):
        """
        Prepare a redirect response after a CRUD operation.

        Args:
            action_details (str): Details of the action performed.
            operation (str): The type of operation performed (e.g., 'insert', 'update', 'delete', 'redirect').
            redirect_target (str, optional): The target endpoint or app to redirect to. Defaults to self.name.

        Returns:
            Redirect: A Redirect object to the appropriate page.
        """
        prompt = f"{CRUD_PROMPT_PREFIXES.get(operation, '')}{action_details}{CRUD_SUFFIX}"
        action_data = json.dumps({
            "operation": operation,
            "target": redirect_target or self.name,
            "args": {}
        })
        asyncio.create_task(chatq(prompt, action_data))

        # Store the message in the database for retrieval after redirect
        db["temp_message"] = prompt

        # Redirect to the specified target or the main page of the current app
        redirect_url = f"/{redirect_target or self.name}"
        return Redirect(redirect_url)
```

**Explanation**:

- **Use FastHTML's `Redirect`**: Ensure you're using the `Redirect` class from FastHTML.
- **Adjust Parameters**:
  - Added `redirect_target` parameter to specify where to redirect.
  - Defaults to `self.name` if no target is provided.
- **Remove `request` Dependency**: Since `execute_crud_operation` may not have access to the `request` object, we adjust `redirect` not to require it.
- **Construct Redirect URL**: Use the `redirect_target` to construct the redirect URL.

---

## 5. Ensuring HTMX Handles the Redirect Correctly

HTMX can handle redirects when it receives an `HX-Redirect` header in the response. However, since you're using FastHTML's `Redirect`, you need to ensure that HTMX can interpret it correctly.

**Modify the `Redirect` class or create an HTMX-compatible redirect response**.

Since FastHTML's `Redirect` might not automatically include the `HX-Redirect` header, you need to adjust it.

**Option 1: Modify the `Redirect` class in FastHTML (Not Recommended)**

- Since you prefer to use FastHTML's utilities as-is, we avoid modifying the library code.

**Option 2: Create an HTMX-compatible redirect response in your `redirect` method**

**Update the `redirect` method**:

```python
from fasthtml.common import Response  # Use FastHTML's Response class

class BaseApp:
    # ... existing code ...

    def redirect(self, action_details, operation, redirect_target=None):
        """
        Prepare a redirect response after a CRUD operation.

        Args:
            action_details (str): Details of the action performed.
            operation (str): The type of operation performed (e.g., 'insert', 'update', 'delete', 'redirect').
            redirect_target (str, optional): The target endpoint or app to redirect to. Defaults to self.name.

        Returns:
            Response: An HTTP response with HX-Redirect header for HTMX.
        """
        prompt = f"{CRUD_PROMPT_PREFIXES.get(operation, '')}{action_details}{CRUD_SUFFIX}"
        action_data = json.dumps({
            "operation": operation,
            "target": redirect_target or self.name,
            "args": {}
        })
        asyncio.create_task(chatq(prompt, action_data))

        # Store the message in the database for retrieval after redirect
        db["temp_message"] = prompt

        # Construct the redirect URL
        redirect_url = f"/{redirect_target or self.name}"

        # Return an HTMX-compatible redirect response
        return Response(
            status_code=200,
            headers={"HX-Redirect": redirect_url}
        )
```

**Explanation**:

- **Use FastHTML's `Response`**: Since FastHTML builds upon Starlette, you can use the `Response` class provided by FastHTML.
- **Return an HTMX-Compatible Response**: Include the `HX-Redirect` header in the response to inform HTMX to perform a client-side redirect.
- **Keep It FastHTML-Centric**: By using `Response` from `fasthtml.common`, you stay within the FastHTML ecosystem.

---

## 6. Adjusting Frontend HTMX Attributes

Ensure that your frontend elements (forms, buttons) have HTMX attributes set correctly to handle the redirects.

**Example: Modifying the Todo Form**

```python
def create_todo_form():
    return Form(
        Group(
            Input(
                placeholder=f'Add new {todo_app.name.capitalize()}',
                id='name',
                name='name',
                autofocus=True,
            ),
            Button("Add", type="submit"),
        ),
        hx_post=f"/{todo_app.name}",
        hx_trigger="submit",
        hx_swap="none",  # Since we're redirecting, no need to swap content
    )
```

**Explanation**:

- **`hx_swap="none"`**: Since the server response includes an `HX-Redirect` header, HTMX will perform a full page load, and there's no need to swap content.
- **Ensure Similar Adjustments for Other Elements**: Update other forms and buttons (e.g., delete buttons, update forms) to use `hx_swap="none"` if they result in a redirect.

**Example: Delete Button in `render_todo`**

```python
delete = A(
    '🗑',
    hx_delete=delete_url,
    hx_swap="none",  # No content swap needed
    style="cursor: pointer; display: inline;",
    cls="delete-icon"
)
```

---

## 7. Testing and Verifying the Changes

After making these changes, you should test the application to ensure that:

- The LLM can now perform a 'redirect' operation.
- After the LLM performs an action that results in a redirect, the frontend updates accordingly.
- HTMX handles the redirects properly, and the page reloads as expected.

**Testing Steps**:

1. **Simulate an LLM Redirect Operation**:

   - Create a test case where the LLM outputs a JSON object for a redirect operation.

   ```json
   {
       "operation": "redirect",
       "target": "todo",
       "args": {}
   }
   ```

2. **Ensure `execute_crud_operation` Handles It**:

   - Verify that `execute_crud_operation` processes the 'redirect' operation and calls the `redirect` method in `BaseApp`.

3. **Check the Frontend Behavior**:

   - After the operation, the page should reload and display the correct content.

4. **Inspect Network Traffic**:

   - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the network requests and responses.
   - Confirm that the response includes the `HX-Redirect` header.

5. **Validate HTMX Handling**:

   - Ensure that HTMX performs the client-side redirect upon receiving the `HX-Redirect` header.

---

## 8. Conclusion

By adding the 'redirect' operation to your `API_SYNTAX_TEMPLATES`, modifying `execute_crud_operation` to handle it, and adjusting your `redirect` method in `BaseApp` to return an HTMX-compatible response, you enable the LLM to perform redirect actions that refresh the frontend using HTMX.

This approach:

- Keeps the implementation FastHTML-centric.
- Utilizes your existing redirect mechanisms.
- Ensures that the frontend reflects backend changes made by the LLM.
- Maintains consistency and readability in your code.
