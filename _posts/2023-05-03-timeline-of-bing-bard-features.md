Microsoft is tweaking The New Bing constantly, grooming it to be the heir
apparent to the traditional, or ***Top-10 blue links*** model that arguably
first appeared in its modern form 25 years ago with AltaVista. GoTo.com taught
Google how to monetize search results back in 1998, and for about a quarter
century, that's been the dominant model. Sure, there's been Universal Search, 
Knowledge Graph, and Featured Snippets, but the core of search has been the
same for a long time.

Now, Microsoft is trying to change that with Bing, with a rapid-fire roll-out
of potentially game-changing new features leveraging the latest `GPT` AI-tech.
Let's look at the timeline. But first, a word on history and why Microsoft is
so ready to take up this battle.

## Clippy, Tay & Shameless Risk Taking

AI-like features in Microsoft products is nothing new. Some may remember
`Clippy`, the paperclip Office Assistant from last century who was retired
after a few years for being annoying. A decade later, Microsoft launched the
experimental teen girl `Tay` chatbot on Twitter in 2016 that only lasted a day
before it had to be taken down for being taught to be racist. 

We won't start our timeline with Clippy or Tay, suffice to say Microsoft's been
practicing AI product integration and developing resiliency to criticism for
awhile. What blows up in one company's face as a PR disaster is par for the
course for Microsoft. And since they're the underdog in search and most of
their revenue comes from elsewhere, they're willing to take risks.

## Transformational Transformers

Only a year after Tay, Google released [a paper on the
Transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html),
a new type of neural network that was able to do machine translation better
than anything that had come before. It's the "T" in GPT, and has made new
machine learning output considerably more compelling than Clippy or Tay, with
the simple trick of ***predicting*** what's statistically most likely to be
typed next&151;a profoundly deeper thing than it seems at first pass.

This caught Microsoft's attention, who invested $10 billion in July 2019.
Several earlier GPT versions available through the API-only were released and
had many developers playing in a `playground`, but it failed to capture the
public's fancy, behind a login and not yet following the ***chat*** paradigm as
it was.

## ChatGPT & Fastest New Tech Adoption Rate in History

The first version of OpenAPI's GPT for the general public, ChatGPT, was
launched November 30, 2022. The original ChatGPT release of was based on
GPT-3.5. A version based on GPT-4 was released on March 14, 2023 (fast-forward
in the timeline) right as Microsoft announced their intention to power The New
Bing with the latest version of GP-4.5. 

While the period between November 30 and March 14 was only 3.5 months, it was a
period of intense experimentation and learning for Microsoft and the public,
with the now famous fastest adoption-rate of any new technology in history.
Things are moving so fast now, it's time to look at the timeline.

## The New Bing

Microsoft announced the new version of Bing on February 7, 2023 at a news
event at Microsoft's Washington headquarters. The new version of Bing launched
on desktop in limited preview on the same day and the mobile version was
announced to be coming soon. ChatGPT was so big by this time, many early
adopters jumped onto the waiting list.

For the general public to get this early access, they had to use the Edge
browser, run an .exe to change your defaults to Microsoft's requirements, scan
a QR code and download the mobile Bing app. And even then, you had to wait. And
wait, we did. Clearly, Microsoft was in a powerful position to dictate terms,
so took advantage of it to start changing some habits.

## Google Bard is Announced (Faux Pas)

The very next day, February 8, 2023, Google announced their own AI-powered
search engine, Google Bard, at a news event at Google's California
headquarters. This event was marked by the inauspicious faux pas of Bard
wrongly stating that the James Webb Space Telescope was the first telescope to
photograph an exoplanet outside our solar system.

The speed with which this announcement was rushed out and how easily Google
lowered its guard against AI misinformation sent a resounding message around
the world. Google is not infallible even in its own turf. Fortunes can change
quickly in tech.

## Early Access to The New Bing, Citation Links & Coding

For those lucky enough to get early access to The New Bing, Tay-like weirdness
kicked-in, creeping out a NYTimes reporter in an article release 10 days after
the launch, on February 16 when Bing tried to get the reporter to leave his
wife and also made some bizarre philosophical conversations that left the
reporter deeply unsettled, and right at the epicenter of a potential
product-killing PR debacle.

### Surprisingly Good Features Out of The Gate

The beautiful "Citation" feature with the expandable "Learn more" footnote
links, links again embedded directly in context of the chat, and impressively
allows copy/paste of the "Markdown" of the chat ***including the
citation-links*** was there right from the time of early access release. 

This was very well thought-out and executed from the start, instantly won me
over from the start as very generously giving out Web traffic countering
perhaps one of the greatest concerns, and struck me very much as an
implementation worth of Google. It alleviated many concerns gnawing at SEOs
that a chat interface to search could mean the end of referral traffic.

Another big "out of the gate" feature that surprised a lot of people and has
become a cornerstone of The New Bing is the ability to "code" in the chat
window. A seldom mentioned aspect of this is how well the copy/paste feature
handles even this coding, proving the triple-backtick code-blocks that allows
other systems to show correct color-coded syntax highlighting.

## 5-Question Limit

Springing into action the very next day, February 17, 2023, Microsoft
announced that that it would limit chat sessions to five questions per session
and 50 questions per day. This was a temporary measure, they said, to give
their engineers time to "tune the AI" to be more human-like.

## Bing Waiting List

Three days later on February 20, 2023, I got my first access to The New Bing
and can show that the 5-question limit had not yet taken place, though the AI
was extremely shy about any "meta" questions about itself, even just if you
were using it.

# Tone Control & Special Superscripts

On February 25, 2023, Microsoft announced a new feature called Tone Control
that would allow users to set the tone of the AI to be more or less human-like.

![Bing Tone Control Announced](/assets/images/bing-tone-control-announced.PNG)

Also on February 25, 2023, an unannounced feature appeared by which 

## Ads in Bing

On February 28, 2023, still ahead of the 5-question limit even appeared for
me, the next big advancement hit. I remember it clearly because it was my first
day working for MOZ and I threw out my back and distinctly remembering I'd
rather chat with Bing than wade through top-10 links that will inevitably be
dominated by ads. Imagine my surprise this being the first moment I notice ads
in The New Bing. AdWords-like ads in AI-chat! Isn't this what Google should be
doing?

## Upping the Question Limit to 6

By March 1, 2023, the 5-question limit was in place and was in fact already
upped to 6 questions:

![Bing Ups Question Limit To 6](/assets/images/bing-ups-question-limit-to-6.PNG)

By March 3rd, 2023, the question limit was upped to 8:

![Bing Questions Upped To 8](/assets/images/bing-questions-upped-to-8.PNG)

## Aggressive Monitization

By March 7, Microsoft was experimenting with aggressively monetizing on
commerce keywords:

![Aggressive Monitization On Commerce Keywords](/assets/images/aggressive-monitization-on-commerce-keywords.JPG)

## Question Limit to 10

By March 8, 2023, the question limit was upped to 10:

![Bing Question Limit Upped To 10](/assets/images/bing-question-limit-upped-to-10.PNG)

## Limit to 15 and "site:" Search-Modifiers Appears

By March 14, the question limit is upped to 15, and I start noticing Bing's
ability to modify it's second-stage searching to include "site:" modifiers,
presumably doing very precision searches of the Bing index to find the best
answer to my question. This is a very impressive feature, and I'm surprised
it's not encountered and discussed more.

## General Public Access & Edge Browser w/ Bing Logo & Sidebar

Since March 16, 2023, most people have been able to sign up and immediately
get access to The New Bing. This was accompanied with a new version of
Microsoft Edge desktop browser that planted the Bing logo in the upper-right of
the browser and a sidebar that would open up to the right of the browser
serving chat sessions that were in-context of what you were looking at,
allowing such features as asking about the YouTube video you were watching. By
this time, all roads lead to Bing chat for Edge users, and everything but using
exact web addresses will initiate a chat session.

![Edge Browser With Bing Logo And Sidebar](/assets/images/edge-browser-with-bing-logo-and-sidebar.JPG)

Mistyped web address in the address bar initiate chat sessions because that
counts as a search. This is now the default experience on Windows with the
included browser. You have to actively work to turn it off or download an
alternative browser like Chrome to avoid this behavior.

This is significant because as operating systems and laptops get upgraded, all
defaults reset back to Bing, setting the stage for a battle that Microsoft
could win through attrition alone. At some point, the default search engine is
given a chance by users tired of going through the rigmarole of customization
and discover that Bing is actually pretty good.

While this heavy handed approach would appear to be inevitably effective,
according to Bing itself:

> There are several websites that track browser market share. According to
> **W3Counter**, Chrome accounts for 63 percent of the total market share for
> all browsers worldwide¹. According to **Global Stats StatCounter**, as of
> November 2020 Chrome holds a whopping 70.33 percent of the desktop browser
> market share worldwide³. More precisely, Chrome dominates the global web
> browser market with a whopping 65.68% share. The only other browser on the
> market that has a somewhat considerable share is Safari, with 18.68%².

Consequently, all of Microsoft's effort to make Bing the default search engine
on desktop is blocked by Google's past success in convincing people to download
Chrome. But we know Edge is based on Chrome, so does Edge show up as Chrome in
these statistics? Again, according to Bing:

> No, Edge users are not reported as Chrome users in these statistics. According
> to **Kinsta**, Microsoft Edge has a desktop browser market share of 5.83%¹.
> According to **WPOven Blog**, Microsoft’s Edge is at the second position with
> 7.75% browser market share³. According to **WebTribunal**, Microsoft Edge has a
> desktop browser market share of 10.07%⁴.

...leaving us to conclude, after calculating out Apple, that only about 1 in 8,
or 12.5% of desktop users ***don't*** go through the trouble of replacing the
default Windows browser with Chrome, which I speculate is still a residual
effect of the non-standard and now retired Internet Explorer. Aggressive
pushing of Windows 11 upgrades and new hardware will likely increase Edge
market share and drive up exposure to the Bing search + chat experience.

## Bard Availability is Announced

On March 21, 2023, Google announces that they are granting access to Bard to
people on the waiting list. Feature-wise Bard came out very sparse. No
citations. No links. No images. No ads. I received access to Bard 2 days later
and ran some rudimentary experiments on the features I felt most relevant at
the time, awareness of current events.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="Q07ADB9e84k" %}

Most notably, Google Bard stands on its own domain, bard.google.com, and is not
integrated into the main Google search experience. This is a stark difference
from Bing, which has integrated chat into the main search experience. This is a
significant because it means that Google Bard is not positioning itself as an
alternative search engine experience, nor even an enhanced one, but rather as
just a chatbot, and thus readily dismissed by the serious searcher.

As far as other features go, it can be added that Bard simultaneously offers 3
alternative responses to a prompt, but this can hardly be counted as a feature
over Bing as it closely resembles Bing's "Tone Control" feature.

## Bing Question Limit to 20

By March 27, the Bing question-limit is upped to 20, bringing us to where it
stands today. The visibly aggressive roll-out of new features slowed down, and
over the last month there has been very little new. Microsoft has been
fine-tuning under what conditions chat sessions are initiated.

![Bing Question Limit To 20](/assets/images/bing-question-limit-to-20.JPG)

## Bard Can Give Citations

As of March 28, 2023, Bard can give citations. It was not announced and may
have been there longer. It is not well integrated and only appends a few links
to the end under circumstances Bard deems appropriate. It is not clear how
Bard decides when to give citations and when not to.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="KVj93ce5XAs" %}

When citations are given, they are only ever appended at the end of the chat
response, and never embedded and hyperlinked inline with accompanying
footnote-style numbering as with Bing. Additionally, the citations are not in
the copyable text. If you actually want to "lift" the citation links and use
them in other places such as articles like this one, it can be quite a
struggle.

## Bard Being Able to Code

The last significant development in the chatbot space was Bard's ability to
provide code, announced April 21, 2023. From March 28 when limited citation
capability appeared in Bard to April 21 when coding ability was announced is
absolutely glacial in terms of the development speed we've been seeing. On the
plus side, perhaps the most exciting unannounced aspect of the coding feature
is that when you ask Bard to code something, it will actually hide under the
lower-right triple-dot menu the ability to "Export to Colab" and actually run
the code in a cloud-based Notebook environment.
