title: Secure a Home Server For AI at Home
headline: "Gain Tech Literacy: Setting Up a Home Server for AI"
description: I'm encouraging people to gain tech literacy by setting up a home server for AI. I'm offering advice on how to do this, including using Microsoft Word or Google Docs, Linux, Python, vim, git, Edge, htmx, and a lightweight JavaScript framework like Alpine. I'm also discussing Microsoft's Prometheus model and the GPT3 ChatGI, and how to set up a server to help kickstart creating content.

I like rabble on. I like to speak from the heart and follow where've the flow is leading. I like getting onto that flow-state where verklempting meta-awareness dissolves away and you're answering questions for the angels. That's kinda sorta my religion.

I think that we as human beings are highly likely to be only one expression of consciousness and self-awareness and sentience that is possible. We're the meaty social animal type splashing out of primordial oceans skittering about as conscious anti-bubbles. Even on Earth there's probably plenty of other examples of conscious that fall just shy of that meta-accelerating threshold humans got over. It could have been cats, for example.

Humans crossed over some meta-threshold that had a lot to with gaining compounding returns from external tool-use. External tools and one big internal one: language. Language is a tool. Encoding thoughts that evoke behaviors to encode thoughts is the key to trans-generational literacy, and building accomplishment upon accomplishment. Being able to encode and decide ideas is a big deal. If you're reading this article, you at least have the decoding ability.

Let's work on encoding, shall we? Microsoft Word, is it? Maybe Google Docs. They both offer big advantages. But why not just into a text file in vim? Why not into that one same text file from this moment onto the rest of your life? Thus would begin your Linux, Python, vim & git education. It's the same as building your first light saber as a Jedi. Make your 1-text-file for life file. First actually, make a folder.

Keep it in the repo folder. I set you up with a repo folder if you ran my drinkme script. And now you get into the Linux JupyterLab through your browser, I'd recommend Edge for its "save page as app" ability, at http://localhost:8888.

You need to work things trough a few times in your mind and on practice and sometimes in real implementation to get it into automatic musicale memory. You won't have that sort of excess capacity confidence until you commit a few always-needed things to heart like an actor learning their lines. What one show can you learn the lines for as a performer that would last you your entire life?

Not much. Only a few things in tech, and they're not WebDev, so they're generally not sexy. Oh let's make it WebDev too, but with htmx and a very lightweight JavaScript frameowork like Alpine. Lay out a few principles and tenants in what technologies to take up.

First, take up whatever you want. Follow your vibe. Stay liking what you're doing, but do give things that are initially unappealing a bit more chance than you're normally inclined to. You might be surprised. White space mattering in Python, I'm talking to you. Same with quacks like a duck dynamic typing. That's what's driving the popularity of the Rust programming language right now. It's even great for Python users who what to optimize some code tapping the Python C APIs, but hitting Rust instead.

I could just drone on forever. And no AI here. Only an admittedly much worse writer. But less predictable maybe? It's time to get to business. We need a repo folder we make through JuputerLab. If we get that far, we only need do a bit of code and Linux… check! Python… check! Git by the end of the project. We'll see about vim.

Okay what I want to do is inspire a sort of confidence and clarity of vision given the flurry of existential-crisis-inducing AI news of late. I have to clarify the vision for myself. There is a platform LPvg. While it is not the only such platform, it is a fine 80/20-rule safety net to general generic tech literacy. There's always more to the story, but this is the one I am telling.

Microsoft's making a brilliant move. One can only wait with baited breadth knowing that the New Bing Prometheus model is supposed to be even that much beyond GPT3 we're getting to know through ChatGPT. And it sounds like they won't mind us using it to help kickstart ourselves making some content. Hmmm, wow oh what dependencies we weave fleecing herd with no reprieve.

You need a server, my friend. It'd needs to be running on your behalf, 24x7, preferably free from cloud dependencies. We're going to start it out as the second daemon we set running on the drinkme Pipulate server. Mayvbe I should document that on the install.bat file, hoe it builds a Pipulate server. Start spreading the FOSS SEO software message right there.
