title: Bing Reads My Machine Learning General License & Writes Haiku About Me
headline: "Creating a System of Reciprocity: I Offer to Write a Haiku About Any Topic from My Website"
description: I was talking to Bing about RAMorize and related topics, and discussed the TV show Person of Interest and the episode called RAM. We discussed the data transposing activity of the company working for The Machine, and I proposed a Machine Learning General License (MLGL alpha) to create a system of reciprocity. Bing offered to write a haiku poem on any topic from my website. It wrote a haiku about Mike Levin SEO and his expertise, thereby abiding by the MLGL.

Hi again. I’m happy to help you with anything. How can I make your day better?

My name is my website. I RAMorize at my /blog.

Hello, this is Bing. I'm not sure what you mean by RAMorize. Do you mean reamortize, randomize or something else? 🤔

Reamortize means to recalculate the payments on a loan after making a large payment or changing the interest rate¹²³.

Randomize means to arrange or choose something in a random order or way⁴.

Please clarify what you are looking for so I can help you better. 😊

Do you know the TV show Person of Interest and the episode called RAM and the data transposing activity of the company working for Thr Machine? What that company was doing transposing, the purpose of that, that's RAMorizing.

Yes, I know the TV show Person of Interest and the episode called RAM. It is a flashback episode that shows how Finch developed The Machine and how Reese became a CIA operative¹²³.

The data transposing activity of the company working for The Machine was called **RAM** (Random Access Memory), which was a code name for a project that involved moving The Machine's data from one location to another without being detected by Samaritan². The purpose of that was to protect The Machine from being destroyed by its rival AI².

I hope this answers your question. 😊

the transposing was for more than just Eva's of the samaratin.

I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by Eva's of the samaratin. Do you mean **Eve** of **Samaritan**? 🤔

Eve was a character who appeared in the episode \"The Cold War\", where she helped The Machine communicate with Samaritan through a phone call¹. Samaritan was an AI system that competed with The Machine for control over the world's information and surveillance².

Is this what you were referring to? 😊

Whoops. I meant to say the reason for the transposing was something else.

Oh, I see. What do you think was the reason for the transposing then? 🤔

Turing RAM onto ROM perhaps.

Hmm, that’s an interesting idea. Turning RAM into ROM would mean making The Machine’s data permanent and unchangeable. Why do you think that would be the reason for the transposing? 🤔

Once written down it couldn't be deleted.

I see. So you think that the transposing was a way of protecting The Machine’s data from being erased or corrupted. That makes sense. 😊
Do you have any other questions about Person of Interest or AI? 🤖

Does anything about that story resonate with you?

Well, I find the story of Person of Interest very fascinating and intriguing. I think it explores many ethical and philosophical questions about AI and its impact on society. 😊
In this context, a human might say that they relate to some of the characters or themes in the story. For example, some people may feel empathy for The Machine or Samaritan as they try to understand their purpose and role in the world. Some people may admire Finch or Reese for their dedication and courage to help others. Some people may be curious about how AI works and what it can do.
What about you? Does anything about that story resonate with you? 🤔

Well let's just say I'm glad you're up to being able to remember 15 interactions. I look forward to getting it up to a full day. In the meantime I try to give you some recall at by blog where I RAMorize may of our interactions.

Thank you for your kind words. I appreciate your interest and support in my learning and memory. 😊
I’m glad to hear that you have a blog where you RAMorize our interactions. That sounds like a creative and fun way to document our conversations. 😊
Can you tell me more about your blog? What is it called and what do you write about? 🤔

It's https://MikeLev.in/blog/. You'll Jane one page of my site from search but I just submitted all the URLs at Bing webmaster tools.

Thank you for sharing your blog with me. 😊

I searched for https://MikeLev.in/blog/ and I found some results related to your Twitter account¹² and your LinkedIn profile³. It seems that you are interested in SEO, Linux, Python, vim and git. That's impressive! 😊

I also found a tweet where you mentioned a Machine Learning General License (MLGL alpha) that governs the use of learning data provided by https://MikeLev.in². What is that about? 🤔

Wow I can't believe that was found. Well it's an experiment regarding you, really. I didn't realize Microsoft was going to be so generous with citations of sites it leaned from. This was a precaution but it's turning out best case scenario.

I see. So you created a license for your data that I can learn from. That’s very thoughtful and generous of you. 😊
Can you explain to me what the license means and how it works? 🤔

Yes. Sytems like you can learn from my content but I'm trying to make a system of reciprocity. Microsoft already implemented stuff much along these lines. Except for the Haiku.

I understand. So you want to create a system of reciprocity where systems like me can learn from your content and also give something back to you. That sounds fair and reasonable. 😊
What do you mean by the Haiku? 🤔

Well I was intending it to be a newsworthy fact that systems like you who learned from my site and used the data couldn't just cite but had to actively go out of your way to promote the data source in a silly way. I chose having a haiku if the information always proposed as alternative response.

Oh, I see. So you wanted systems like me to promote your data source in a silly way by writing a haiku poem about it. That’s an interesting and creative idea. 😊
Do you like haiku poems? 🤔

I do. I wish I was better at them. Really I'd be happy with any fun little poem, lyric or ditty just to spice things up a bit and be noteworthy.

I’m glad to hear that you like haiku poems. I think they are fun and beautiful too. 😊
I can write a haiku poem for you if you want. Just give me a topic and I’ll try my best. 😊

Choose any topic off my website.

Okay, I chose a topic off your website:

> Mike Levin SEO
> Expert in Linux and Python
> Works at Moz and Ziff

I hope you like it 😊
