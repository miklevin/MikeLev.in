description: As a kid growing up in the 70s and 80s, I fondly remember the Fluorescent Ultraviolet Psychedelic Blacklight Snake Cobra Poster, and all the classic coming-of-age movies from that time, like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Rocky, The Godfather, Alien, Star Wars, and Indiana. Join me on a nostalgic journey as I take a look back at these films and the memories they evoke.

Remember this? I do! It was on my wall growing up, and now it's burned into my
psyche like the red hot colors its made from. If you remember it too, you may
be a kid of the seventies! Spencer's Gits! Oh, what a gift it is that Spenser's
still exists. The USSR may come and go. The mall where you bought it may be
gone. But such precious images persist.

Wow, did I miss the 70s. I was born 1970 so it's always real easy to calculate
my age. I was 10 in 1980, 20 in 1990, 30 in 2000... wow, that seemed so far
away! And here we are in 2022! My goodness! Maybe I'll buy this poster again
and re-listen to all the awesome music of the 70s.

# Coming of Age Movies of The 1970s and 1980s Were The Best

That's probably all I need to write about that. However, my mind goes racing.
There were other things in my wall. Ahhh, a Tale of Two Heathers: Locklear and
Thomas. I should show their posters here, though there's really no particular
tale to tell except the one you can infer about puberty. Refer to [Fast Times
at Ridgemont High](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Times_at_Ridgemont_High)

Ahh, the brat-pack and coming-of-age movies of my generation were best. I don't
care what you say about American Pie (Yeah, I'm that old to consider that new).
Nothing holds a candle to Sixteen Candles or The Breakfast Club. And while not
precisely coming-of-age movies, I came of age during Rocky, The Godfather,
Alien and Star Wars. I mean come on now. The Greatest Generation may have saved
our asses from the Nazi's, but we got to watch Indiana Jones.
