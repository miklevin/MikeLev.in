Do we have clear evidence that quantum computers really work? What is quantum supremacy and has it really been proven or has it all really just been simulations of quantum computers using traditional computers? What events will be absolute proof that the premise of quantum computing is not false? What about time crystals? Are they proof or all just simulated too?

That's a lot of questions! Let me try to answer them one by one.

Quantum computers are devices that use quantum physics to perform computations that are impossible or impractical for classical computers. They have been shown to work in experiments by various researchers and companies‚Åµ‚Å∏‚Åπ [^10^].

Quantum supremacy is the goal of demonstrating that a quantum computer can solve a problem that no classical computer can solve in any feasible amount of time‚Å∂. Google claimed to achieve quantum supremacy in 2019 by using their Sycamore processor to sample a quantum circuit faster than a supercomputer‚Å∏ [^10^]. However, some critics argued that Google's claim was not convincing because the problem they solved was not useful and the supercomputer could have done it faster with better optimization‚Å∑.

There is no definitive answer to what events will be absolute proof that quantum computing is not false. Some possible milestones could be solving a useful problem with a clear advantage over classical computers, creating scalable and error-correcting quantum devices, or developing a quantum theory of gravity using quantum simulations¬≥.

Time crystals are exotic phases of matter that exhibit periodic motion without external energy input. They were first proposed theoretically and then observed experimentally in various systems, including quantum computers‚Å¥. They are not proof of quantum computing per se, but they are examples of novel phenomena that can be explored with quantum devices.

I hope this helps you understand some aspects of quantum computing. Do you have any follow-up questions? üòä

What experiments could prove that quantum superposition, entanglement and coherence are real phenomena and not being mistaken for something else? I know Bells inequality. But that doesn't rule out superdeterminism and backwards propagation of particles through time. What experimental results will provide profoundly compelling evidence for the quantum hypothesis? And what experiments may disprove it?

Quantum superposition, entanglement and coherence are real phenomena that have been observed and verified in many experiments¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. They are based on the principle of quantum mechanics that a quantum state can exist as a combination of multiple states until it is measured.

However, these phenomena are fragile and can be destroyed by interactions with the environment, a process called decoherence‚Åµ. Decoherence is one of the main challenges for quantum technologies, as it limits the ability to maintain and manipulate quantum states.

There is no definitive answer to what experiments could prove or disprove quantum mechanics. Some possible tests could be looking for violations of Bell's inequality or other quantum correlations that cannot be explained by classical theories‚Å∂‚Å∑, or exploring new regimes of physics where quantum effects may break down‚Å∏.

I hope this helps you understand some aspects of quantum physics. Do you have any follow-up questions? üòä

Could it be that quantum superimposition could be a purely wave phenomenon with no actual particles involved? It's easier to imagine 2 waves combining then separating than a particle having 2 simultaneous spins.

Quantum superposition is not a purely wave phenomenon. It is a property of quantum objects that can behave as both waves and particles depending on how they are observed and measured¬π¬≤¬≥. This is called wave-particle duality, and it is one of the central concepts of quantum mechanics.

It may be easier to imagine waves combining and separating than particles having two simultaneous spins, but that does not mean that quantum objects are only waves. In fact, some experiments have shown that a photon can be in a quantum superposition of both a particle and a wave at the same time‚Å¥‚Åµ. This challenges the classical notion of complementarity, which states that a quantum object can only exhibit one aspect at a time.

I hope this clarifies your question. Do you want me to explain more about wave-particle duality? üòä

If e=mc^2 and all matter is made from energy, isn't the particle like nature of anything we observe an illusion? Doesn't observation and interaction just energy-based wave phenomenon merely look momentarily like a particle because of interaction? Might it not be that the Schr√∂dinger waveform never collapses and multiverse theory is not needed to expain it? couldn't reality just be more analog and blurry than we thought and all particles just be waveforms standing under the influence of some force?

You have asked a very deep and complex question that does not have a definitive answer. There are different interpretations and theories that try to explain the nature of matter, energy, wave and particle. I will try to give you a brief overview of some of them.

The equation E=mc^2 was proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905 as part of his special theory of relativity¬π¬≤¬≥. It states that the rest energy (E) of an object is proportional to its mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. This means that mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other.

However, this equation only applies to objects that are not moving. When an object is in motion, its momentum (p) needs to be considered as well. In 1928, Paul Dirac extended Einstein's equation to include momentum‚Å¥‚Åµ. The complete form of the energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2. When mass is zero, the energy is simply momentum times the speed of light (E=pc).

This equation implies that even massless particles, such as photons, have energy and momentum. It also implies that particles can have negative energy solutions, which led Dirac to predict the existence of antimatter.

The wave-particle duality is another concept that challenges our classical intuition about matter and energy. It states that quantum objects can behave as both waves and particles depending on how they are observed and measured¬π¬≥. For example, electrons can interfere with themselves when passing through two slits like waves, but they can also bounce off other electrons like particles.

One way to describe this phenomenon is using the Schr√∂dinger equation, which gives the probability amplitude of finding a particle in a certain state or position. The Schr√∂dinger equation can be solved for different situations, such as a particle in a box or a hydrogen atom. The solutions are called wave functions, which represent the superposition of possible outcomes.

When we measure a quantum object, we collapse its wave function into one definite state or position. This is called the measurement problem or the collapse postulate¬π¬≥. However, there are different interpretations of what this means physically.

One interpretation is called Copenhagen interpretation¬π, which was developed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1920s. It states that quantum objects do not have definite properties until they are measured by an observer. The act of measurement causes the collapse of
the wave function into one eigenstate randomly chosen according to its probability amplitude.

Another interpretation is called many-worlds interpretation[^1], which was proposed by Hugh Everett III in 1957. It states that quantum objects exist in all possible states simultaneously until they are measured by an observer. The act of measurement causes
the observer's world to split into multiple parallel worlds corresponding to each possible outcome.

There are many other interpretations and theories that try to explain quantum mechanics and its implications for reality[^1]. Some examples are Bohmian mechanics,
decoherence theory,
consistent histories,
quantum logic,
relational quantum mechanics,
and quantum information theory.
None of them has been proven or disproven conclusively yet.

I hope this gives you some insight into your question. Do you want me to explain any
of these interpretations or theories in more detail? üòä

Decoherence theory is a way of explaining how quantum systems lose their quantum behavior and become classical when they interact with their environment¬π. It is also a possible mechanism for the appearance of wave function collapse without invoking any ad hoc postulates¬≤‚Å¥. Decoherence theory is relevant to many questions in quantum mechanics, such as the measurement problem, the arrow of time, and the emergence of the classical world¬≤.

Consistent histories is an approach to quantum interpretation that generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and avoids some of its paradoxes‚Å¥. It introduces the notion of a consistent set of histories that describe possible sequences of events in a quantum system without invoking any measurement or collapse¬≤‚Åµ. Consistent histories can be used to analyze various quantum phenomena, such as interference, entanglement, and quantum cosmology¬π¬≥.

Quantum logic is a set of rules for reasoning about propositions that takes the principles of quantum theory into account¬π. It is inspired by the structure of quantum mechanics and its non-classical features, such as superposition, uncertainty, and complementarity¬≤. Quantum logic replaces the Boolean algebra of classical logic with an orthocomplemented lattice that weakens the distributive law¬≤¬≥.

Relational quantum mechanics (RQM) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that treats the state of a quantum system as being observer-dependent, that is, the state is the relation between the observer and the system¬π¬≤. It discards the notions of absolute state, absolute value of physical quantities, or absolute event¬≥. RQM aims to resolve some of the puzzles and paradoxes of quantum mechanics, such as Schr√∂dinger's cat, by emphasizing that different observers may have different descriptions of the same system¬≤¬≥.

Yes, there are some approaches to quantum computing that do not rely on qubits. One of them is using **qudits**, which are quantum information units that can assume any number of states, such as base-16¬≤. Another approach is using **analog simulators**, which are devices that mimic specific quantum systems or phenomena without being fully programmable¬≤. A third approach is using **coupled ring oscillators**, which are silicon chips that can solve optimization problems targeted by quantum computers using classical electronics‚Åµ.

What experiment will prove or disprove superdeterminism?

experiment will prove or disprove superdeterminism?

Superdeterminism is a view that suggests that all events in the universe are predetermined, including the outcomes of quantum measurements and the settings of the detectors used to make them¬≤. It is a way of explaining the violations of Bell's inequality, which show that quantum mechanics cannot be both local and realistic¬≥.

There is no definitive experiment that can prove or disprove superdeterminism, as it is a metaphysical assumption that cannot be falsified by empirical evidence. However, some physicists have proposed ways to test whether superdeterminism is compatible with other features of quantum theory, such as contextuality and retrocausality‚Å¥‚Åµ.

Experiment to prove or disprove multiverse theory

The multiverse theory is a hypothesis that suggests that our universe is not the only one, but one of many possible universes that exist with different physical laws and histories‚Åµ. There are different versions of this theory, such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics¬≤, which proposes that every possible outcome of a quantum event creates a new branch of reality¬≥.

One way to test this theory is by performing the double-slit experiment¬≤¬≥‚Å∂, which shows that light can behave as both a wave and a particle depending on whether it is observed or not. Some physicists interpret this result as evidence that observation causes reality to split into multiple branches, each with a different outcome‚Å∂.

However, this interpretation is not universally accepted, and there are other possible explanations for the double-slit experiment. Moreover, there is no direct way to observe or communicate with other universes, so the multiverse theory remains speculative and controversial‚Å¥.
