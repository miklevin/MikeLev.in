title: Addictive & Self-Reinforcing Double-Helix Pair of Motivating Projects
headline: Exploring Data with a Double-Helix of Motivating Projects
description: I'm starting two exciting projects that will motivate and energize each other. The first is creating a comprehensive slide deck about our data and how it compares to competitors, in a storytelling format. The second is to Moz-itize my work, easing people into this approach and starting each project with a kernel. Come join me on this journey and learn how to make the most of your data!

I need 2 projects now that motivate me and cross-pollinate, feeding off of each
others energy and get me excited to get and keep working on them.

The first will go with the first real Moz work that I was assigned to, and that
will be a slide deck. I should do a comprehensive overview of what data we have
and how it's accessible and usable in different ways, along with comparing it
to competitors to the best of my (our) ability.

I tried to do this in a very fill-in-the-cell grid approach, which at first
feels like a great way to go about this, imposes too much structure. It feels
like if you can't fill in the box, you shouldn't and it makes it feel
incomplete. I think a Powerpoint-style deck is a better starting point. Tell a
story and flesh it out. Transpose what you discover back into grid.

The second project will be basically what I do on my own anyway, but I'll
Moz-itize it. There's so many deliverable-types that you can generate with
Python in Jupyter and then 24x7 automate (if appropriate) that... well, the
sky's the limit. I just have to ease people into this approach. It feels like
there are technical hurdles.

Between throwing out my back and all the GPT ChatBot news of late, it's almost
like I started at Moz twice. This is me sinking my teeth in now. Start each
project as just that initial kernel. Then start building on each. And the
nature of that kernel is important. You know enough to do it well now.
