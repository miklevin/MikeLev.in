title: Center, A Poem
headline: "Staying Centered: Finding Balance Through Poetry and Inline Styling"
description: As a poet, I often feel off-center. I use my poetry to stay centered, but when I publish it, I'm too far left. To stay centered, I need to create a style definition that sets margin to auto and width to a percentage of the containing element, and put my styles inline. Even though the world is not perfect, I need to stay centered and put my styles inline to make sure my message is heard.

> I write poetry<br />
> And am often off-center<br />
> There's some question of cause-and-effect.<br />
> I like to think my poetry helps keep me centered.<br />
> But when I publish it, I'm way too far left.<br />
> It turns out, you must first create a division.<br />
> If you want to keep centered, you need a centering divide.<br />
> Divide and center? Is that it? Is this a necessary step?<br />
> Sigh... yes, Charlie Brown. You must first divide.<br />
> Okay, okay, so I have a div. What next?<br />
> Find a place to put a style, in head or inline. I chose head.<br />
> Give your div some class. The class I chose is poem<br />
> Create a style definition for that class that sets margin to auto.<br />
> It also must set width to a percentage of containing element.<br />
> I am wrong. It should be inline. That way, there's no dissociating.<br />
> Stay centered, my friend.<br />
> The world is not perfect.<br />
> Put your styles inline if that's what you need<br />
> To get centered right now... when you need it.<br />
> Thank you.<br />
