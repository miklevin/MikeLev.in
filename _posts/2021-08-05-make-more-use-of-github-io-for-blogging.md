Welcome to MikeLevinSEO.com. My name is my blog. And the best place to start is
at the beginning. So here we go.

I've wanted to publish a book my whole life. But for whatever reasons, I never
have. Yet publishing has become easier than ever. So now there's almost
legitimately no reason that if I REALLY DO want to publish, rather than just
saying that, I should be ashamed of myself for not doing so, at least a more
regular blog without the years-at-a-time time-outs. So this is it. Tackle each
issue and make it the subject of the book itself.

It's always too meta with me. Meta just means being self-referential. In my
industry, meta tags are invisible information about the page that could work as
instructions to browsers or search engines like Google. However, meta also
refers to that strange quality of human consciousness that lets us say I think
therefore I am. The best laid plans are laid waste by allowing your mind to go
meta about a thing too soon. There I go again. Shoot, gotta get over that every
time I start out trying to tap my creative abilities. There is no surer way to
self-sabotage more than to think too much about what you're doing. Just keep
writing and let it flow.

1, 2, 3... 1? That is my forever-motto. I always seem to be on step #1. But
hey, if you're making up the rules as you go, why not? Oh yeah, I am always
making up the rules as I go, because I rarely if ever fall into a static state.
Actually, I do all the time and I'm projecting terribly by saying that I don't.
My objective in life and career is actually to avoid falling into a static
state, ever. However, I know that I do. Heard of the funk? Yup, the daily
grind, the routine, call it what you will. While it is safe and eases the
scared animal within us all that hates the uncertainty and tomorrow, it is also
the soul-crusher and the source of much unhappiness and early death.

Step 1 in this case is actually getting this first bit of typing published.
You'd think that the publishing platforms and tools would have come first. I
own a WordPress instance on a cheap Web host and could totally push this out
there. But that site is one of the things that's wrong right now and will be
the subject of a WordPress to plain-text (markdown) migration. I don't want a
WordPress instance in my life. I don't want the hosting issues. I don't want
the cost. And I don't even want the general tech-liability. It's a moving-parts
thing. Simplicity is generally best. Even if things are complex under the hood,
as they probably are in the method I'm moving to, I don't ever have to see or
think about them.

After I export my old blog as markdown files, which are really just text-files
with bare minimum formatting instructions, I'll be dropping them onto Github
where the github.io system will automatically formats them into pretty HTML
with a tool called Jekyll that's built into Github. Really there's probably a
lot of complexity going on here. But from my perspective, I'm just going to be
pushing a bunch of text-files onto Github with a git push. More on git later.
Suffice to say for now, I actually write nearly every day. Writing is not the
problem for me. It's getting it out there, and I'm piggybacking on all the
other tools I use for day-to-day work, the way I earn my living, in order to
push the files out there without too much tech-liability or overhead added to
my life. And this is good.

I've already got one site published on github.io currently. All I've got to do
is to see how to make a second registered domain (apex domain) resolve (be
hosted) there. So I'm going to go look at my portfolio of domains. That brings
up the issue that I'll be switching all my registered domains from GoDaddy over
to NameCheap, but that'll be another story. I need a strategy for this book
publishing, and it's going to be following:

- What's good for my soul
- Where my thinking/writing leads me
- Whatever that tells me is next in 1, 2, 3... 1?
- Whatever is best aligned to my job/career/livelihood

I'm already running out of time in this writing session. And so I need to do a
quick 80/20-rule evaluation:

- Where do I get the biggest bang for the buck?
- What's most broken?
- What plates need spinning?

That's 3 metaphors. They're my 3 daily metaphors of organizing my work, and
eventually getting through everything. I need to figure out how to host a 2nd
domain name on github.io. So, pick a domain... GoDaddy / My Name / My Products
/ Domains.  Okay, in my typical tradition it's going to be mikelevinseo.com. So
click "Use My Domain" and then DNS / Manage Zones.
