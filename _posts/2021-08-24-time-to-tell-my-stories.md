Hello World. It's Mike Levin, SEO in New York City. Technically now I'm now
really Mike Levin, the Poconos Pythonista since quarantine and lockdown hit, I
got my ass out of Dodge, such as it were, back to a sort of "home" I've known
growing up, the nearby tiny mountains of Pennsylvania. It's right near the
Delaware Water Gap which is lots of beautiful State park.

I'm one of the blessed able to telecommute for whom lockdown turned out to be
more of a boon than a bust. I feel bad for how many lives were lost and I know
herd immunity is both truth and tragedy. But humanity was through it before and
we'll be through it again.  The best we can do is to be prepared without being
paranoid, and for a long time I new that being at Ground Zero was not the
wisest move for either me or my family. But my child is inextricably bound to
the suburbia of New York City known as Staten Island, and as long as she is I
have to stay close enough for weekly pickup and drop-off. Okay, so where does
that leave me?

Oh yes! I have stories. I have lots and lots of stories, and I need to tell my
stories. I will be using all sorts of information tricks and principles from my
career of search engine optimization to ensure that my stories last forever
(insofar as I can).

Every time I write, I should endeavor to have the content "land" in the correct
sorting bin, such as it were. I really hate having different places for things
because it increases the mental overhead of organizing and sorting content. And
the worst is registering yet another domain, but I just did that anyway:

linuxpythonvimgit.com

It's really long overdue given my schtick. Try to get into the groove of "never
not be publishing" (on one of these sites):
