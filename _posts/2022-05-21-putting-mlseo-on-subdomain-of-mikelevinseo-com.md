Projects, pshaw! It's the little things that make all the difference. Screw
projects. I have to get MLSEO underway better. And so...

Go to my registrar and make 4 A-Records pointing mlseo for MikeLevinSEO.com to
mlseo.mikelevinseo.com... done!

Okay, now go to:

    Go to Github / mlseo / Settings / Pages

...and add mlseo.mikelevinseo.com as the custom domain... done!

Check https://mlseo.mikelevin.seo to see if it's there. It is. Woot! It even is
using the right template. I'm just waiting for the security certificate to be
issued.

I love it when things go this easily... things... not projects. THAT'S WHY they
go so easily, LOL!

And then looking around becomes your new checklist. Rinse and repeat.
