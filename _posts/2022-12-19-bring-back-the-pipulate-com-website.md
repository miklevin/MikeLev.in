There are tools that are external to your body, and there are tools that are
internal to your body, and the difference is in a combination of:

- licensing
- feature churn

It's a strange thing, but a big argument for not using proprietary software is
that it remains external to your body. You can not incorporate it into your
digital DNA and pass it on as a hereditary trait. You can with FOSS software,
because licensing allows it. And if feature-churn is low, the mechanical skills
of using the tools are hereditary as well, because muscle memory is a sort of a
cache or lookup-table. Feature-churn breaks such lookup tables, because all the
mappings change. People who learn the roads around where they grew up and then
move to a new town know what I'm talking about with this mapping. FOSS software
should be like the town you grew up in whose mappings remain forever useful
because you carry the town around with you inside.

Okay, let's nuke the pipulate.com site and put a new one in location.

I want Pipulate to be handled like MikeLev.in/index.md

Okay, I've wiped the gh-pages branch of pipulate and have the new in my set of
files that I'm always editing all the time.

Okay, so I've been talking about FOSS SEO software for awhile now, and all the
elements have finally come together in a way that I can bottle. It's all the
stuff I've been talking about for years, but now able to be magically
incantationed into existence.

Python is the ultimate tool for SEO. All the things you can do in Python are
amazing, but ultimately you are just expressing yourself. If you lack the words
to execute on a technical project that you have in your head and can express in
great detail verbally
