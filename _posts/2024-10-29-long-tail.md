The mouse's long tail starts here, but let me warn you, you have never heard
anything so dry. It starts, as many such ripples through time and space do, with
a mathemetician. For our story, ours is named Fernando J. Corbató, and he was
frustrated that elite snobs wouldn't give him enough computer time. So he
expressed&#151;maybe not for the first time in reality but certainly for the
first time that ever reallly truely deeply mattered to our day-to-day
lives&#151;how to share it.
