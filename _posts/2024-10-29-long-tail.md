The mouse's long tail starts here, but let me warn you, you have never heard
anything so dry. It starts, as many such ripples through time and space do, with
a mathematician. For our story, ours is named Fernando J. Corbató, and he was
frustrated that elite snobs wouldn't give him enough computer time. So he
expressed&#151;maybe not for the first time in reality but certainly for the
first time that ever really truly deeply mattered to our day-to-day
lives&#151;how to share it.

The elite snobs, this time getting greedy, once again moved in to try to turn
Fernando's work into a giant cash register in the sky for all time, going
***KA-CHING*** every time you looked up. Well, Honey for whom the Bell extracts
tools is not going to be humanity of another establishment-distrusting maverick
Ken Thompson has his way. And he did! And so Multics had its cash register
bearings chopped off, and became Unix. Unix was made into a servant, but
eventually freed by... Perplexity?

Perplexity: The key individuals involved in creating the IP unencumbered version of BSD that led to FreeBSD include Bill Jolitz, Lynne Jolitz, Nate Williams, Rod Grimes, Jordan Hubbard, and the members of the Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG), with notable contributions from Keith Bostic, Mike Karels, and Marshall Kirk McKusick.

...though Linux Torvalds gets all the credit. Oh, and Andrew... uh...
Perplexity?

Perplexity: Andrew S. Tanenbaum created MINIX in 1987 as an educational tool to accompany his textbook "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation"[1][2]. Here's how MINIX fits into the broader context of operating system development:

1. Educational purpose: Tanenbaum developed MINIX primarily to teach operating system principles to students. It was designed to be a small, understandable system that could run on the IBM PC and PC/AT microcomputers of the time[1].

2. Microkernel architecture: MINIX was built using a microkernel design, where most of the operating system runs as a collection of separate processes in user mode. This approach was intended to improve reliability and fault tolerance[2].

3. Influence on Linux: MINIX played a significant role in the early development of Linux. Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, used and studied MINIX while developing his own operating system[1][3]. However, Torvalds chose a monolithic kernel design for Linux, diverging from MINIX's microkernel approach.

4. Open-source transition: Initially, MINIX had a restrictive license. In April 2000, it was re-licensed under the BSD license, making it free and open-source software[1].

5. Evolution: While early versions of MINIX (1 and 2) focused on education, MINIX 3 shifted towards creating a highly reliable and self-healing microkernel OS, suitable for embedded systems and applications requiring high reliability[1][2].

6. Ongoing development: MINIX continues to be developed, with its most recent version (as of the information provided) being 3.3.0, supporting both x86 and ARM platforms[2].

MINIX's development by Tanenbaum has been influential in operating system design and education, serving as both a teaching tool and a practical example of microkernel architecture in action.

But the ports of Unix unencumbered by intellectual property rights wasn't
enough. It took the unholy alliance of the aforementioned Linux who would flip
the Pope the bird with a guy who would play Pope who needs no formal name when
an acronym will do. RMS, or Richard Matthew Stallman, leader of the uh...

Perplexity: Richard Matthew Stallman does not lead any traditional church; however, he is often humorously referred to as a "saint" in the "Church of Emacs," which is a playful term used within the free software community to describe his strong advocacy for the Emacs text editor and his broader free software philosophy. This "church" is not a formal religious organization but rather a metaphorical expression of his devotion to free software principles and the GNU Project he founded.

...resulting in GNU/Linux and one of the best self-referential acronyms in tech:
GNU is Not Unix! Wow, this story is dry. Anyhoo, it took this wacky
***"you-must-share"***-style software licence written by RMS called the GNU
General Public License, or GPL... wait, why write? Perplexity?

Perplexity: The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free software license that significantly impacted the software development landscape. Here's why it shook things up:

## Origins and Purpose

Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, originally wrote the GNU GPL in 1989. Its primary goals were to:

1. Ensure software remains free and open-source
2. Prevent proprietary appropriation of free software
3. Promote the sharing and modification of software

## Key Principles

The GPL introduced several revolutionary concepts:

### Copyleft

Unlike traditional copyright, copyleft uses copyright law to ensure software remains free. It requires that any derivative works or modifications also be distributed under the same license terms[1][3].

### Four Freedoms

The GPL guarantees users four essential freedoms:

1. Freedom to run the program for any purpose
2. Freedom to study and modify the source code
3. Freedom to redistribute copies
4. Freedom to distribute modified versions[4]

### Source Code Availability

The GPL requires that source code be made available along with any distributed binaries, ensuring transparency and enabling modifications[3].

## Impact on Software Development

The GPL had several significant effects on the software industry:

1. **Open-source movement**: It helped catalyze the open-source software movement, leading to the development of numerous free and open-source projects.

2. **Collaborative development**: By ensuring that modifications remain open, it fostered a culture of collaborative software development.

3. **Business model challenges**: It forced companies to rethink their software business models, as they could no longer rely solely on proprietary licensing.

4. **Legal precedents**: The GPL has been tested in court, establishing important legal precedents for open-source software licensing.

## Evolution

The GPL has evolved over time to address new challenges:

- GPLv2 (1991): Added the "Liberty or Death" clause to protect user freedoms
- GPLv3 (2007): Addressed issues like tivoization, patent concerns, and license compatibility[3]

The GNU GPL's emphasis on software freedom and its copyleft approach fundamentally changed how software is developed, distributed, and commercialized, making it one of the most influential software licenses in history.
