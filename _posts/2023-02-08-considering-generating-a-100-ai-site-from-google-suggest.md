title: Considering Generating a 100% AI Site From Google Suggest
headline: "Creating a 100% AI Website: Join me on this Journey!"
description: I'm embarking on a public project to create a 100% AI-generated website using free tools and no particular topics in mind. To do this, I've set up a hosted site on Github Pages, added Google Analytics Measurement ID, and filled in some basic content suggested by Google Suggest and ChatGPT. I'm looking for readers to join me on this journey and help me come up with new ideas to complete this project.

Let's create a site that's 100% AI-generated just for the experience. I'm going
to use 100% free tools and perhaps even have a little manual involvement at
first. Let's assume I'm not even coming with particular topics in mind. Let's
let online tools guide us. How do we even start? Well, we need a hosted site.
For that I'll use Github Pages. It uses the Jekyll static site generator. I'll
throw the domain guerillatech.com to the cause.

Okay, let's use the markdown and css from Pipulate.com. That's pretty
stripped-down and a good starting point. Alright, the template files are in
place but not really even a template yet. Go strip them down to bare minimum
fast.

Okay, set it's Google Analytics code. It's called a Measurement ID now. Strip
out the old site logo. Okay, filled in some basic content suggested by Google
Suggest and some content created by ChatGPT, but I'm about running out of steam
for today. Think about carrying out a public project that uses Google Suggest
and keyword clustering to identify the topics, then ChatGPT to write the
on-page content, and some sort of scraping tool to come up with what successful
competitors are doing on the same keywords.

This project may stall out depending on how the next week or so goes. I've got
a number of possible discretionary projects to take on and they've got to be
the best ones to set me up for my next professional opportunity. Generating
content out of ChatGPT and things like it are what anyone can do. Focus on
stuff that has a slightly higher barrier to entry and which is still of great
public interest. Choose one of them and take it to best-in-the-world status.
