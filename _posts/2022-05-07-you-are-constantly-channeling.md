title: You Are Constantly Channeling
headline: "Unlocking the Secrets of Consciousness: Exploring the New Normal"
description: I'm constantly channeling, but I don't always recognize it. My sensitivity levels have been lowered for my own peace of mind, but that doesn't mean I'm not still receiving messages. In this blog post, I'm capturing a droplet of that messaging and sharing it with you, so you can understand how consciousness works and why it's important to pay attention to these signals. Come explore this new normal with me.

You are channeling constantly. You just don't know it because of sensitivity
levels that have been dialed down for the sake of sanity. "New normal" has
taken on a bad connotation, as if something were being given up or lost. That's
stupid. New normals is what we do. Got an itch? Need to scratch it? Probably
now that I mentioned it yeah, sure. But before that? Did you know that itchy
feeling was there? No, probably not. Our nerves are always being stimulated in
such a way.

Blood's coursing through our blood vessels. Feel it? No? That's because our
nerves are mostly put on the outside, thank goodness. But it's not such a clear
line. Sensitivity comes in from many places throughout our bodies, and not all
of it is easily understoold or measured. We still don't really know what gives
rise to conciousness that can ponder it all.

We don't know shit, but something from somewhere is trying to tell us a thing
or two, probably terribly frustrated that its tsunami of messaging is only
being tuned-in as the lightest trickle of itch. If we're lucky, we can capture
a droplet and push it out as a blog post like this one.
