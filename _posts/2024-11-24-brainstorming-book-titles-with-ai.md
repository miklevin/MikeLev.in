One of the side-effects of vim in your life is writing like breathing. Imagine
all that cognitive overhead of which writing environment to write in just fading
away. No Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word vs. whatever claiming today to let you
maintain flow state. No Obsidian versus Notion versus SimpleNotes vs. Notes.

You can still use whatever you like, wherever you life, however you like. This
is not religion. This is a baseline net. First you learn to breath when the
doctor smacks you or whatever, then there's holding your head up, crawling,
walking, talking and all that being a higher order primate stuff. I mean sure,
vertebrate first, then some sort of mammal, then the upright walking talking
chattering nattering kind. Somewhere in there, an abstract thinker and toolmaker
and user that can transmit information over the generations with a sort of
compounding effect so the reset button isn't pressed on you and your kind quite
so much. A slowing down of interruptions.

And so now, you can also write. It's the main trick of that trans-generational
passdown thing. Sure, wealth. But that's gonna spoil ya in a generation or two,
and without all the right lawyers and trust funds and a lot of institutional
stuff to hold you up, you go down in a few generations. That expression about
building on boots and sliding on slippers...

**Perplexity**: The expression you're referring to is likely a variation of a quote attributed to Voltaire: "History is filled with the sound of silken slippers going downstairs and wooden shoes coming up." This phrase metaphorically contrasts the gentle, quiet descent of those in comfort or power (symbolized by "silken slippers") with the louder, more forceful ascent of those who are striving for upward mobility (represented by "wooden shoes")[5][8].

Another related quote is: "History is only the pattern of silken slippers descending the stairs to the thunder of hobnailed boots climbing upward from below," which emphasizes the same theme of social mobility and the dynamics between different classes[8]. 

These expressions highlight the idea that while some enjoy a comfortable and secure status (the "slippers"), there are others who are actively working hard and struggling to rise (the "boots"). This metaphor serves as a commentary on socioeconomic disparities and the often unseen efforts of those striving for a better life.

**Me**: Yeah, but what I'm saying is that the trust fund babies lose their edge. They're insulated from the stuff of life that fired and tempered us into who we are. Ya gotta face adversity and struggle a bit to find your mettle.

Perplexity: The search results don't directly address this specific quote or concept. However, the sentiment you're expressing aligns with the metaphorical quote about "silken slippers" and "wooden shoes" I mentioned earlier - which precisely captures your point about privilege potentially dulling one's resilience.

Your observation suggests that **comfort can breed complacency**, while **struggle develops character**. People who are shielded from life's challenges by wealth or privilege may:

- Lack the necessary grit and adaptability
- Miss out on formative experiences that build resilience
- Fail to develop the same hunger and drive as those who've faced genuine obstacles

The core idea is that adversity isn't just a hardship, but a **crucible that forges personal strength**. Those who must constantly navigate challenges learn problem-solving, develop mental toughness, and gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world.

This perspective echoes timeless wisdom about the value of struggle in personal development - that true character isn't inherited or purchased, but **earned through overcoming genuine difficulties**.

Had I made different moves early in life, I'd be riding high and sitting pretty
right about now. Just dropping a few grand into Google at the right time alone,
and a crime I didn't considering I'm an SEO and have been since before the days
of Google and knew exactly what it was when it was emerging. Stupidity! Same
with Bitcoin, the importance of GPUs and all that jazz. Totally understood it.
Was happy to talk about it. Based my skills around it. Just never invested
monetarily into the companies behind it.

No, I invested in myself. I learned vim. I learned text inside and out. I
learned controlling headless servers and deeply internalized the simple truth
that nearly all tech is text and all text controls tech. Yes, there's
exceptions, but name a field where data, and thus information systems and
flow-control of data processes doesn't control the overarching big picture in
one way or another. Science? Craft? Sports? Music? Business? Art? Entertainment?
There's basically no human endeavor where it doesn't come down to information,
and ultimately the way it's organized, activated in our lives, controlled,
handed down through the generations and such.

I know it all gets a bit abstract about here, but the point that's worth noting
is that the same difficult decisions that hits you when it finally comes time to
sit down and write, Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word, is the same decision that
ties into everything information in all aspects of the human experience. We are
creatures of data-manipulation techniques for survival. Technology. Tech. Text.
Text controls all things. Control text better, have secret weapons in life.

It's easy to get infatuated. There's always a shiny new object. As those higher
order primates that we are, we're drawn to the new toy. The new tool. The new
technique. We intuitively feel their game-changing nature. Any one of them could
alter the course of your life. The tribe. All human history. Fear of missing out
is strong in these ones. They have no patience! We will learn patience.

Having that patience is what you need to let yourself settle into vi/vim/nvim.
One does not just sit down and learn vim. One knocks one's head against the wall
repeatedly and allows things to frustrate you for weeks, months and yes,
sometimes even years as you learn to pick your head up... crawl... walk...
speak, and eventually comfortably switch between vim/vim/nvim, VSCode and
perhaps the truly enlightened amongst you, eVIl mode in eMacs.

I am not even advocating the best way to have what amounts to nearly telepathic
mind-to-bit control over text. No, I am only advocating good enough. All the
work you're going to put into the text-controlling muscle memory that can never
be taken away from you again by the next software company forced upgrade cycle
that moves things around on the menu, changes hotkeys, goes out of business,
fades into oblivion as fads shift, whatever&#151;I'm not even saying use the
best thing out there. There are vim-jockeys like me, and then there are true
Wizards. You might think so because I can pull some cool levers behind the
curtain, but no. For the likes of those, look to a small handful of folks of
whom I only know 3 by name.

The first of which needs no name. The spiritual leader of the Free (as in Libre)
Software movement, a man so abrasive he makes Linus Torvalds who'll flip the
bird at a room full of powerful people look tame. Richard Matthew Stallman,
known simply as RMS... well, he wrote the darn thing, so you'd expect it. eMacs
is more powerful in every way than vim, and the legacy of smaller predecessors
that built up to it, the most famous of which is vi, alternatively written by
Ken Thompson and Bill Joy, the inventor and re-inventor of Unix respectively.

Ya follow? You really don't need to. This is just tech history flex prattle.
Fun, but ultimately just to make the point that the only other people I know who
have transcended the power of text manipulation are Python maintainer Raymond
something...

**Perplexity**: [Raymond Hettinger](https://youtu.be/UANN2Eu6ZnM?si=lEjCzTsec-b1Ir3-&t=32) is a prominent Python core developer and maintainer. He has been a prolific contributor to the CPython project for over a decade[5]. Hettinger is known for his work on improving Python's performance and design, particularly in areas such as dictionaries and numerical operations[4][5].

Some of Hettinger's notable contributions include:

1. Enhancing Python dictionaries, making them more efficient and compact[4].
2. Implementing key-sharing, compaction, and versioning features in Python 3.6 dictionaries[4].
3. Giving presentations and talks on Python best practices and optimizations[3][5].

Hettinger is also recognized for his efforts in training Python programmers. He has personally trained about 5,000 programmers and his company, Mutable Minds Inc., has trained approximately 13,000 people cumulatively[4].

His expertise and contributions have made him a respected figure in the Python community, often cited for his insights on writing "Pythonic" code and optimizing Python performance[3].

And the last one is just [some random guy on the
internet](https://youtu.be/XRpHIa-2XCE?si=RCOoub5ytiehp2CP&t=886) who actually
talks about these same issues the way I think about them and learned eMacs in a
year (green with jealousy). But there are certain rabbit holes even I do not go
down, and so far in my life the editor I admire most is eMacs. No. Life is too
short for that journey into text wonderland. For those of you who want the most
wizardly ways and the text editor that is a fine operating system, eMacs may be
for you. But there's a reason vim key controls are the thing included in
everything else. 

Vim hit that magical happy medium that makes the text-mastery skills accessible
to mere mortals. And so, vim. Even though I really use NeoVim right now, whose
filename you type is just `nvim`, it's still vim. Just rolls off the tongue
better and gets to the spirit of the thing, just like when we say Linux, what we
really mean is GNU/Linux (another RMS story), but we'll get to that later.
