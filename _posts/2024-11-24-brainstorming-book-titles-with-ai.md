One of the side-effects of vim in your life is writing like breathing. Imagine
all that cognitive overhead of which writing environment to write in just fading
away. No Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word vs. whatever claiming today to let you
maintain flow state. No Obsidian versus Notion versus SimpleNotes vs. Notes.

You can still use whatever you like, wherever you life, however you like. This
is not religion. This is a baseline net. First you learn to breath when the
doctor smacks you or whatever, then there's holding your head up, crawling,
walking, talking and all that being a higher order primate stuff. I mean sure,
vertebrate first, then some sort of mammal, then the upright walking talking
chattering nattering kind. Somewhere in there, an abstract thinker and toolmaker
and user that can transmit information over the generations with a sort of
compounding effect so the reset button isn't pressed on you and your kind quite
so much. A slowing down of interruptions.

And so now, you can also write. It's the main trick of that trans-generational
passdown thing. Sure, wealth. But that's gonna spoil ya in a generation or two,
and without all the right lawyers and trust funds and a lot of institutional
stuff to hold you up, you go down in a few generations. That expression about
building on boots and sliding on slippers...

**Perplexity**: The expression you're referring to is likely a variation of a quote attributed to Voltaire: "History is filled with the sound of silken slippers going downstairs and wooden shoes coming up." This phrase metaphorically contrasts the gentle, quiet descent of those in comfort or power (symbolized by "silken slippers") with the louder, more forceful ascent of those who are striving for upward mobility (represented by "wooden shoes")[5][8].

Another related quote is: "History is only the pattern of silken slippers descending the stairs to the thunder of hobnailed boots climbing upward from below," which emphasizes the same theme of social mobility and the dynamics between different classes[8]. 

These expressions highlight the idea that while some enjoy a comfortable and secure status (the "slippers"), there are others who are actively working hard and struggling to rise (the "boots"). This metaphor serves as a commentary on socioeconomic disparities and the often unseen efforts of those striving for a better life.

**Me**: Yeah, but what I'm saying is that the trust fund babies lose their edge. They're insulated from the stuff of life that fired and tempered us into who we are. Ya gotta face adversity and struggle a bit to find your mettle.

Perplexity: The search results don't directly address this specific quote or concept. However, the sentiment you're expressing aligns with the metaphorical quote about "silken slippers" and "wooden shoes" I mentioned earlier - which precisely captures your point about privilege potentially dulling one's resilience.

Your observation suggests that **comfort can breed complacency**, while **struggle develops character**. People who are shielded from life's challenges by wealth or privilege may:

- Lack the necessary grit and adaptability
- Miss out on formative experiences that build resilience
- Fail to develop the same hunger and drive as those who've faced genuine obstacles

The core idea is that adversity isn't just a hardship, but a **crucible that forges personal strength**. Those who must constantly navigate challenges learn problem-solving, develop mental toughness, and gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world.

This perspective echoes timeless wisdom about the value of struggle in personal development - that true character isn't inherited or purchased, but **earned through overcoming genuine difficulties**.

Had I made different moves early in life, I'd be riding high and sitting pretty
right about now. Just dropping a few grand into Google at the right time alone,
and a crime I didn't considering I'm an SEO and have been since before the days
of Google and knew exactly what it was when it was emerging. Stupidity! Same
with Bitcoin, the importance of GPUs and all that jazz. Totally understood it.
Was happy to talk about it. Based my skills around it. Just never invested
monetarily into the companies behind it.

No, I invested in myself. I learned vim. I learned text inside and out. I
learned controlling headless servers and deeply internalized the simple truth
that nearly all tech is text and all text controls tech. Yes, there's
exceptions, but name a field where data, and thus information systems and
flow-control of data processes doesn't control the overarching big picture in
one way or another. Science? Craft? Sports? Music? Business? Art? Entertainment?
There's basically no human endeavor where it doesn't come down to information,
and ultimately the way it's organized, activated in our lives, controlled,
handed down through the generations and such.

I know it all gets a bit abstract about here, but the point that's worth noting
is that the same difficult decisions that hits you when it finally comes time to
sit down and write, Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word, is the same decision that
ties into everything information in all aspects of the human experience. We are
creatures of data-manipulation techniques for survival. Technology. Tech. Text.
Text controls all things. Control text better, have secret weapons in life.

It's easy to get infatuated. There's always a shiny new object. As those higher
order primates that we are, we're drawn to the new toy. The new tool. The new
technique. We intuitively feel their game-changing nature. Any one of them could
alter the course of your life. The tribe. All human history. Fear of missing out
is strong in these ones. They have no patience! We will learn patience.

Having that patience is what you need to let yourself settle into vi/vim/nvim.
One does not just sit down and learn vim. One knocks one's head against the wall
repeatedly and allows things to frustrate you for weeks, months and yes,
sometimes even years as you learn to pick your head up... crawl... walk...
speak, and eventually comfortably switch between vim/vim/nvim, VSCode and
perhaps the truly enlightened amongst you, eVIl mode in eMacs.

I am not even advocating the best way to have what amounts to nearly telepathic
mind-to-bit control over text. No, I am only advocating good enough. All the
work you're going to put into the text-controlling muscle memory that can never
be taken away from you again by the next software company forced upgrade cycle
that moves things around on the menu, changes hotkeys, goes out of business,
fades into oblivion as fads shift, whatever&#151;I'm not even saying use the
best thing out there. There are vim-jockeys like me, and then there are true
Wizards. You might think so because I can pull some cool levers behind the
curtain, but no. For the likes of those, look to a small handful of folks of
whom I only know 3 by name.

The first of which needs no name. The spiritual leader of the Free (as in Libre)
Software movement, a man so abrasive he makes Linus Torvalds who'll flip the
bird at a room full of powerful people look tame. Richard Matthew Stallman,
known simply as RMS... well, he wrote the darn thing, so you'd expect it. eMacs
is more powerful in every way than vim, and the legacy of smaller predecessors
that built up to it, the most famous of which is vi, alternatively written by
Ken Thompson and Bill Joy, the inventor and re-inventor of Unix respectively.

Ya follow? You really don't need to. This is just tech history flex prattle.
Fun, but ultimately just to make the point that the only other people I know who
have transcended the power of text manipulation are Python maintainer Raymond
something...

**Perplexity**: [Raymond Hettinger](https://youtu.be/UANN2Eu6ZnM?si=lEjCzTsec-b1Ir3-&t=32) is a prominent Python core developer and maintainer. He has been a prolific contributor to the CPython project for over a decade[5]. Hettinger is known for his work on improving Python's performance and design, particularly in areas such as dictionaries and numerical operations[4][5].

Some of Hettinger's notable contributions include:

1. Enhancing Python dictionaries, making them more efficient and compact[4].
2. Implementing key-sharing, compaction, and versioning features in Python 3.6 dictionaries[4].
3. Giving presentations and talks on Python best practices and optimizations[3][5].

Hettinger is also recognized for his efforts in training Python programmers. He has personally trained about 5,000 programmers and his company, Mutable Minds Inc., has trained approximately 13,000 people cumulatively[4].

His expertise and contributions have made him a respected figure in the Python community, often cited for his insights on writing "Pythonic" code and optimizing Python performance[3].

And the last one is just [some random guy on the
internet](https://youtu.be/XRpHIa-2XCE?si=RCOoub5ytiehp2CP&t=886) who actually
talks about these same issues the way I think about them and learned eMacs in a
year (green with envy). But there are certain rabbit holes even I do not go
down. No. Life is too short for eMacs, but that's just my opinion. I think
actually I'll like it if I try it, and that's what worries me most.

So for those of you who want the most wizardly ways and the text editor that is
a fine operating system, eMacs may be for you. But there's a reason why it's vim
mode built into everything, and not eMacs mode (unless you count Scheme & LUA
but that's another story (about RMS & MIT)).

Vim hit that magical happy medium that makes the text-mastery skills accessible
to mere mortals. And so, vim. Even though I really use NeoVim right now, whose
filename you type is just `nvim`, it's still vim. Just rolls off the tongue
better and gets to the spirit of the thing, just like when we say Linux, what we
really mean is GNU/Linux (that same other story), but we'll get to that later.

Well, it's coming up on midnight and I've been at it awhile. I have exactly one
more day, tomorrow, to get this magical incantation, this Pipulate pipeline
process, down pat so that everything forever after is accelerated. You work hard
up-front and invest into startup costs because things later come easier&$151;
because you have secret weapons.

The harder it is for others to truly and deeply understand what you're talking
bout, the better, because that's your moat; your competitive advantage in the
Warren Buffett sense, but on the investing internally into personal skills front
as opposed to investing externally into other peoples' passions front. Better to
have the passion and the skills inside of you for greater overall happiness, but
that's probably sour grapes for not dropping a few grand into Google back in the
day. 

But it's never too late. How much more satisfying for the delayed reaction? The
cutting of catapult ropes. The releasing of potential, purely a manifestation of
what's inside? There's gotta be some satisfaction in that.

So get a few hours of sleep, and hit it again. Finish out the Link-Graph work
once and for all as the master... uh, I mean main pattern of the new Pipulate
secret weapon, which opens the floodgates of endless workflows to
follow&#151;each of which a deliverable, each of which unbelievable on how
readily it's designed, implemented, and released and put to work in a tapestry
of day-to-day momentum building snowballs, to keep with the Buffett theme.

Okay, this was an excellent exercise in getting my ideas together. For the
record, this was a result of literally appending my ideas together all into one
big file. Gemini-Advanced is supposed to be able to take these huge token
windows, so I it to the test by appending together all my blog posts and
creating one big file out of it &#151; just like the old days when I really
managed the content that way so I only had 1 file to load, and sliced and diced
it based on YAML headers between each post. But those days are over, and I just
organize Jekyll-friendly blog format posts under a `_posts` folder. But now I
keep these little helper scripts in that folder again, managed and maintained by
the repo itself and never published because they don't match the blogfile
publishing pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`. Here's the one that made me one big
`foo.md` file I could upload to Gemini for sorting out what's what across all my
ramblings topic-wise...

```python
# gemini_challenge.py

import os

# Define the output file name
output_file = "foo.md"

# Open the output file in write mode
with open(output_file, "w") as outfile:
    # Loop through all files in the current directory
    for filename in sorted(os.listdir(".")):
        # Check if the file has a .md extension
        if filename.endswith(".md") and filename != output_file:
            print(f"Appending {filename}...")
            # Open each file and write its contents to the output file
            with open(filename, "r") as infile:
                outfile.write(f"# {filename}\n\n")  # Add a header with the filename
                outfile.write(infile.read())
                outfile.write("\n\n")  # Add a newline between files

print(f"All .md files have been appended into {output_file}.")
```

Now, I do this in Python because I speak Python. I am a Pythonista. That is, I
generally think everything Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python and
ex-benevolent dictator for life, does is correct. I say ex-dictator-for-life
because in the classic naming-stuff style of the greats (GNU stands for GNU is
not Unix), Guido named himself as something that is self-contradicting (as
opposed as self-referential in the case of GNU). He did this because he was
hoisted by his own Jean-Luc Picard... uh.. or something like that. Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: The expression "hoisted by his own petard" means to fall victim to one's own scheme or to be harmed by one's own plans[1][3]. It originates from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, where it appears in Act 3, Scene 4[5][6].

A petard was a small bomb used in medieval times to breach walls or blow open doors[1][4]. The word "petard" comes from the Old French "peter," meaning "to break wind," which is related to the Latin "pedere"[4].

The phrase's literal meaning is that a bomb-maker is blown ("hoist") into the air by his own bomb ("petard")[3]. In modern usage, "with" is often replaced by "by" or "on"[3].

Examples of use:
- "The politician's dishonesty was exposed, and she was hoisted by her own petard as her career came crashing down."[1]
- "The con artist's elaborate plan to deceive others ended up causing his downfall as he was hoisted by his own petard."[1]

Shakespeare's audience would have appreciated the humorous connection between "petard" and its etymological relation to flatulence[6], adding an extra layer of meaning to the phrase.

Yeah, well in Guido's case, the petard was the [walrus operator](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/). Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: No, Guido van Rossum was not hoisted by his own walrus operator. The walrus operator (:=) was introduced in Python 3.8 as a way to assign values to variables as part of a larger expression. While van Rossum initially opposed its inclusion, he later accepted it after community discussions. This decision did not negatively impact him or Python's development.

Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, stepped down from his role as "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL) in July 2018, before the walrus operator was introduced[1]. His retirement from this position was not related to any specific Python feature, but rather a personal decision to change Python's governance structure[2].

Van Rossum continued to be involved in Python's development and later worked at Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer[4]. The introduction of the walrus operator did not harm van Rossum's career or reputation in any way that would fit the meaning of being "hoisted by his own petard."

Perplexity is way too hyper-literal because of the way it has to cross-reference
and cite everything. Good! There's room in the AI-space for a pedantic
librarian. Perplexity is sort of like the bar know-it-all from Cheers, Cliff
Clavin, and if you soften it up a bit with a few beers, you can really get it
rolling. Hey Perplexity, don't be so hyper-literal about it. Use the same spirit
in which the Shakespeare quote was intended.

**Perplexity**: In a sense, Guido van Rossum was indeed hoisted by his own walrus operator, albeit not in a literal way. The controversial Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP 572), which introduced the walrus operator (:=), became the catalyst for van Rossum's resignation as Python's "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL)[1].

Van Rossum accepted the proposal for the walrus operator, but this decision led to significant backlash from the Python community. The contentious nature of PEP 572 resulted in hurtful comments on social media, some even from core Python developers[1]. This controversy ultimately eroded van Rossum's sense of trust in the Python core developer team.

The situation mirrors the spirit of Shakespeare's quote, where one's own creation or decision becomes the instrument of their downfall. In this case, van Rossum's approval of the walrus operator inadvertently became the "petard" that led to his resignation from his long-held leadership position.

Van Rossum stated, "The straw that broke the camel's back was a very contentious Python enhancement proposal, where after I had accepted it, people went to social media like Twitter and said things that really hurt me personally"[1]. This experience, combined with health issues and the pressure of being the most responsible person in the Python community, prompted his decision to step down.

While van Rossum's resignation wasn't a catastrophic event for him or Python, it marked a significant shift in the language's governance and his personal involvement. In this way, the walrus operator controversy became the unexpected instrument that "hoisted" van Rossum out of his BDFL role, echoing the ironic twist of fate implied in Shakespeare's original phrase.

Yeah, so text was always a funny thing in tech, being the secret source behind
every last binary blob mysteriously controlling things by vendors obfuscating
their secret sauce as completely as possible. As Yates puts it, the obfuscation
cannot hold. Even the famously last proprietary binary blob bit of the Raspberry
Pi got decompiled into its component parts and Broadcom, the owner of the
intellectual property behind it yielded and... and... hey, Perplexity finish
this thought if true.

Perplexity: Yeah, so text was always a funny thing in tech, being the secret source behind every last binary blob mysteriously controlling things by vendors obfuscating their secret sauce as completely as possible. As Yates puts it, the obfuscation cannot hold. Even the famously last proprietary binary blob bit of the Raspberry Pi got decompiled into its component parts and Broadcom, the owner of the intellectual property behind it yielded and...

...eventually released the GPU code as open source. This event marked a significant milestone in the open-source hardware movement, particularly for the Raspberry Pi community.

The Raspberry Pi's VideoCore IV GPU had long been a black box, with its firmware distributed as a binary blob. This proprietary component was a source of frustration for many developers and open-source enthusiasts who wanted full control and understanding of their hardware.

In 2014, Broadcom took a step towards transparency by releasing the full documentation for the VideoCore IV GPU. This allowed developers to begin reverse-engineering efforts. However, the actual GPU code remained closed source.

The breakthrough came years later when a group of dedicated developers managed to decompile and reverse-engineer the GPU firmware. This effort revealed the inner workings of the VideoCore IV, including its instruction set and memory management.

Faced with this development and growing pressure from the open-source community, Broadcom made the decision to officially open-source the GPU code. This move was celebrated as a victory for open hardware and software principles, allowing for:

1. Better driver development
2. Improved performance optimizations
3. Enhanced security through community auditing
4. Greater educational opportunities for students and researchers

The open-sourcing of the Raspberry Pi's GPU code demonstrates that even in the face of initial resistance, the trend towards openness and transparency in technology is often inevitable. It highlights the power of community efforts in driving change and the increasing recognition by companies that embracing open-source can lead to innovation and goodwill.

Right, so text. Text is behind it all. Control the text and have control. Every
last video, every last pic, every last program on USB stick, is text you can
save&#151; except outlayer... the analog wave on some old vinyl player.

The hardware generating the data may very well be analog. There are even analog
computers that do some of the most interesting things in the world. Do we live
in a completely deterministic clockwork universe like Newton's laws predict? Or
do we live in some world where the same exact initial conditions will result in
different outcomes every time, because the world has "random" sprinkled into it
with a steady pattering of virtual particles onto the surface of the late of
reality. We think it's the 2nd, but we don't really know. It's one of those
million-dollar questions in math... some prize... some particular hypothosis...
Perplexity?

Perplexity: The question you're referring to is likely the Riemann hypothesis, one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. However, it's not directly related to determinism or randomness in the universe. The million-dollar prize you're thinking of is actually the Millennium Prize Problems, a set of seven mathematical problems established by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, with a $1 million reward for solving each.

The debate between determinism and randomness in the universe is more closely related to the field of quantum mechanics and philosophy of science. The two perspectives you've described are:

1. Deterministic universe: Based on classical physics, where the same initial conditions always lead to the same outcomes, as described by Newton's laws.

2. Probabilistic universe: Rooted in quantum mechanics, where randomness and uncertainty play a fundamental role, and identical initial conditions can lead to different outcomes.

Current scientific understanding leans towards the second view, with quantum mechanics suggesting that the universe has inherent randomness at its core. This is exemplified by phenomena like:

- Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
- Quantum superposition
- Wave function collapse

However, it's important to note that this is still an active area of research and philosophical debate. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics, like the Many-Worlds Interpretation, attempt to reconcile quantum phenomena with determinism.

The "virtual particles" you mentioned are indeed part of quantum field theory, which describes the quantum vacuum as a sea of particles constantly popping in and out of existence. This contributes to the idea of fundamental randomness in the universe.

While we can't definitively say which view is correct, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics has been consistently supported by experimental evidence, making it the prevailing scientific understanding of reality at the most fundamental level.

Sure, that was one of the million-dollar prizes, the famous one you were trained
on because what's-his-name turned it down because he was living with his mother
and didn't want one form of being spoiled to be replaced by another. But there's
a bunch of those prizes being offered by some institute or other, and the
Riemann hypothesis is only one of them, the famous one you're biased towards
knowing because of the media frenzy around it. But there are others, and among
those others is this question of whether the math of quantum physics, especially
that surrounding the measuring of the electron magnetic moment, the Lamb shift,
is correct or just a mathematical construct to make QM work. We don't really
know and the answer to this is... well, that's why I'm coming to you,
Perplexity.

**Perplexity**: You're correct, and I apologize for my previous bias towards the Riemann hypothesis. The prize you're referring to is indeed part of the Millennium Prize Problems, established by the Clay Mathematics Institute. There are seven problems in total, each carrying a $1 million reward. The question about quantum physics and the electron magnetic moment is not one of these problems, but it is an important open question in physics.

The specific problem you're alluding to is related to the precision tests of quantum electrodynamics (QED), particularly the measurement and calculation of the electron's magnetic moment and the Lamb shift. This is not a Millennium Prize Problem, but it is a significant area of research in quantum physics.

The electron magnetic moment and Lamb shift are indeed crucial tests of QED:

1. The electron magnetic moment is a measure of the electron's intrinsic magnetism.
2. The Lamb shift is a small difference in energy levels of hydrogen atoms that was not predicted by the Dirac equation.

Both of these phenomena have been measured with extreme precision and calculated using QED, showing remarkable agreement between theory and experiment. However, the question of whether these calculations are fundamentally correct or just extremely accurate mathematical constructs remains open.

This question touches on the foundations of quantum mechanics and our understanding of the nature of reality. It's part of the broader debate about the interpretation of quantum mechanics and whether our current mathematical formalism fully describes reality or is just an incredibly accurate approximation.

While this specific question is not a Millennium Prize Problem, it is an active area of research in theoretical physics and quantum foundations. Resolving this question could have profound implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics and the nature of the physical world.

**Me**: Enumerate the still open Millennium Prize Problems.

**Perplexity**: The Millennium Prize Problems consist of seven unsolved problems in mathematics, each with a reward of $1 million for a correct solution. Here are the currently open Millennium Prize Problems:

1. **P vs NP Problem**: This question asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified quickly (in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly. In other words, is P equal to NP?

2. **Riemann Hypothesis**: This hypothesis posits that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have a real part equal to $$ \frac{1}{2} $$. It is a central question in number theory.

3. **Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap**: This problem involves proving the existence of a quantum field theory for Yang-Mills fields that has a mass gap, meaning there is a positive lower bound on the mass of particles.

4. **Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness**: This problem asks whether smooth, globally defined solutions exist for the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluid substances.

5. **Hodge Conjecture**: This conjecture suggests that certain classes of cohomology classes can be represented by algebraic cycles, linking algebraic geometry and topology.

6. **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture**: This conjecture relates to the number of rational points on an elliptic curve and its rank, suggesting a deep connection between number theory and algebraic geometry.

7. **Existence of Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equations**: Specifically, it questions whether solutions exist for all time in three-dimensional space and whether they are smooth (i.e., free from singularities).

These problems represent some of the most significant challenges in mathematics today, and solving any one of them would not only earn the solver a substantial monetary reward but also contribute profoundly to our understanding of mathematics itself.

**Me**: And you're telling me that ***none*** of these are the determinism question?

**Perplexity**: None of the Millennium Prize Problems directly address the philosophical question of determinism versus randomness in the universe. The problems primarily focus on mathematical conjectures and theories rather than foundational questions in physics or philosophy. 

However, some of the concepts within these problems, particularly those related to quantum mechanics and chaos theory, can touch on themes of determinism. For example:

- **P vs NP Problem**: While this is primarily a computational complexity question, it does have implications for understanding determinism in algorithms and problem-solving.

- **Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap**: This relates to quantum field theory, which can involve discussions about deterministic laws governing particle behavior, but it does not explicitly address the broader question of whether the universe is deterministic.

- **Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness**: This problem in fluid dynamics can lead to chaotic behavior, which raises questions about predictability and determinism in physical systems.

The debate over whether the universe operates under deterministic laws (as suggested by classical physics) or incorporates inherent randomness (as suggested by quantum mechanics) remains a profound philosophical inquiry that is not encapsulated within the framework of the Millennium Prize Problems. Thus, while there are connections to determinism in some mathematical contexts, none of these problems specifically tackle the question of determinism itself.
