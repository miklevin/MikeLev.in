Today is going to be a very busy day! Put as much as possible in storage. Get
the place about as empty as you can, but for the stuff you can move on the day
before the official out-day. There's still time for morning thoughts and the
corresponding livecast! That stuff is more important than ever as you massage
your website into place and get organized.
