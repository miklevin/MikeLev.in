Much of life is about not being pushed around. Much of life's lessons are in
Dr. Seuss' I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew. I feel that effect often
in my life. Most people you interact with are like the traveler the protagonist
encounters. One must be wary of their type. They are the Walrus. Walruses for
lack of the knowing and the doing of things must trick Carpenters into doing
their bidding. When you are a talented Carpenter, you are also a magnet for
such Walruses. You may not know it when you're young and could become ensnared
on your first journey or two out into the world, such as I was... several
times. The definition of stupid is repeating your same mistakes without
learning. Yup, I was stupid. But such is life. What doesn't kill you makes you
stronger, and oh how strong I have become!
