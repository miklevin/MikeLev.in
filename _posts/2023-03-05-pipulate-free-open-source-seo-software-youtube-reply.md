I have a premise with which the mainstream disagrees: no one in the SEO world actually wants to become technical beyond Excel macros or maybe GSheet AppScripts. I say pishaw to the mainstream. I say we just entered a new world where generic and usually Ubuntu Linux, often headless, is the great interoperable and long-lived API of tech. Live there. Learn it.

Use genuine Linux Python via JupyterLab on Windows and Macs through VM instances of Linux, or of course cloud or bare metal headless Linux instances like Raspberry Pi's. The real skill is mocking it up in JuputerLab then turning it into a sync-updatable 24x7 Linux service. Start on your laptop. Move creations elsewhere anywhere.

The creations are capable of being run on schedules, Python events of any sort such as SERP scraping and screenshots, emailing zips and HTML reports. Update whatever database for later trending. Often it's a zero tech-liability local SQLiTE3 .db database accessed as if a Pytnon dict.

This is FOSS SEO. This is way more accessible than people think these days and hits on all the hot topics for long term employability, resistance to obsolescence and vendor profit driven interface churn that messes with your muscle memory. Proprietary always has a place and it's unusually as a data source you're connecting to that you can't get any other way. Full disclosure, I work for Moz as of last Monday.

What else? Mastering vim over the years by using it daily for journaling is one of the principles of the thing. What's a good tech movement without a spiritual aspect? VSCodr ad good as it may be begins your march down the dark side. This is my own opinion and does not reflect, yadda yadda.

We join tables of data primarily as a necessary step in the construction of any SEO deliverable. Some tables you'll gather data free somehow and other table's you'll pay for. Someone's been running just the queries you need in just the right way for ages and you can just buy access to that. Or you can do some limited local scraping and have a junior version. Or not so junior if it doesn't need trending history or vast numbers of queries.

So are you ready to help evolve Pipulate, version like I guess 3 by now. This is the time we actually interact with the public using it. Let me know how it goes and feel free to follow up to this ridiculously long response with questions, comments or whatever. The actual Frankenstein pulling the switch to light up Pipulate moment hasn't come yet becauseâ€¦

We'll, I'm wrapping Macs into the equation (a drinkme.sh for macs). I also want to simplify the scripts on both sides to bare minimum so I can take a build it up as we add feature to Pipulate approach and force the updating of the WSL instance to the latest instance (won't wipe out work on /repos or the Jupyter config).

Thoughts so far?
