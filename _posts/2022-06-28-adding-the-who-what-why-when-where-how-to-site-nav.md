headline: Revolutionizing Life Management with Linux, Python, vim & git
description: I'm proposing a new way to manage life as a whole, by creating and automating tasks to be internalized and passed onto muscle memory. To help with this, I'm suggesting the use of Linux, Python, vim & git. I've added the Who, What, Why, When, Where & How to my website's navigation, and I'm now working on creating the pages to go along with it. Come find out more about my revolutionary idea and how it can help you manage life

Fundamentally, life is management. But we must think about this management not
just as economic, but rather managing life as a whole. In my case specifically
I'm talking about

Don't suffer your success because success doesn't come easy. It's better to
suffer your failures, rinse and repeat until you love your success.

I got the qualifiers links in MikeLev.in navigation: Who, What, Why, When,
Where & How, though the pages don't exist yet. Making those pages is a
priority.

# WHAT

Pushed most over to /what/. This is just draft:

What I propose is for you to casually create and manage automations throughout
life without having to dedicate excessive time to developing and keeping such
skills.

I propose that you “internalize it”, passing it onto automatic muscle memory as
you do driving and reading-for-pleasure, creating an internal asset better than
fame or fortune.

This is a rigid structure for one and only one aspect of your life, that which
technically enables you to do other things, pursuing other interests in life
unencumbered by startup costs. You are your own tech because being so is just
basic literacy today.

To this end, I propose Linux, Python, vim & git
