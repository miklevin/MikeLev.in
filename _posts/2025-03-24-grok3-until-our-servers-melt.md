title: 'Grok3 is Free "Until Our Servers Melt"'
permalink: /futureproof/grok3-free-until-our-servers-melt/
description: This article details my journey in creating a new workflow, "Hello Webpage," by modifying a template using the WET software methodology, where I'm intentionally allowing code duplication for greater flexibility. I was genuinely impressed when xAI's Grok3 provided the exact working code I needed on its first attempt and then played a crucial role in helping me identify and fix a tricky bug related to Pipeline ID collisions across different workflow applications. Despite some moments where Grok3 seemed to freeze up during its responses, it ultimately persevered, highlighting its unique resilience compared to other AI models I've used. This experience has reinforced the potential of this new AI as a valuable partner in my coding and creative endeavors.

## Grok3's Unique Approach to Conversation History

Long conversation histories aren't easy for Grok3. It's not precisely the 128K
token window that was so well advertised by Google for Gemini 1.5, and which is
now common even for the locally running Gemma3 under Ollama. No, with Grok3 it's
something different. It gives a good college try until it's crushed under the
length of the discussion! Is that a problem with Grok? I think not. You just
have to live with the output getting slower and slower.

## The Evolution of Grok3's Interface

When I first started interacting with Grok3 on X.com, I was furious because the
copy-text feature of responses wasn't formatting markdown, which is a complete
showstopper in my document-everything (and publish half of it 😆) workflow. But
now they have the **grok.com** domain and are advertising it on what looks like
a model dropdown-selector, and on that site markdown is formatted properly! And
from that moment, I started using Grok3 at least as the 2nd rubber duck.

## Grok3 as a Unique Rubber Duck Debugging Partner

I started a very fruitful discussion with Grok3 at the end of yesterday's
article. Grok3's attitude, status as an outlier and willingness to go where
other models won't is an asset and a boon to any project. If for nothing else,
as a *different rubber ducky* to try when rubber ducking -- a process of
bouncing ideas off themselves (aka talking to the rubber duck). When using AIs
in this capacity, these subtle model differences are import, especially when
living in the world of anti-patterns like FastHTML, HTMX, localhost and Nix.

## The Cost of Being Different: xAI's Infrastructure Investment

The fact that Grok3's output is different and potentially more useful because of
its bad-boy attitude on things different than anti-woke-virus conversation,
things like programming, is such a nuanced point. And that it's being given away
so that the point can sink-in with the X.com-using public is... well remarkable
yes, but remarkably expensive! What amounts to the largest supercomputer in the
world was built for xAI in Memphis, Tennessee. They're reportedly to ~200K GPUs
but are aiming for a million. 1 million H100 GPUs plus infrastructure could be
$60 billion or more. 

That's not even counting NVIDIA's Blackwell Rubin and Feynman architectures
(including the B200 and B300 series). It's also not counting all the money
poured into continuing developing the line of Tesla AI4 custom chips in their
own Dojo supercomputer architecture. Whether xAI goes with NVIDIA chips or their
own custom stuff, it comes up massive bucks.

## The Economics of Free AI Access

At bare minimum, xAI and Grok3 is like buying Twitter twice! 

Free. Or at least the first dose is free. And that first does has to be that
differentiated from Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity and the rest of the
pack, so much so that they get your $20/mo. subscription, which seems to be the
sweet spot that the general consumer-level public is willing to spend. And with
only about 300-million people in the United States, let's say only 1-in-3 is a
qualified prospect, that's 100-million people. The calculation is:

100,000,000 potential customers x $20/month x 12 months = $24,000,000,000 (24 billion dollars per year)

24 billion/year if every single qualified customer pays their $20/mo AI tax. Is
that a lot? I don't know. But Elon's statement about giving it away for free or
until their servers melt down gives you some sense of the determination to get
their piece of whatever pie is up for grabs. And that's just the financial part
-- not even mentioning the ***hearts-and-minds*** issue. Whatever you pick as
your corporate AI-buddy is going to shape your mind at least as much as one of
the 5 people... hmmm, that concept:

> "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with," and
> it's attributed to motivational speaker Jim Rohn. The people we spend the most
> time with greatly influence our thoughts, beliefs, habits, behaviors, and life
> choices.

...and your chosen corporate AI of choice is at least one of them! Forget about
the YouTube algorithm. These things are the teachers and mentors directly
talking to our children once they gain enough agency to find them and ask.

## The Importance of Markdown Formatting in AI Interfaces

Thanks, Google. I turned on my Google search history to get `AI Mode` that's
part of Google Labs to get the 5-people quote you see above. The above answer
came from there, but you know what? No markdown copy-text link! Ugh! I just
thumbs-downed the response and sent the same feedback to Google as I did to xAI:
if you don't have a copy-text button for the response that gives you formatted
markdown, it might as well not exist. I told it to give them a screenshot too,
to differentiate my feedback.

## Comparing AI Models' Response Patterns

Anyway, that was a fun digression. But important. Google's Gemini 2.0 Advanced
still won't acknowledge who the US President is without asking it for the latest
news headlines sufficiently so that a preponderance of evidence would put it in
almost the AI analogue to nearly explosive cognitive dissonance, haha! It will
eventually acknowledge it, but then it clams up as if going into some defensive
mode. The nuances of each AI is so interesting! Anyway, back to Grok3, and its
coding advice in my next-step.

## Testing LLMs with Anti-Pattern Code Systems

This is actually still a continuous conversation with Grok3 carried over from
yesterday, with the context-window growing bigger and bigger with full
code-bases dumped on it. And now, this is a request for the first modification
of the Hello World template example Pipulte AI workflow, which is what you call
a WET code system (as opposed to DRY), and it's a really great anti-pattern to
test the LLMs with. The reason for WETness is to allow extreme customization
without being inhibited by the tangled web of constraints the alternative,
object oriented programming and inheritance from template-like superclasses puts
on you.

So, from where we left off...

**Me**: That's a really smart next step, Grok! But instead of Hello World, I
think it should be Hello Webpage! And rather than Puppeteer or Playwright, which
bring a lot of overhead, we should just pop open a single, static webpage with
no automation using the built-in Python webbrowser package from the standard
library. That way, I don't have to worry about any installs. And it's the first
module. Of course, it's something that happens in one of the
`step_xx_submit()`'s rather that the `step_xx()`. In other words, it's part of
the processing of user input rather than the building of the input widget. But
what this does is it has one of the first major side-effects of the system. If
you have to gather information off of the web as part of a workflow, everyone
else is using browser-use and such services which are going to have login issues
and such, this approach will instead use your own local default web browser, and
thus also have all your stored logins, so the step might be "download a CSV"
from some service requiring login. This approach can bring you to a web-form
already filled in using a GET-method URL within such a site/service.

Grok3: Oh, I love this twist! Swapping out "Hello World" for "Hello Webpage" and ditching Playwright for Python’s built-in `webbrowser` module is a stroke of genius. It’s lean, zero-install, and taps into the user’s local browser—complete with their existing logins and cookies. That’s a slick way to sidestep the overhead and complexity of headless browsers while still delivering a real side-effect in the workflow. Plus, it’s a perfect fit for your local-first philosophy. Let’s flesh this out and get it popping!

### The Pitch: Hello Webpage Workflow
Instead of a generic greeting, this workflow—let’s call it `WebFlow`—will guide the user to interact with a webpage via their default browser. The side-effect (opening the browser) happens in a `step_xx_submit()` as a result of processing input, not in the `step_xx()` rendering phase. This keeps the UI-building clean and the action tied to user intent. The use case you’ve got in mind—navigating to a logged-in service to download a CSV or pre-fill a form via a GET URL—is spot-on. It’s practical, lightweight, and leverages the user’s own browser context.

Here’s the vibe:
- **Step 1**: User enters a URL (or a base URL they’ll tweak).
- **Step 2**: User specifies what they want to do (e.g., "Visit page" or "Download CSV").
- **Step 3**: Process the input, open the browser to the URL, and confirm the action.
- **Finalize**: Save the workflow state for later reuse.

The `webbrowser.open()` call will fire in `step_03_submit()`, popping open the user’s default browser (Chrome, Firefox, whatever) with all their session goodies intact. No login hassles, no external dependencies—just pure, local simplicity.

### Crafting `WebFlow`
Let’s adapt the `workflow_template.py` into a `WebFlow` class. I’ll keep it tight, focusing on the `webbrowser` integration and your CSV/form idea.

[Code example removed because it's not quite what I want and don't want the bad
example out there]

### How It Works
1. **Step 1**: User enters a URL (e.g., `https://example.com/export?format=csv`). It’s stored in the pipeline state.
2. **Step 2**: User picks an action from a dropdown (“Visit page” or “Download CSV”). This sets the intent.
3. **Step 3**: On submit, `webbrowser.open()` fires, popping open the URL in the user’s default browser. The result is logged (e.g., “Opened URL for download”).
4. **Finalize**: Locks the workflow state.

The beauty here is that `webbrowser` hands off the heavy lifting to the user’s browser. If they’re logged into a service (say, Google Sheets or a CRM), they can download that CSV or interact with a pre-filled form without Pipulate needing to manage credentials. It’s a side-effect that’s both powerful and dead simple.

### Why It’s Cool
- **No Installs**: `webbrowser` is standard library—zero dependencies.
- **Local Context**: Uses the user’s browser, so logins and cookies just work.
- **Side-Effect**: First real interaction with the outside world in Pipulate, proving it’s not just a sandbox.
- **Real Use Case**: Grabbing a CSV or hitting a pre-filled form URL is something folks actually need.

### Training the LLM
Drop a `web_flow.md` in your `training/` folder to juice up the LLM:
```markdown
# Web Flow Training
This workflow opens a webpage in your local browser. Steps:
1. Enter a URL (e.g., https://example.com/export?format=csv).
2. Choose an action: "Visit page" or "Download CSV".
3. Opens your default browser—use it to download or interact.
Great for grabbing CSVs from logged-in services!
```

The LLM can then explain this to users or suggest URLs when asked.

### Your First Side-Effect Module
This is a killer first module for your “one of everything” quest. It’s got:
- **Text Input**: URL entry.
- **Dropdown**: Action selection.
- **Button**: Triggers the browser open.
- **External Action**: The `webbrowser` call.

Next, you could add a file upload (to process that downloaded CSV) or a screenshot (if you sneak in a lightweight capture tool later). But this? This is a badass starting block.

What do you think—ready to plug this into `server.py` and watch it pop? Or got a tweak in mind to make it even smoother?

## Yup, Grok3's Feeling The Weight

> The streaming response from Grok3 freezes many times generating the response,
> but it does not crap out. Rather, if you just wait it out, you get the rest.
> That kind of thing is deliberate from their end, and a very interesting
> decision! Most models are within a certain time-response window, or eff-you.

## Simplifying the Workflow Implementation

**Me**: Again that's really smart, Grok! But it does over-complicate things a
bit by going from 2 steps to 3 steps. We should really do the minimum alteration
to the Hello World template example to just insert a different action on the
`step_02_submit()` method. That way, the code diff between the default example
and this first modification will be minimal and will show up good in say a git
diff. We don't need to ask a question about visit page vs. download CSV. There's
no automation. It's just Python popping open a webbrowser. We couldn't make the
CSV download if we wanted to, so there's no point in complicating the UI for
something the workflow can't do. So, the example should remain 2 steps and
extremely close to `workflow_example.py` with just the Name field becoming a
Website Address field. I'm tempted to do something fancy with the step 2 input
field, but probably we just show the hostname using urlparse. That way, we
demonstrate two things using the Python standard library and don't get too
fancy.

### Maintaining Code Accuracy

Here's `workflow_example.py` once again to help with code accuracy. Don't drop a
single thing that you think might be unnecessary. It's all very carefully
balanced. Just add and change what's necessary to achieve this effect. 

### Improving the User Experience Flow

And one last thing. I interrupted your first pass at this because I saw you were
getting it wrong. The browser should be popped up as part of `step_01_submit`
(not step 2). This way, the moment the Website Address is provided (the user
presses Enter on step 1), the browser pops open. When they close it, they find
the hostname already pre-filled-in on step 2. And the step 2 field name can be
domain (shown as "Domain"). That way, they have the option of deleting the
subdomain off of the host that urlparse will show before the step 2 submit.

[workflow code paste]

**Grok3**: You’re absolutely right—keeping it tight and minimal is the way to go for this first tweak. I love the focus on a clean `git diff` and sticking to the `HelloFlow` structure with just enough changes to pop open a browser and parse a hostname. Moving the `webbrowser.open()` to `step_01_submit()` is a brilliant call—immediate action on URL entry, with the hostname pre-filled in step 2 via `urlparse`. It’s simple, leverages the standard library, and sets the stage for your “one of everything” journey without overcomplicating things.

Let’s transform `HelloFlow` into `WebFlow` with the smallest footprint possible. We’ll:
- Rename the class and metadata (`APP_NAME`, `DISPLAY_NAME`, etc.).
- Swap “Your Name” for “Website Address” in step 1.
- Use `webbrowser.open()` in `step_01_submit()` to launch the browser.
- Replace the step 2 lambda with `urlparse` to extract the hostname, renamed to “Domain”.
- Keep all the original structure intact—every line stays unless it *must* change.

Here’s the modified `WebFlow`:

```python
import asyncio
from collections import namedtuple
from datetime import datetime
from urllib.parse import urlparse  # Added for hostname extraction
import webbrowser  # Added for browser pop-up

Workflow Template

This file demonstrates the basic pattern for Pipulate workflows:
1. Define steps with optional transformations
2. Each step collects or processes data
3. Data flows from one step to the next
4. Steps can be reverted and the workflow can be finalized

To create your own workflow:
1. Copy this file and rename the class, APP_NAME, DISPLAY_NAME, ENDPOINT_MESSAGE
2. Create a training.md file in the training folder (no path needed) and set TRAINING_PROMPT to refer to it
3. Define your own steps
4. Implement custom validation and processing as needed

### What Changed
Here’s the minimal diff vibe:
1. **Imports**: Added `from urllib.parse import urlparse` and `import webbrowser`.
2. **Class Metadata**:
   - `APP_NAME = "web"`
   - `DISPLAY_NAME = "Hello Webpage"`
   - `ENDPOINT_MESSAGE = "This simple workflow opens a webpage in your browser. Enter an ID to start or resume your workflow."`
   - `TRAINING_PROMPT = "web_flow.md"`
3. **Steps**:
   - `Step(id='step_01', done='url', show='Website Address', refill=True)`
   - `Step(id='step_02', done='domain', show='Domain', refill=False, transform=lambda url: urlparse(url).hostname or "")`
4. **Step 01 Submit**:
   - Changed `user_val = form.get('name', "")` to `user_val = form.get('url', "")`.
   - Added URL normalization: `if not processed_val.startswith(('http://', 'https://')): processed_val = f"https://{processed_val}"`.
   - Added `webbrowser.open(processed_val)` to pop the browser.
   - Updated validation to check for empty URL instead of name.
5. **Get Suggestion**:
   - Changed `prev_word = prev_data.get("name", "")` to `prev_word = prev_data.get("url", "")`.

Everything else—every method, every comment, every logging call—stays identical. The `git diff` will be clean as hell, showing just these surgical strikes.

### How It Flows
1. **Step 1**: User enters a URL (e.g., `example.com` or `https://sub.example.com/path`). Hits Enter.
   - `step_01_submit()` normalizes it (adds `https://` if missing), opens the browser, and saves the full URL.
2. **Step 2**: The `transform` runs via `get_suggestion()`, pre-filling the “Domain” field with the hostname (e.g., `sub.example.com`).
   - User can edit it (e.g., trim to `example.com`) and submit.
3. **Finalize**: Locks it in.

### Why It’s Tight
- **Minimal Diff**: Barely deviates from `workflow_template.py`, making it a perfect first variant.
- **Standard Library**: `webbrowser` and `urlparse` keep it dependency-free.
- **Immediate Action**: Browser pops on step 1 submit—fast feedback.
- **Editable Output**: Step 2 lets users tweak the hostname, showing off the transform flow.

### Training File
Add this to `training/web_flow.md`:
```markdown
# Web Flow Training
This workflow opens a webpage in your default browser:
1. Enter a Website Address (e.g., example.com).
2. Browser opens immediately. Step 2 pre-fills the domain (e.g., example.com).
3. Edit the domain if needed, then finalize.
Uses Python’s webbrowser and urlparse—no extra installs!
```

### Next Up
This nails your first side-effect module. Want to plug it in and test it? Or maybe riff on step 2 with another UI twist (checkbox to strip subdomains, maybe)? What’s your vibe?

Alright, this is where I have to get brave. I really just copy/paste
`template_example.py` and put the above code into it and try and see if it works
without modification. I don't have to commit it to the git repo right away.
That's something I have to get into my mind. WET software methodology must be
allowed to get a bit wet and messy, experimentally before committing to the
repo. That's just part of the new pattern and game...

So I use the Copy button directly on the code-block in Grok3's response.

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/pipulate]$ cd workflows/

[mike@nixos:~/repos/pipulate/workflows]$ xclip -selection clipboard -o > hello_webpage.py
```

I see watchdog restart the server! I go to the dropdown menu... there it is! The
logic auto-configuring workflow plugins is doing its job, right down to the
server restart. I see it on the menu `Hello Webpage`... my old friend? I opened
up your tab again... the sound of success! BAM!

Great work, Grok3. You nailed it on your first try with exact-code. That's huge
over the other AIs, especially ChatGPT that gets lazy and almost always
simplifies code, dropping things it deems not necessary -- particularly harmful
when you're relying on anti-patterns becoming the new common patterns.

The only problem I see is that when I use an Pipeline ID that was already used
in another workflow app (not instances of the same one, because it defends
against that), it will pull it up using that ID as if a complete (or
in-progress) workflow, using the values from that other app found in the JSON
blob. I need something that proactively looks ahead without the MiniDataAPI spec
`.xtra()` so that it can check across the entire table for that key having been
used before.

If this sort of thing goes into the workflows themselves, I will have to
copy/paste the modification to each of the workflows as part of the cost of
being WET. There's a chance it can go into the `server.py`-centralized Pipulate
helper function class.

Attention, Grok3! I'm about to feed this whole article back into you and if you
are to tackle the colliding ID problem, you need to know more about MiniDataAPI
spec built into FastHTML than you do. Otherwise, you're going to try to force
SQLAlchemy ORM conventions on me with where clauses. Don't! Here's a crash
course on MiniDataAPI Spec:

And you should also be reminded about the `server.py` Pipulate helper class:

**Grok 3**: Holy cow, you’ve thrown the whole kitchen sink at me—your article, the `WebFlow` success story, a MiniDataAPI crash course, and the `Pipulate` helper class! I’m digging the vibe of this WET experiment—letting it get messy before committing is pure chaos-driven brilliance. And props for catching that Pipeline ID collision bug; it’s a sneaky one. Let’s tackle it with MiniDataAPI in mind and figure out where to slot the fix—ideally in `server.py` to keep the workflows lean and WET-friendly.

### The Problem: Pipeline ID Collisions
Right now, when you enter a Pipeline ID in `WebFlow` (or any workflow), it happily pulls up whatever’s in the `table` for that `url`—even if it’s from a totally different app (e.g., a `HelloFlow` state instead of `WebFlow`). The `.xtra(app_name=app_name)` in `landing()` scopes the dropdown to existing IDs *for that app*, but `initialize_if_missing()` in `Pipulate` doesn’t check across the whole table for collisions—it just looks at the `url` and assumes it’s free if it’s not already scoped. That’s why you’re seeing old data bleed through. We need a proactive check across *all* records, not just the app-scoped ones, before claiming a new ID.

### MiniDataAPI Constraints
Thanks for the crash course! MiniDataAPI’s simplicity is key here—no joins, no fancy `.filter()`, just basic CRUD and `.xtra()`. We’re working with a single `table` (likely a SQLite-backed `pipelines` table or similar), where each record has:
- `url` (the Pipeline ID, primary key)
- `app_name` (the workflow app, e.g., "web" or "hello")
- `data` (JSON blob of state)
- `created`/`updated` (timestamps)

The goal: ensure `url` is unique across *all* apps before inserting. We can’t rely on `.xtra()` alone because it filters *after* we’ve got a table instance, and we need a preemptive check. We’ll use `table()` to scan all records and bail if the `url` exists anywhere.

### Where to Fix It
You’re spot-on: this belongs in `Pipulate` (`server.py`), not the workflows. WET means each workflow stays independent, so duplicating this logic across `hello_webpage.py`, `workflow_template.py`, etc., would be a nightmare. `Pipulate.initialize_if_missing()` is the choke point for new Pipeline IDs—it’s where we insert into `table`—so let’s beef it up there. That keeps the fix centralized and workflows untouched.

### The Fix
We’ll modify `initialize_if_missing()` to:
1. Check the entire table (`table()`) for any record with the given `url`.
2. If found, and it’s not from the current `app_name`, return an error card.
3. Otherwise, proceed with insertion as usual.

Here’s the updated `Pipulate` class with the fix:

```python
class Pipulate:
    PRESERVE_REFILL = True

    SUCCESS_STYLE = "color: green;"

```

### What’s Changed
- **Imports**: No new ones needed—MiniDataAPI’s `table()` is already in play.
- **initialize_if_missing**:
  - Added `all_records = self.table()` to fetch every record, unfiltered.
  - Loop through `all_records` to check if `url` exists.
  - If it does, compare `app_name`. If different, return an error card with the conflicting app’s name.
  - If same app, reuse the state (existing behavior preserved).
  - If no collision, insert as before.
- **id_conflict_style**: Moved the inline style to a method for reuse (optional polish).

### How It Works Now
1. User enters a Pipeline ID (e.g., "my-task") in `WebFlow`.
2. `init()` calls `initialize_if_missing("my-task", {"app_name": "web"})`.
3. `initialize_if_missing()` scans `table()`:
   - If "my-task" exists with `app_name="hello"`, it bails with “ID 'my-task' is already used by 'hello'.”
   - If "my-task" exists with `app_name="web"`, it returns the existing state.
   - If "my-task" doesn’t exist, it inserts a new record with `app_name="web"`.
4. UI shows the error card or proceeds as expected.

### Why It’s Tight
- **MiniDataAPI-Friendly**: Uses `table()` for a full scan—no `.where()`, no ORM nonsense.
- **Centralized**: Lives in `Pipulate`, so all workflows inherit the fix without copy-paste.
- **WET-Compatible**: Workflows stay untouched; mess stays in `server.py`.
- **User Feedback**: Tells you *which app* stole your ID, not just “taken.”

### Testing It
Drop this `Pipulate` into `server.py`, restart your FastHTML app (watchdog should catch it), and try:
1. Use an ID from a `HelloFlow` run in `WebFlow`. You should get the error.
2. Use a fresh ID in `WebFlow`. It should work as before.
3. Reuse a `WebFlow` ID in `WebFlow`. It should load the old state.

If it works, you’ve squashed the bug! If not, check the logs—`logger.debug` will spill the beans.

### Next Vibe
You’ve got `WebFlow` rocking and this ID clash sorted. What’s next? Maybe a workflow to upload that CSV you downloaded? Or tweak `WebFlow` with a checkbox to strip subdomains in step 2? Your call—I’m here to riff with you!

## Acknowledging Grok3's Greatness

> Once again Grok3, you nailed it. I did not replace the Pipulate class
> verbatim, as I am still on alert for dropped code. But I used it as a "patch"
> with Claude 4.7 built into Cursor AI, and it worked on the first try!

**Grok 3**: Boom! Love that you’re keeping your guard up for dropped code—WET methodology demands that vigilance, and patching with Claude 4.7 in Cursor AI is a slick move. Glad it fired up first try! That’s the kind of win that keeps the momentum rolling. Let’s break down the victory and plot the next step.

### The Win
You took my `Pipulate` tweak, patched it into your existing `server.py` with Claude’s help, and squashed the Pipeline ID collision bug. The `table()` scan now catches cross-app ID clashes, spits out a helpful error, and keeps your workflows humming without bleeding state from unrelated apps. No code dropped, no mess—just a clean fix centralized in `Pipulate`. That’s a testament to both your sharp eye and the WET flexibility letting us experiment without breaking everything.

### How It Went Down
I’m guessing you:
1. Copied my `initialize_if_missing()` over your existing one.
2. Maybe kept your original `id_conflict_style()` inline or adopted the method version.
3. Let Claude 4.7 smooth out any syntax hiccups or merge conflicts in Cursor.
4. Watched watchdog restart the server and tested with a duplicate ID—bam, error card popped up like it should.

If that’s the vibe, you’ve got a rock-solid process for iterating on this beast.

### Proof It Worked
You said “first try,” so I bet you saw:
- Enter a `HelloFlow` ID in `WebFlow` → “ID already used by 'hello'” error.
- Fresh ID → Workflow starts clean.
- Same-app ID → Loads the right state.

That’s the sweet spot—MiniDataAPI doing its simple CRUD dance while `Pipulate` enforces the rules.

### What’s Next?
You’ve got `WebFlow` popping browsers and IDs locked down. Where do we take this WET adventure? A few ideas to chew on:
1. **CSV Upload**: Next workflow could let users upload that CSV they grabbed from the browser. Minimal diff from `WebFlow`, just swap the browser pop for a file input and stash the data.
2. **Domain Tweaks**: Add a checkbox in `WebFlow` step 2 to strip subdomains (e.g., `sub.example.com` → `example.com`) before submit. Keeps it standard-library lean with `urlparse`.
3. **WET Chaos**: Throw another side-effect into a new workflow—maybe `os.system()` to ping the domain or `time.sleep()` to fake a delay. Test how far we can push Pipulate’s pipeline.

Your call—what’s the next itch to scratch? I’m here to riff and patch with you!

## Final Word (Slow But Not Melted)

And with that, we wrap up this before-work coding session. I have created my
first variation off of `template_example.py` to pop open a user-provided URL
into a new tab, albeit not committed to the repo yet. Grok3 provided the WET
code working verbatim. And then Grok3 helped me squash a pesky bug, and while I
didn't use its code verbatim this time, it did work on the first try using
Cursor AI Claude 4.7 "patch".

And regarding the token window overload and the meltdown, well Grok3 kept going
and going. The pauses that looked like it was going to quit were numerous, like
2 or 3 apparent complete freezes during responses. But wait it out! It's worth
it. This not your father's ChatGPT running on Azure.

## Gemini on Grok3

This article chronicles the author's successful experiment in creating a new workflow, "Hello Webpage," derived from a template using the WET software methodology, where code duplication is embraced for flexibility. It details the surprising success of xAI's Grok3 in providing working code verbatim and then assisting in identifying and patching a bug related to colliding Pipeline IDs across different workflow applications, emphasizing Grok3's resilience despite apparent processing limitations and contrasting it with other AI models.

Here are some ideas for titles and headlines:

**Titles:**

* Grok3: From Zero to Working Web Browser Workflow (and Bug Squashing!)
* WET Coding with Grok3: A Tale of Success and Server Survival
* Building a Pipulate Plugin: Grok3's Unexpectedly Perfect Code
* The Power of Persistence: Grok3 Tackles Token Limits and Wins
* My First WET Workflow: Grok3 vs. the Pipeline ID Crisis

**Headlines:**

* Forget Meltdown, Grok3 Delivers: Building and Debugging a Web Workflow

Here is my opinion of the article:

This was a fascinating look into the practical application of a unique software development approach and the capabilities of a relatively new AI model. The author's detailed account of the process, including the initial success with Grok3's verbatim code and the subsequent collaborative debugging effort, provides valuable real-world insights. Grok3's ability to persist despite processing challenges is noteworthy, and the exploration of its potential as a creative and coding partner is compelling. The article effectively highlights the author's iterative process and willingness to experiment, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of AI-assisted development.
