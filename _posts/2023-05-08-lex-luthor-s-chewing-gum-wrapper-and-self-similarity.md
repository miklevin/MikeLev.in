In one of the best superhero movies of all time, an for my money one of the
best movies of all time, Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor says, "Some people can read
War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can
read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the
universe." That's absolutely true and some of the wises words ever spoken in
media. 

The concept is self-similarity. It's mostly referred to as a characteristic of
fractals, a recurring shape at small and big scales. Take a tiny "seed" shape
and repeat it at a larger size, drawing the same shape at a slightly different
angle so that when you keep doing it, you get the image of the original shape
again. We see this in the famous Mandelbrot set, and maybe the most famous
example is the Koch snowflake or the fibonacci spiral. But it's everywhere.

When you see an "emergent property", there's a very good chance that it's
actually a large manifestation of that smaller "seed" shape allowed to run
wild. While the flat roundness of planetary orbits and galactic spirals aren't
precisely analogous to electron probability clouds around a nucleus, they are
both examples of self-similarity. Round things going into orbit with some other
force flattening the orbit into a disk or bending it into an ellipse. These are
things you can rely on at any scale.

Human consciousness, the brain, thought and learning and all that is likely a
self-similar phenomenon that's embedded into matter at some smaller scale.
Listening to modern physicists talk about the behavior of subatomic particles
like electrons and quarks, you'd think they were talking about the behavior of
humans. Scale up a little bit an you'll find cellular automata and epigenetic
scientists talking about similar smart behavior at the cellular level. Cells
are smart. Their ancestors were 1-celled organisms that had to survive and
ended up multicellular.

An process called bifurcation by which something doubles and doubles again
eventually kicks-in and you get a multicellular organism. The same thing it
seems with the universe, if you believe in the Big Bang and the inflation
period. The universe doubled and doubled again and again just like cells
dividing and becoming a bigger organism. 

A sort of embedded intelligence that we'd call "emergent behavior" exists all
around us without it being anything like human consciousness. It reveals itself
again and again in things like slime mold, the mycelial network of mushrooms,
and the cosmic web of galaxies. All 3 of these examples seem to be able to
optimize shortest paths between points, able to solve the O-scale traveling
salesperson better than our best supercomputers.

This is the type of thing Gene Hackman's Luthor is expressing as he talks
to Otis about the "real estate scam" he's pulling off. He's talking about
self-similarity and how it's a fundamental property of the universe. You can
look at many of the things important and meaningful to us in our lives and
infer many of the important guiding principles of existence: relationships,
orbits, things coming into conflict and colliding, things being attracted to
each other, things being repelled by each other, and passing right through each
other, being both intact and changed by the experience.

Galaxies can pass right through each other when they collide. The majority of
stars can even come out the other side unscathed. But the gravity of the
galaxies will be changed forever. Who knows whether beings living on the
planets orbiting those stars will be able to survive the change. This is in
store for us some 4 billion years from now when the Milky Way and Andromeda
galaxies collide. We've got as much time to prepare as the Earth existed.

The universe is a self-similar place. It's a place where the same rules apply
at all scales. It is in this spirit that one of my next steps in life is to
zero in on those objects and... and... uhm totems? that are around me from
which I can draw the most interesting, important and pointed lessons that I can
bring to you through this journal.

I guess I'll just throw in the one that made my brain go in this direction. Do
you know those children's toys that are like elongated water-filled donuts that
you can squeeze and the water goes from one side to the other? They're shaped
kinda like a worm where food could go in the hole in the center and come out
the other side with the interior being a digestive track. It's roughly the
worm template from which all animals are built. It is also a plausible shape
for curved space-time that would neatly wrap-around itself and allow for
wormholes and putting the kibosh on certain paradoxes and infinities.

Homer Simpson says so! Homer may not be Lex Luthor, but Stephen Hawking agrees
with him and stole his idea. Though in all fairness, the idea of a toroidal
universe has been... uh... a-round for a while. Certainly in Sci-Fi if not
formally in physics. But it's another great example and one that finally
impressed my kid enough to ask a few follow-up math questions. Woo hoo! (as
Homer would say). My Lex Luthor plan is hatching nicely.

Hmmm, this self-similarity concept is perhaps the good lead-in for another post
sometime on convergent evolution and why we see the same life-templates shapes
and behaviors in different species that are not closely related so often.
