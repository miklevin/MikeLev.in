I've got to use my public website more and to grater effect.

The power to prevent pander... LOL! I'm an SEO and taking the diametrically
opposite moral position as the field of SEO, in which we pander to what the
user wants, so we can step into their search path. Blech! It almost makes me
want to vomit. I can use my lifetime career in SEO to teach people what the
first wave of AI is going to be used against them.

AI panders to get you to stay on Facebook or whatever site and drive up the
money they're making off of you.

AI is the ultimate SEO.
