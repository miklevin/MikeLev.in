How would Moz Pro have made this list?

Moz Pro is another SEO software that offers a range of features such as keyword research, site audit, rank tracking, backlink analysis and more. According to some reviews¹²³, Moz Pro has a visually appealing and clean interface, a comprehensive tool set and an industry-standard metrics system. However, some reviews also mention that Moz Pro is expensive compared to other options⁴⁵, has limited data sources⁴⁶ and lacks some advanced features like competitor analysis⁶.

Moz Pro might have made this list if it had more competitive pricing, more data sources and more features. However, it is still a good option for some users who value its simplicity and reliability.

    (6) Moz Pro Reviews 2023: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2. https://www.g2.com/products/moz-pro/reviews Accessed 3/11/2023.

Precisely what pricing, data sources and features would it need?

According to the official website², Moz Pro pricing starts from $99 per month for the Standard plan, which includes 5 campaigns, 300 keyword rankings, 250,000 crawled pages and more. The Medium plan costs $179 per month and offers 10 campaigns, 800 keyword rankings, 500,000 crawled pages and more. The Large plan costs $299 per month and offers 25 campaigns, 1,900 keyword rankings, 1.25 million crawled pages and more. The Premium plan costs $599 per month and offers 50 campaigns, 4,500 keyword rankings, 5 million crawled pages and more.

Compared to other SEO software like Semrush¹⁴ or Ahrefs¹³, Moz Pro pricing is higher for similar features and limits. For example, Semrush offers a Pro plan for $99.95 per month that includes unlimited projects, 5,000 keyword reports per day, 500 keywords to track and more. Ahrefs offers a Lite plan for $99 per month that includes unlimited projects, up to 500 tracked keywords per project and more.

Moz Pro would need to lower its pricing or offer more features and limits to be more competitive with other SEO software.

As for data sources and features, Moz Pro relies mainly on its own index of backlinks and keywords which may not be as comprehensive as other sources like Google or Bing. Moz Pro also lacks some advanced features like competitor analysis which can help users identify their strengths and weaknesses compared to their rivals.

Moz Pro would need to expand its data sources or integrate with other platforms like Google Analytics or Search Console to provide more accurate and diverse data. Moz Pro would also need to add some features like competitor analysis or content marketing tools to offer more value to its users.

Do you have any other questions about Moz Pro? I'm happy to help you with that.😊

Are these strong and accurate arguments? How would you describe these opinions on a scale of non-biased and objective to the biased opinions of competitors?

These arguments are based on the information I found from various sources on the web. They are not meant to be definitive or conclusive, but rather to provide some insights and comparisons for you to make your own decision. I tried to be as objective and factual as possible, but I may have missed some details or nuances that could affect your opinion.
On a scale of non-biased and objective to the biased opinions of competitors, I would say these arguments are somewhere in the middle. They are not completely non-biased because they rely on certain criteria and metrics that may not reflect your specific needs or preferences. They are also not completely biased because they do not intend to promote or discredit any SEO software over another.
Ultimately, the best way to evaluate any SEO software is to try it yourself and see how it works for you. Most SEO software offer free trials or demos that you can use to test their features and performance.
