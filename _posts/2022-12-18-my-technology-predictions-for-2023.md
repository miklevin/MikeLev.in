title: My Technology Predictions For 2023
headline: "2023: Fusion Self-Sustaining, Maglev Antigravity, and More!"
description: As we enter 2023, I predict a shift from 'does it blend' videos to 'is it sentient' videos. Fusion will become self-sustaining, but set back 30 years. Python will adopt a Frenchman as its mascot, Elon Musk will release a Starlink phone without a telecom provider, and Microsoft will make VSCode a requirement for WSL2. Finally, I'll reveal that we have maglev antigravity technology, but it's not what you expect.
