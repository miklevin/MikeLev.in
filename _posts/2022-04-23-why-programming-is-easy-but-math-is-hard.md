title: Why Programming Is Easy But Math Is Hard
headline: "My Journey to Make Math Easier: Read My Blog Post and Join Me!"
description: As someone who has struggled with math since high school, I have used Python and other tools to make it easier for me. I recently created my first Jekyll blog post and am now working on adding headlines. I'm excited to share my journey and hope it helps other people who are also struggling with math. Come read my blog post and join me on this journey!

I realize I'm hyper-literal in my internalization and
application of "da rulez". High school algebra in particular limits my
capability for the sort of abstract thought required for higher mathematics.

I hit the point home with this video where I show a division operator in Python
(/) being overwritten by pathlib and the default Python slice API being
overwritten by Pandas.

If I'm going to do better practicing what I preach, I can't have these long
journal pages as my main homepages of these various sites. So, I need to think
about slice & dicing the sites... and releasing the potential of the tools I'm
using, doing as little re-invention as possible UNLESS it's absolutely called
for... in which case it wouldn't really be re-invention.

I have done a WordPress to Jekyll import (MikeLev.in) and I can look at it as
an example... but why? Go for the ideal if it exists. See how Jekyll WANTS you
to blog. Lean into the strengths of the tool.

- Keep your original data in whatever format works best for you.
  - For me, that's one long journal-like text-file (for life)
- Focus on the "transforms"
  - You can always adjust your transforms
  - You don't really even rely on Jekyll
  - Keep yourself platform-independent
- The platforms you're not independent of "always" include:
  - Linux
  - Python
  - vim
  - git

We are NOT migrating a blog. We're starting from scratch, so this page:
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/

I put a file in location to test the system.

https://pythonically.com/2022/04/23/My-First-Jekyll-Blog-Post.html

Great success.

There's much still to learn, especially about controlling that URL (categories
& tags)... but this is a "success assured" moment. All I need to do is add a
slice & dice process to my master publishing script.

Okay, wow, so I got the title logic in. Now slap some headlines on these blog
posts. A few with, a few without.
