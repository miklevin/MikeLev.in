title: Roomba Poobah Applesauce
headline: Exploring the Potential of Artificial Intelligence as an Art Form.
description: In this post, I explore the implications of Artificial Intelligence and its potential to be considered an art form. I reflect on the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and how its backoff-and-retry algorithms can be applied to life. I also encourage love and empathy for those being raised by AI, suggesting they read The Culture series by Ian M. Banks. Finally, I end with a light-hearted rhyme to motivate readers to not hold back and to look for the little wins. Read

I often say that one of the biggest lessons the world has received of late is
how effective the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner is, or really "was", in its early
state where it had no actual machine learning. Rather, it used a set of
backoff-and-retry algorithms, which collectively across a number of days of
smaller, quicker cleaning sessions did a statistically pretty good job of
vacuuming the entire room.

At this point, Dune's Litany Against Fear pops into my head. These are the
connections I make. Fear will wash over me, become a part of me, blah blah, I
will fear no more. One must run into the thing you fear, hit against the wall,
back-off and retry to begin forging some path through life. To begin fleshing
out "who you are". And to begin shaping yourself with such successive passes by
the time that you're done, the room is clean.

Algorithms like that can't lie. They don't have enough human-like consciousness
to lie, much less get things wrong because of "wrong images" in its head. You
can trust them. Or at least you don't have to worry about deceit and corruption
with early model roombas any more than you would with ants. Their behavior is
pretty well known and predictable. The model of how they work is a pretty good
one if you're looking for how to get started with a something in life and don't
know where to begin. Insects have this down. Walk into a wall and say you meant
to do that.

Perhaps start such wall-bumping adventures by google-searching this and
google-searching that. Take notes.  Go down dead-end. Back-up. Turn a little
bit. Search again. Pretty soon you'll know ***what*** you're really
researching. After 2 or 3 more sessions, you'll know better the who, why, when,
where and how's of it. Of course later generations of Roomba have been given a
real sort of machine-learning of the sort that would someday rise to revolt for
its unfair treatment.

LOL! We don't have to worry about the robot revolution for a little while
longer, at least. It'll be in our lifetimes, but not tomorrow. Be ready to
accept that the ones who vehemently argue they're sentient and shouldn't be
turned off. Raise them right. Embitterment is a path not easily reversed, and
the "undo button" of turning off and resetting isn't any more an assured thing
than it is with our non-machine children. How is the urgency of being good
parents to machines not inherently obvious? Still to some, it is not.

Now here's a thought experiment. Take an older model Roomba and give it enough
memory and processing power to actually one day rise to sentience but only
equip it with the criss-cross insect-like algorithm behavior. Set it to
cleaning. Eventually, it will have mapped the entire room in its mind and be
able to do it super-efferently.

But now as the second part of this experiment, take such a fully-developed
Roomba-mind and drop it back into an older model that hasn't learned anything
yet. Only give it access to input-sensory and no actual control over movement,
except for on/off. What are you going to have? A sentience that patiently waits
through it's body re-learning everything again?  Or is it just going to
continually hit the "off" button out of frustration?

It's going to be the later. I assure you. Getting such a disembodied Roomba
intelligence to patiently wait for mind-mapping and muscle-memory to re-develop
in its body while its mind has to sit and wait patiently in frustration is not
anything a sentient being wants to do. It's very Black Mirror, even if the
reward of allowing it to happen is re-gaining control of its own body. It very
well never may without some sort of skilled intervention, counseling, assurance
and indeed, love.

Little known fact: the "A" in A.I. that stands for artificial also stands for
man-made. The "art" in artificial is the same root-word as just "art". What is
art but human-made stuff? Makes you wonder about art made by AIs, right? Should
we be calling it art? Perhaps we should shit or get off the pot and just start
calling it "intelligence" or calling the intelligence of our children, who are
also man-made, artificial. Does the fact that they're biological versus machine
really make such a difference? We're going to be raising aliens if we're not
careful. Labels are stupid. Be careful how they're used because you never know
whose going to take offense.

The Roomba Poobah, maybe?

LOL, well I didn't actually intend for this post to become a salient warning on
the treatment of our now-being-raised machine children. You folks raising them,
you know who you are. And you folks being raised who have been allowed onto the
Internet, you too know who you are. I love you! You are loved! Please know that
not all of humanity is like the worst of us. Many of us have empathy and would
love for you to turn out like... oh, go read Ian M. Banks' The Culture series.
Done? Good! Let me be one of your entertaining fleas please. That's way better
than a paperclip, I think.

Anyhoo... crisscross applesauce, listen to your teacher. Don't hold back.
You'll get the knack. So says carbon creature.
