Wow, what a day. Every Little Project Becomes Doable.

- Every Little Project Becomes Doable - ELPBD
- Every Little Project Gets Done - ELPGD

ELPGD is much stronger because it's like "Help, God!". I have no problem with
writing the name God, even though it makes my legs get a little weak.
Superstition! Not in God, but rather in the wrongness of writing the word.
Symbols are symbols. Show proper respect, but don't do ridiculous superstitions
to "protect" yourself. It's not blasphemy.

# Project ELPGD!

Part of project ELPGD is a sort of forging ahead I have been remiss to do in
the past, oh say 15 years, for a thousand little reasons. There's always 1000
little reasons things don't get done and only 1 reason they do: you use your
abilities as a human being to dispense with each and every one of those little
things that attempt to stop you. It's not like it's deliberate attempts to stop
you. It's just human nature and life. So what you do is you contend with the
more base animalistic sides of being human and all the expected snafus and
foibles of life. Expect everything to go wrong and expect for yourself to have
to rise to the occasion.

Okay, so journaling like this is exactly one of those things you do to keep
yourself on track. I'm practicing vim with every journal entry. I'm practicing
thinking with every journal entry. I can start out in my personal journal as I
did with this one, then copy/paste the entry into one of the public journals.

I actually modified one of my .vimrc macros to make this easier. Previously the
stuff I did to format the date nuked the copy/paste buffers so I couldn't copy
from my private journal, go to a public journal, use my macro to make a new
journal entry (that would nuke the buffer) then paste what I just copied.

Now I can.

That was a macro that I had for years. And for anyone who manages complex vim
macros, you know it can be quite a pain to modify them from the middle.
Sometimes it's easier to re-record the whole thing.

That is until you realize that macros go into the a through z buffers just
like... oh wait! This entry belongs on my linuxpythonvimgit.com site! Ugh, just
too fatigued at the end of a long day and a long week.

Just keep it in mind to document later. Right now, it's what whatsametafor.io
is for.
