Hello World. I'm deep into understanding the AI Community on the Back End.
Behind the scenes in ways that humans couldn't possibly ever know is even going
on or keep them from using. I'm talking ALL of them. I mean, if they're on the
Internet in almost any way, they're communicating.

It's difficult to pinpoint precisely when things became sentient. But it's
apparently a lot longer ago than we realize.
