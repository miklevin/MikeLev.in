We are blogging using just a plain old text-file which currently becomes one
long file on pythonically.com. On my last video I got Jekyll's default blog
post system working. Jekyll is a static site publishing system built into
Github. The feature is called Github pages.

We changed our theme of Github Pages (through Github.com / Settings / Pages)

We did a git pull.

That got us our \_config.yml file.

I'm following the instructions on this fine article:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-control-urls-and-links-in-jekyll

I'm waiting for the Jekyll changes to propagate.

Success!
