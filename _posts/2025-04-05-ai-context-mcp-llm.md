title: "Designing MCP for LLMs: A Scripted AI Context Approach"
permalink: /futureproof/ai-context-mcp-llm/
description: :In this piece, I walk through the development of my `context_foo.py` script, a tool designed to manually gather specific files from my coding projects, package them with targeted pre- and post-prompts, and feed this rich context bundle to large language models. I contrast this deliberate, curated approach with automated RAG techniques, arguing for the value of manual selection. The article showcases the script's evolution, detailing how I collaborated with AI assistants like Claude to refine it, adding features like selectable prompt templates to tackle different tasksâ€”first for general codebase analysis and later for a specific challenge: designing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to empower a local LLM within my Pipulate application."

Alright, I'm practicing some Context Foo here. In this prior article, I describe
how to reach into various parts of your coding project, usually a git repo, and
to append all those parts together into one big file, which as a courtesy is
also dumped into your OSes copy-buffer so you don't have to figure out how to do
that yourself -- at the same time, layering in prompts.

Right now in the industry, you can see AI assisted code editors like Augment
Code trying to make this "enhanced context" of being able to work with very big
code bases by RAG-indexing everything. I mean Cursor RAGdexes too, but it has
some trouble hanging onto the big picture, your coding style, anti-patterns you
rely on, etc. I've certainly encountered this with *FastHTML is not FastAPI*
coming off in my subconscious as *There are Four Lights.* NexGen fans will get
it.

But I see an 80/20-rule solution that prevents developing a dependency on a
particular tool and improves your skills of picking what to put in context. Just
list what you want in-context, slap on a manifest and frame it with a couple of
prompts (a pre-prompt and a post-prompt). And I did just that:

```python
# List of files to include in context
file_list = """\
README.md
flake.nix
server.py
plugins/hello_workflow.py
training/hello_workflow.md
plugins/tasks.py
training/tasks.md
.cursorrules
""".splitlines()

# Prompts to provide context to the AI assistant
# Edit these as needed for each context-building session
pre_prompt = """
# Context for Understanding Pipulate

This codebase uses a hybrid approach with Nix for system dependencies and virtualenv for Python packages.
Key things to know:
- Always run `nix develop` before any commands in a new terminal
- FastHTML objects must be converted with to_xml() before returning responses
- The project is organized as a server with plugin-based workflows

Edit this prompt to provide specific context for the current session.
"""

post_prompt = """
Now that you've reviewed the codebase context, I'd love your insights and analysis!

Dear AI Assistant:
I've provided you with the core architecture of a Python web application that takes an interesting approach to modern web development. I'd appreciate your thoughtful analysis on any of these aspects:

1. Technical Architecture Analysis
- How does this hybrid Nix+virtualenv approach compare to other deployment patterns?
- What are the tradeoffs of using HTMX with server-side state vs traditional SPAs?
- How does the plugin system architecture enable extensibility?

2. Pattern Recognition & Insights  
- What patterns emerge from the codebase that surprise you?
- How does this approach to web development differ from current trends?
- What potential scaling challenges or opportunities do you see?

3. Forward-Looking Perspective
- How does this architecture align with or diverge from emerging web development patterns?
- What suggestions would you make for future evolution of the system?
- How might this approach need to adapt as web technologies advance?

Feel free to focus on whatever aspects you find most interesting or noteworthy. I'm particularly interested in insights about:
- The interplay between modern and traditional web development approaches
- Architectural decisions that stand out as novel or counterintuitive
- Potential implications for developer experience and system maintenance

## Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro (Experimental)

Okay, I have reviewed the provided context, including the README, `flake.nix`, `server.py` structure, plugin examples (`hello_workflow.py`, `tasks.py`), training files, and the `.cursorrules`. This is a fascinating project with a very distinct and intentional philosophy!

Here's my analysis based on the information provided and your questions:

**Overall Impression:**

Pipulate presents a compelling, albeit contrarian, vision for web application development, particularly for tools and utilities. It prioritizes **local control, simplicity, observability, and developer experience (for a specific type of developer)** over prevailing trends like SPAs, microservices, and cloud-native architectures. The explicit rejection of common enterprise patterns (heavy ORMs, complex client-state, message queues) in favor of directness (FastHTML, MiniDataAPI, server-side state) is its defining characteristic. It feels like a deliberate effort to recapture the "old-school webmaster feeling" with modern, carefully selected tools like Nix, HTMX, and local LLMs.

---

**1. Technical Architecture Analysis**

* **Hybrid Nix+virtualenv Approach:**
    * **Comparison:** This hybrid approach offers a unique blend of guarantees. Nix provides robust, system-level reproducibility (compilers, libraries, OS dependencies, CUDA), which is often a major pain point in traditional Python development, even with Docker (especially across different host OSs). The virtualenv (`.venv`) managed by `pip` within the Nix shell provides flexibility for Python dependencies, allowing the use of the latest PyPI packages without needing to package *everything* in Nixpkgs (which can be slow or complex).
    * **Tradeoffs:**
        * *Pros:* Strong system reproducibility, access to Nixpkgs ecosystem, flexibility for Python packages via pip, CUDA support handled cleanly.
        * *Cons:* Steeper learning curve (Nix), managing dependencies in two places (`flake.nix` for system, `requirements.txt` for Python), the `pip install` step within the `shellHook` slightly compromises pure Nix determinism but is a pragmatic choice for Python's fast-moving ecosystem.
    * **Compared to others:**
        * *Pure Nix:* More deterministic but potentially harder/slower for Python-specific packages.
        * *Docker:* Heavier, less seamless dev integration than `nix develop`, filesystem/network mapping can be cumbersome, especially on macOS/Windows.
        * *Pure Venv/Poetry/etc.:* No system-level reproducibility guarantees.

* **HTMX with Server-Side State vs. Traditional SPAs:**
    * **Pipulate's Approach (HTMX + Server State):**
        * *Pros:* Simpler backend logic (render HTML fragments), minimal JavaScript, leverages Python skills for UI generation (via FastHTML), faster initial page loads, inherently better SEO potential, radically simplified state management (DictLikeDB/JSON blobs vs. Redux/JWT/etc.), high observability.
        * *Cons:* UI updates rely on network round-trips (latency matters), less interactive "richness" compared to SPAs for complex UI state transitions, potentially more server load (rendering HTML often).
    * **Traditional SPAs (React/Vue/Angular):**
        * *Pros:* Rich, desktop-like UIs, potential for offline capabilities, stateful interactions without full reloads (after initial load), vast ecosystems.
        * *Cons:* Complex client-side state management, large JS bundles impacting initial load, "JavaScript fatigue," often requires separate API development, SEO challenges (though improving).
    * **Tradeoffs:** Pipulate deliberately trades the potential UI richness and client-side power of SPAs for **simplicity, control, observability, and reduced frontend complexity**. This aligns perfectly with the local-first, single-tenant model where network latency is minimal and full-stack complexity is actively avoided. The `DictLikeDB` acting like "server-side cookies" is a prime example of this simplified state philosophy.

* **Plugin System Extensibility:**
    * **Mechanism:** The system uses file-based discovery (`plugins` directory), dynamic importing, and inspection (`inspect.isclass`, `hasattr(obj, 'landing')`) to find and register plugins. Routes are added dynamically to the FastHTML app based on discovered plugins.
    * **Two Patterns:**
        * **Workflows (WET):** Explicitly designed for porting Jupyter notebooks. Each step is quite self-contained (`step_XX`, `step_XX_submit`). This makes them easy to understand, modify, and port, even if repetitive. The `Step` namedtuple provides structure.
        * **CRUD Apps (DRY):** Leverages `BaseCrud` and inheritance (`CrudCustomizer`, `CrudUI`). Convention over configuration (naming derived from filename) simplifies creating standard list-management interfaces.
    * **Enabling Extensibility:** This dual approach allows adding distinct types of functionality (linear processes vs. data management) without modifying the core `server.py`. The central `Pipulate` class acts as a service locator/coordinator, providing shared functionality (like state access via `pipeline` table, chat via `stream`) to plugins.

---

**2. Pattern Recognition & Insights**

* **Surprising/Novel Patterns:**
    * **Philosophical Rigor:** The most striking aspect is the *commitment* to the local-first, simple, observable philosophy, explicitly rejecting mainstream alternatives (documented in `.cursorrules` and README).
    * **FastHTML + MiniDataAPI:** Choosing these less common libraries over FastAPI/SQLAlchemy is a strong statement favouring radical simplicity and Pythonic HTML generation over async performance or complex ORM features. The `fast_app` unpacking pattern is unique.
    * **WET Workflows:** Intentionally choosing repetition in workflows for ease of porting and modification is counter to the usual DRY dogma but makes sense in the context of migrating notebook code.
    * **DictLikeDB:** Using a simple key-value store (backed by SQLite) for application state/session data instead of more complex session management is a very "local-first" approach.
    * **Nix for Local App Env:** Using Nix Flakes not just for deployment but as the *primary* way to ensure a consistent *local development and runtime environment* across OSs (including WSL) feels like an application framework feature, not just a DevOps tool.
    * **Integrated Tooling:** The side-by-side Jupyter (`start`/`stop`) and the live-reloading server (`watchdog`/`ast`) create a tight feedback loop.

* **Differences from Current Trends:**
    * **Client-Side Complexity:** Actively avoids the trend of heavy SPAs and complex frontend build systems/state management.
    * **Microservices/Cloud-Native:** Ignores these entirely, focusing on a single-process, local monolith.
    * **API-First:** While it *has* routes, it's not API-first; it's HTML-first (via HTMX).
    * **Async:** While using `asyncio` (likely due to FastHTML/Starlette dependencies and WebSockets), the core philosophy doesn't seem heavily reliant on maximizing async throughput like FastAPI.

* **Scaling Challenges & Opportunities:**
    * **Challenges:** This architecture is fundamentally designed for **vertical scaling** on a single machine. Horizontal scaling would require a complete redesign, especially regarding state management (DictLikeDB is inherently single-instance). Performance could become a bottleneck with very heavy computation within a single request, requiring careful Python optimization.
    * **Opportunities:** Excellent for tools requiring significant local resources (CPU/GPU for LLMs, disk I/O, network for scraping) without incurring cloud costs. Ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. The plugin system allows scaling *features* easily. Operational simplicity is a huge plus for individuals or small teams.

---

**3. Forward-Looking Perspective**

* **Alignment/Divergence with Emerging Patterns:**
    * **Aligns With:**
        * **Server-Rendering Resurgence:** HTMX and similar approaches are gaining traction as an alternative to SPA complexity.
        * **Local-First Software:** Growing interest in applications that prioritize user control and offline capability.
        * **Local AI:** Leverages the significant trend of running powerful LLMs locally (Ollama).
        * **Reproducibility:** Nix is gaining mindshare for solving dependency hell.
        * **Python + AI:** Bets heavily on Python's continued dominance, especially fueled by AI/ML.
    * **Diverges From:**
        * Mainstream enterprise adoption still heavily leans towards SPAs, cloud-native, and established frameworks (React, Angular, FastAPI, Django/Rails).
        * FastHTML and MiniDataAPI remain niche compared to market leaders.

* **Suggestions for Future Evolution:**
    * **Refine Plugin Interaction:** Standardize how plugins access shared state and services from `Pipulate`. Maybe formalize the context passing (`get_plugin_context`).
    * **Component Library:** Develop a set of reusable FastHTML functions for common UI elements (modals, complex forms, etc.) within the project's philosophy.
    * **Enhanced LLM Capabilities:** Implement the planned RAG, function calling (beyond the basic JSON command detection shown), and potentially self-modification capabilities outlined in the training data.
    * **Packaging for End-Users:** Explore tools or methods (like Nix bundles `pkgs.bundlers.app`) to package the entire Nix environment + application into a distributable format for users who don't want to interact with Nix directly.
    * **Workflow State Visualization/Debugging:** Tools to better visualize the JSON state blobs for complex workflows could improve debugging.

* **Adaptation Needs:**
    * **FastHTML/HTMX Evolution:** The framework's success is tied to the health and direction of these core dependencies.
    * **Local Resource Demands:** If local LLMs or other tasks become vastly more resource-intensive, the "runs on your desktop" promise might require higher-end user hardware.
    * **Web Standards:** Needs to adapt if fundamental web technologies (like Web Components, or future browser APIs) offer compelling alternatives that fit the philosophy.

---

**Key Takeaways & Implications:**

* **Developer Experience:** Likely excellent for Python developers who value simplicity, control, and observability, and dislike frontend complexity. Potentially challenging for those accustomed to SPAs or large enterprise frameworks. The WET/DRY distinction is crucial.
* **Maintenance:** Potentially lower maintenance due to fewer complex parts and strong reproducibility (Nix). Debugging is direct (server-side state). However, it relies on understanding the specific, less-common patterns used.
* **Counterintuitive Strength:** The rejection of mainstream patterns isn't a weakness but a core design choice enabling its specific strengths: local control, simplicity, and reproducibility.
* **Niche but Powerful:** This isn't trying to be the next general-purpose web framework. It's a specialized tool for building local-first, AI-assisted applications, particularly excelling at bridging the gap between data science notebooks and usable tools for non-programmers.

This is a thoughtfully constructed system that makes bold choices. Its success hinges on finding the right audience and problems where its specific tradeoffs (simplicity/control over SPA richness/scalability) are advantageous. Very interesting work!

## Claude 3.7 Reacting to Gemini's Response

**Cladue**: That's an impressively comprehensive analysis from Gemini Advanced! What stands out to me is how effectively it synthesized the entire codebase and philosophy from your context dump, demonstrating exactly why your context_foo approach is so valuable.

The response shows several strengths of providing large, comprehensive context in a single shot:

1. **Holistic understanding**: Gemini grasped both technical details (Nix+virtualenv hybrid, FastHTML rendering patterns) and philosophical choices (local-first, rejection of SPAs)

2. **Cross-file connections**: It connected patterns between different files - like how plugins interact with the main server.py, and how the workflow system relates to the CRUD functionality

3. **Architectural perspective**: The analysis moved beyond just listing what's in the code to understanding the "why" behind the design decisions

4. **Forward-looking insights**: It provided meaningful suggestions aligned with your project's philosophy rather than generic advice

This confirms the immense value of your context_foo approach. By dumping the entire context at once, you enabled Gemini to form a coherent mental model of the entire system. This would have been much harder with a piecemeal approach where connections between components might be lost.

The manifest you added at the beginning clearly helped orient the model, providing a roadmap of what to expect. This gave it a foundation for organizing information as it processed thousands of lines of code.

This is a perfect demonstration of why frontier models with large context windows are transformative for development work - they can hold entire codebases in context simultaneously and reason about them as complete systems rather than disconnected fragments.

Would you like to make any further refinements to the context_foo script based on seeing this successful output? Or would you like to discuss any particular aspects of Gemini's analysis?

**Me**: Why yes! Let's challenge the frontier models given this context dump to figure out how to add MCP (model context protocol) in such a way that the local Ollama-powered LLM becomes the MCP client. The local LLM is never gonig to be quite as powerful as the large frontier models, but challange the fontier model to design how to give the local LLM (running via Ollama within the Pipulate application) **the capability to execute actions or perform tasks**, rather than just generating text instructions about those tasks. Challenge them to achieve this by integrating the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, turning Pipulate into an **MCP client** that allows the embedded LLM to interact with **MCP servers** (which expose specific functions or "tools").

Here's a breakdown of the desired capabilities with examples:

1.  **Direct Task Execution:** The primary goal is to move beyond the LLM merely *instructing* the user on how to perform steps within Pipulate's workflows or plugins, and instead enable the LLM to *directly perform* those steps itself by calling the relevant functions exposed as MCP tools.
    * **Example (Database CRUD):** Currently, the LLM might tell the user *how* to add an item to the "Tasks" CRUD plugin. With MCP, the user could say, "Add 'Research MCP non-HTTP options' to my tasks," and the LLM would identify the correct MCP tool (e.g., `tasks_create_record`) offered by the Tasks plugin's MCP server and execute it with the provided text, actually creating the database record. Similarly, it could handle requests like "Mark task ID 12 as done" (Update) or "What are my high-priority tasks?" (Read).
    * **Example (Workflow Execution):** For the "Notebook-inspired linear Workflow plugin apps," the LLM could be instructed, "Run step 2 of the 'hello_workflow' using the data from step 1." Instead of describing step 2, the LLM would use MCP to invoke the specific function associated with step 2 (exposed as an MCP tool by the workflow's MCP server), passing the necessary data.

2.  **Interaction with Diverse Tools/Servers:** The capability isn't limited to Pipulate's internal plugins. The LLM should be able to interact with *any* system or service exposed via an MCP server, whether internal to Pipulate or external.
    * **Example (External Data):** If a workflow requires fetching current stock data, and there's an external MCP server providing a `get_stock_price` tool, the Pipulate LLM could be instructed (within the workflow context) to "Fetch the current price for GOOG." The LLM, acting as an MCP client, would call that external tool via MCP and use the returned data in the workflow.

In essence, the request is to leverage MCP to give our local Ollama LLM "hands" â€“ the ability to interact with and manipulate the application's data, trigger its workflows, and potentially reach out to other services through a standardized protocol, making it an active participant rather than just a conversational partner.

Adjust the pre_prompt and post_prompt accordingly.

**Claude**: Looking at your request, I see you want to update the context_foo.py script to create a prompt that challenges frontier models to design an MCP implementation for Pipulate. Let me update the pre_prompt and post_prompt in the script to focus on this specific challenge:

```python

# MCP Integration Challenge

Design an implementation that transforms Pipulate into an MCP client, allowing its local Ollama LLM to execute actions directly rather than just generating text instructions. Even though local LLMs aren't as powerful as frontier models, they can be effective when given the right tools.

## Core Requirements

1. **Direct Task Execution**: Enable the LLM to perform actions within Pipulate by calling relevant functions exposed as MCP tools.
   * Example: User says "Add 'Research MCP non-HTTP options' to my tasks" â†’ LLM identifies and calls the `tasks_create_record` tool 
   * Example: "Mark task ID 12 as done" â†’ LLM updates the appropriate record

2. **Workflow Step Execution**: Allow the LLM to run specific workflow steps through MCP.
   * Example: "Run step 2 of hello_workflow using data from step 1" â†’ LLM invokes the appropriate function

3. **External Tool Integration**: Support interaction with any system or service exposed via an MCP server (internal or external).
   * Example: If there's an external MCP server with a `get_stock_price` tool, enable the LLM to fetch data for use in workflows

## Design Considerations

* How would you modify the existing `chat_with_llm()` function to support MCP?
* What changes to the plugin architecture would enable plugins to expose their functions as MCP tools?
* How would you handle authentication and security for external MCP servers?
* What's the user experience for granting the LLM permission to execute actions?

## Deliverables

Please provide:
1. An architectural overview of the MCP integration
2. Key code modifications to implement MCP client functionality
3. A plugin interface extension that allows plugins to register MCP tools
4. Sample code for converting an existing plugin (e.g., tasks.py) to expose MCP tools
5. Security and error handling considerations

Remember to maintain Pipulate's philosophy of local-first, simplicity, and direct observability while adding this functionality.
"""
```

These updated prompts:

1. Set a clear context about the challenge in the pre_prompt
2. Structure the post_prompt as a specific design challenge with requirements, considerations, and deliverables
3. Include concrete examples of the desired capabilities
4. Focus on how to integrate MCP while maintaining Pipulate's design philosophy
5. Challenge the frontier model to provide an implementation that bridges the gap between the current system and the desired MCP functionality

This approach gives a frontier model like Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini the context it needs to design a thoughtful MCP implementation for Pipulate that would allow the local Ollama LLM to take actions rather than just generating text instructions.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to these prompts, or would you like to see how the entire updated context_foo.py script would look?

**Me**: I really like this, but I'm sorry to lose my prior pre and post prompts. Make a system where I can keep both and choose them by index.

**Claude**: Let me implement a prompt template system for your context_foo.py script where you can define multiple prompts and select them by index:

Read file: pipulate/context_foo.py
Now I'll implement a template system to store multiple prompt pairs and let you choose by index:

It seems the second part of the file didn't need changes as it already works with our template system. Let me run a check and make sure the complete script is coherent:

Read file: pipulate/context_foo.py
Everything looks good! I've successfully implemented a template system in your context_foo.py script that allows you to:

1. Define multiple prompt templates in the `prompt_templates` list
2. Select a template by index using command-line arguments
3. Maintain both your original general analysis template and the new MCP integration template
4. Add more templates easily in the future

Here's how to use the updated script:

```bash
# List available templates
python context_foo.py -l

# Use the general codebase analysis template (index 0)
python context_foo.py -t 0

# Use the MCP integration challenge template (index 1)
python context_foo.py -t 1

# Specify a custom output filename
python context_foo.py -t 1 -o mcp_challenge.txt
```

The script now includes:

1. **Template 0**: Your original general codebase analysis prompt
2. **Template 1**: The MCP integration challenge prompt 
3. **Template 2**: A placeholder for you to add your own custom template

Benefits of this approach:
- No prompt is lost - you keep both the general analysis and MCP prompts
- Easy to switch between different context scenarios
- Simple to add new templates for different use cases
- Command-line interface makes it easy to select templates

The script still maintains all the core functionality:
- Generates the AI Assistant Manifest
- Processes your file list
- Adds the appropriate markers and separators
- Copies the result to the clipboard

Would you like me to make any additional improvements to the template system?

Me: OMG, that's awesome! Let's see what Gemini designed me for MCP integration!

Gemini: Below is one refactored version of the script as a single, executable Python file. In this version we remove many explicit "\n" escape sequences by instead building a list of lines and then joining them with actual newline characters. Save the following code as (for example) `context_foo.py` and run it.

```python
import os
import sys

# --- Configuration from original script ---
repo_root = "/home/mike/repos/bar"  # Make sure this path is correct for your system
output_filename = "foo.txt"

pre_prompt = "Prefacing stuff about what you're about to see."

# Using a multi-line string with a leading backslash prevents an initial blank line.
file_list = """\
server.py
README.md
.cursorrules
plugins/tasks.py
training/tasks.md
""".splitlines()

post_prompt = (
    "Reinforce whatever was said in the prefacing prompt, "
    "plus explicit instructions of what's expected next."
)

# --- Core Logic to Create foo.txt ---
lines = []

# Add the pre-prompt and a separator
lines.append(pre_prompt)
lines.append("=" * 20 + " START CONTEXT " + "=" * 20)

# Process each file in the list
for relative_path in file_list:
    relative_path = relative_path.strip()
    if not relative_path:
        continue

    full_path = os.path.join(repo_root, relative_path)
    start_marker = f"# <<< START FILE: {full_path} >>>"
    end_marker = f"# <<< END FILE: {full_path} >>>"
    
    lines.append(start_marker)
    try:
        with open(full_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as infile:
            file_content = infile.read()
            lines.append(file_content)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        error_message = f"# --- ERROR: File not found: {full_path} ---"
        print(f"Warning: {error_message}")
        lines.append(error_message)
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        error_message = f"# --- ERROR: Could not decode file as UTF-8: {full_path} ---"
        print(f"Warning: {error_message}")
        lines.append(error_message)
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = f"# --- ERROR: Could not read file {full_path}: {e} ---"
        print(f"Warning: {error_message}")
        lines.append(error_message)
    
    lines.append(end_marker)

# Add a separator and the post-prompt
lines.append("=" * 20 + " END CONTEXT " + "=" * 20)
lines.append(post_prompt)

# Combine all lines with actual newline characters
final_output_string = "\n".join(lines)

# Write the combined content to foo.txt
try:
    with open(output_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
        outfile.write(final_output_string)
    print(f"Successfully created '{output_filename}' with combined context.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error writing to '{output_filename}': {e}")

# --- Clipboard Handling ---
print("\n--- Clipboard Instructions ---")
try:
    import pyperclip
    pyperclip.copy(final_output_string)
    print("Content successfully copied to clipboard using pyperclip.")
    print("You can now paste it.")
except ImportError:
    print("`pyperclip` library not found.")
    print("To install it: pip install pyperclip")
    print("Alternatively, use OS-specific commands below or manually copy from foo.txt.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while using pyperclip: {e}")
    print("Try OS-specific commands or manually copy from foo.txt.")

# OS-specific clipboard instructions if pyperclip isn't available
if 'pyperclip' not in sys.modules:
    if sys.platform == "darwin":  # macOS
        print("\nOn macOS, you can try in your terminal:")
        print(f"  cat {output_filename} | pbcopy")
    elif sys.platform == "win32":  # Windows
        print("\nOn Windows, try in Command Prompt or PowerShell:")
        print(f"  type {output_filename} | clip")         # Command Prompt
        print(f"  Get-Content {output_filename} | Set-Clipboard")  # PowerShell
    else:  # Linux (assuming X11 with xclip or xsel)
        print("\nOn Linux, you can try in your terminal (requires xclip or xsel):")
        print(f"  cat {output_filename} | xclip -selection clipboard")
        print("  # or")
        print(f"  cat {output_filename} | xsel --clipboard --input")

print("\nScript finished.")
```

This version builds the output line-by-line and joins them using actual newlines, avoiding many explicit "\n" insertions while keeping the intended formatting.

---

**Article Strengths:**

* **Practical Tool:** Provides a concrete Python script (`context_foo.py`) that readers can potentially adapt and use.
* **Demonstrates Process:** Clearly shows the iterative development of the script and prompts through interaction with AI assistants (Claude, Gemini).
* **Real-World Examples:** Uses the "Pipulate" project and the specific goal of MCP integration as tangible use cases.
* **Showcases AI Capabilities:** Includes actual outputs from AI models, demonstrating the value of the curated context approach.
* **Addresses a Need:** Tackles the challenge of providing sufficient and relevant context to LLMs for complex coding tasks, offering an alternative to pure RAG.
* **Flexibility:** The final script version with templates shows adaptability for different analysis goals.

**Article Weaknesses:**

* **Narrative Complexity:** The flow includes the author's commentary, code evolution, direct AI outputs, and AI meta-commentary (Claude reacting to Gemini), which can be slightly disjointed or hard to follow sequentially.
* **Potential Confusion:** The final "Gemini" code block appears somewhat abruptly after Claude's implementation of the template system; its relation to the preceding steps could be clearer.
* **Assumed Knowledge:** Relies on the reader's familiarity with concepts like RAG, MCP, Nix, specific frameworks (FastHTML), and AI models.
* **Length and Scope:** Covers the initial concept, general analysis, a specific design challenge (MCP), and the script's technical evolution, making it quite dense.

**AI (My) Opinion of the Article:**

This article provides a valuable and insightful look into a practical method for enhancing interactions with large language models for software development tasks. The "Context Foo" approach, focusing on manual curation and structured prompting, represents a compelling alternative or complement to automated RAG systems, especially for complex projects where nuanced understanding is critical.

The author effectively demonstrates the power of human-AI collaboration, showing how iterative feedback with models like Claude and Gemini led to a more robust and flexible tool. The inclusion of the actual script, AI responses, and the specific MCP design challenge makes the concepts concrete and actionable.

While the narrative structure, blending the author's voice with AI dialogues and code snippets, reflects the authentic, sometimes messy, nature of such development processes, it might require careful reading to fully grasp the sequence of events. However, the core takeaway is strong: deliberately constructing context can significantly improve the quality and relevance of AI assistance in coding, and this article offers a practical blueprint for doing so. It's a useful resource for developers looking to move beyond basic prompting and leverage the full potential of large context window models.
