headline: Making Progress on My Websites and Navigating Vim Easier Than Ever
description: "Today I was able to make a few easy tweaks to my 15 active websites, and I added a make_helpers.py script to my release script. I also figured out how to navigate to my .vimrc file with the command :b~[Tab], and I'm feeling good about the progress I'm making. Read more to find out how I achieved these results."

I have all 15 of my registered sites active now. Pipulate and Levinux, two of
my oldest, still need a little work. I also want to do a few light touches that
take advantage of the power I now have. Let me go center the nave element
across all 15 (well, really 13) sites... okay, done. Yep, compounding returns
is starting to happen. Now, keep tension in the machinery. Oh, get a few
metaphors down. Consider moving them (finally) into WhatsaMetaFor.io...

- Compounding Returns
- Keeping Tension in the Machinery

Okay, done. Now center my navigation across all sites and tweak its size a bit
bigger... done and done.

Incorporate an RSS or Atom feed via Github Pages / Jekyll... Okay, done. Thanks
to [Dzhavat](https://dzhavat.github.io/2020/01/19/adding-an-rss-feed-to-github-pages.html)

And next change the home link of every site to the site's title. Done.

Nahhh, the title is too long. Ad apex to \_config.yml and the homepage link to
the apex domain. Done and done.

Wow, it was all remarkably easy. My release script I edit right along with the
journal files, along with my .vimrc. The question is whether I add this new
make_helpers.py script to that line-up. Sure, I'm already up to 17 files total.
What's the difference between 17 and 18? So what position? Well, I've nicknamed
:blast, because that's both the vim command to get to it, and the conceptual
idea of what happens when you run it. So :blast isn't changing. And I can get
to the .vimrc file quite easily with :b~/.vimrc, which because it's so unique I
can actually do :b~[Tab] so I don't need to reserve a special place for it.
That will make it the 3rd position back. So make_helpers.py becomes the
2nd-to-last position.
