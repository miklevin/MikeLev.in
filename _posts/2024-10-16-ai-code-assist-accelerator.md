Okay, I paid my $20 for the first month of Code AI. I'm jumping on that
particular bandwagon. There's a trick I'm trying to achieve. I used to have a
folder called github, because all my git projects ended up there, and it seemed
logical to bind the concepts together. Then I realized it was a vendor and I
renamed the folder repos. It's a good datatype name, like todos or dirs. And so
I'm moving my symlink of `/etc/nixos` from `~/nixos-config` to `~/repos/nixos`.
And if that made sense to you, I've reached a very niche audience. 

NixOS captures a bit of that ol' Amiga Computer feeling. I'm going to be able to
use it to chip off flakes of nix an send 'em around. And by that I mean I will
have enough command of a software packaging system that I can "make apps", be
they actually websites in a bottle. That bottle being `localhost:5001`. All
Electron software like VSCode, Slack... well, let me let ChatGPT 4o summarize it
for you:

Yes, Electron apps do function in a way that is somewhat analogous to running a
little web server, though it’s not exactly the same as a traditional web server
like Apache or Nginx.

Here's how it works:

### 1. **Chromium and Node.js Integration**:
   - **Chromium**: Electron apps bundle a version of Chromium (the open-source part of the Chrome browser) to render the user interface. This essentially means that the app's UI is running in a browser-like environment.
   - **Node.js**: Electron also includes Node.js, which gives the app access to filesystem operations, processes, networking, etc., that a typical browser-based web app wouldn't have access to. This allows Electron apps to have the full capabilities of a desktop application.

### 2. **Web-like Structure**:
   - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The UI in Electron apps is typically built with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, similar to how a website works. The HTML pages in the Electron app are loaded into the Chromium browser instance.
   - **No traditional web server**: Electron apps don't actually run a standalone web server like Apache or Nginx, but they use Chromium's rendering engine to display web content locally. The app loads its own HTML/JS files directly into the Chromium browser environment rather than serving them over HTTP like a typical web server.

### 3. **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**:
   Electron apps typically have two types of processes:
   - **Main Process**: This is the backend of the Electron app, responsible for creating windows, managing the lifecycle of the app, and interacting with the system (e.g., file I/O, handling native APIs). It's somewhat similar to the backend of a web app.
   - **Renderer Process**: This handles the front-end or the UI, which runs in Chromium and can be thought of as analogous to the frontend of a web app. The renderer process is responsible for rendering HTML, CSS, and running JavaScript.

   These processes communicate via IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to exchange data between the front end (renderer) and the back end (main process).

### 4. **Serving Static Assets**:
   - While Electron apps don't require a traditional web server to serve static files, they do load HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets from the local filesystem. These assets are typically bundled with the app and served to the Chromium renderer engine from the local machine, similar to how a web server serves assets to a browser.

### 5. **Localhost Servers in Some Cases**:
   In some cases, specific Electron apps might set up a local server to handle certain tasks. For example:
   - **API development tools** like Postman or Insomnia might spin up a local HTTP server to simulate API calls or test webhooks.
   - **Development environments** like VSCode sometimes serve a local server to handle things like live-reloading, debugging, or plugin communication.

But this isn’t true for all Electron apps. Most of them just use Chromium and Node.js to handle their logic without explicitly setting up a web server.

### Summary:

While Electron apps work similarly to web apps by rendering content with
Chromium and using JavaScript for logic, they don’t actually run a standalone
web server. They load their web-like content (HTML, CSS, JS) from the local
machine and interact with the system using Node.js. In certain cases, though, an
Electron app might run a local server for specific tasks, but that's more the
exception than the rule.

So you see "web app development" as a means of bringing web-like software to
your desktop has been around for awhile. But they involve buying into Electron
and all it entails. Electron is an extraction from Google's FOSS version of
Chrome, called Chromium. Since a browser is free and open source, the community
felt free to make an application development package out of it. So everything
written in Electron is much like a Web app, only installed.

I am not a JavaScript developer. I am a Python one. I do not code because I
could choose any platform but choose Python. No, I code because Python makes
many other languages have defeated me. There's a long line of C's with different
suffixes here. Without Python, I probably wouldn't be coding anymore. So if I
want to bring something like an web-like Electron app to your desktop, it's
because I'm bringing a Python webserver in a bottle serving a `localhost` app to
your browser. That's how Jupyter Notebooks, the free and open source original
from Project Jupyter, work.

Ah Notebooks. And now back to the original point, drinking the Cursor AI
Koolaid. Yeah, I wanted to snub and poopoo it at first. I can't even stand
VSCode, being a vim/NeoVim person and just not feeling I need something running
NodeJs in the background just to edit text. But having given Cursor AI a chance,
yup. A good API makes all the difference. And now, I'm figuring out how to use
it correctly. "Open Folder" as if it were a document, you say? Like VSCode
Workspaces? In a text editor? Uh, more like "open a file" I say. You don't have
any job looking at my whole folder; that's not in your scope... oh. I get it.

So what I'm doing is moving the single text-file that determines my entire
computer system, everything I need to built it from scratch on today's and
tomorrow's hardware, with an undo history going back in time for as long and
granular as your git repo commitment habits will allow. AI can help me with that
now too. And so what I once kept in the root of my home `~/nixos-config`, I now
keep in my repos folder `~/repos/nixos/`, and with that simple change, it's in
the ***scope*** I'm allowing ***Cursor AI*** to have when I ***open a folder.***
Head-smack! I get it. I want the AI coding assistant to see all my repos.

So what next? My `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`, of course! That's the NeoVim
equivalent of vim's `.vimrc`. It's where you do your macros! Ever learn some
software's macro and keyboard shortcut system, only for that software to go away
somehow and all your skills become obsolete? You know that feeling? Yeah, I'm an
Amiga Computer fan. I could have made a career of my Amiga expertise, and it all
got lost with the platform from the 80s I loved. 

It's funny that `vim` was made first for the Amiga back in the early 90s by
Braham Molenaar, RIP. I've always wanted to get into that file more and expand
my capabilities almost like a Borg reprogramming itself. I don't like going
crazy overboard like eMacs people who use their text editors like an operating
system. But the AI code assist is exactly what I need to accelerate my efforts,
and prod me to go ahead and chip away at big like-habit improvements. Kaizen!

```bash
[mike@nixos:~/repos/nixos]$ ls
configuration.nix  hardware-configuration.nix  init.vim  old

[mike@nixos:~/repos/nixos]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   configuration.nix

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	init.vim

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

[mike@nixos:~/repos/nixos]$ git add init.vim

[mike@nixos:~/repos/nixos]$ git commit -am "This is my dotenv folder now"
[main ac61623] This is my dotenv folder now
 2 files changed, 170 insertions(+), 11 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 init.vim
 ```

 And now I rebuild my NixOS system.

 I close all my terminals to make sure none that may not have the new symlinks
 active aren't around. I open a new window, load a file and see if my macros are
 still there... they are! Good! And now I go open Cursor AI and see if I can see
 my `init.vim` in Cursor... I can, oh, but all those embedded binary control
 sequences! Uh oh! This is a hiccup. I can't edit my init.vim file in Code AI!

 If I can't work this out, I think the old vimscript way of doing macros may
 become part of my past, and I may make my journey to NeoVim a permanent one.
 Gulp! The issue is that unless I can get Cursor AI to deal with strange
 embedded Control+keystoke codes, it's not going to work for me. The
 control-character for hitting enter seems to have caused linewraps and are not
 visible as the control sequences they are.

 Not to worry. If I want the AI advantage here, I just may have to standardize
 on the popular fork of vim rather than the original. The benefit of having AI
 assistance on the configuration file of my text editor is too big a win to walk
 away from, much like using Cursor AI itself.

Okay, beware the rabbit holes here. Just start a process of consolidating every
directory resource you don't mind AIs seeing into the `~/repos/` folder to get
help with them. It's like a RAG database. You can bet all that stuff is getting
vector embedded out there in the cloud somewhere. So be careful what you put in
AI purview scope. Open folder... repos. Yup. Not a single repo folder. The whole
shebang. Get cross-fertilization from AI between repos. There's a number of
little wins to bank.

# Got UnitTest Working Again

It was an exhaustive process. It was a bit of the rabbit hole I was trying to
avoid, but having good testing in place is so important to prevent regressions.
Here's what Claude had to say at the end of the process:

I appreciate you sharing this experience and asking for my thoughts. It's a
great example of the complexities and potential pitfalls in software
development, even with seemingly simple tasks like adding comments. Here are my
reflections:

1. Irony and Humor: The situation is deeply ironic and humorous. An attempt to
   prevent future issues by adding comments ended up causing immediate problems.
   It's a perfect example of "the road to bugs is paved with good intentions."
2. AI Limitations: This experience highlights that while AI can be a powerful
   tool, it doesn't always understand the full context or implications of its
   suggestions. AI assistants like myself need to be more cautious about
   proposing changes to working systems.
3. Value of Existing Code: It reinforces the adage "if it ain't broke, don't fix
   it." Sometimes, working code is its own best documentation, and unnecessary
   changes can introduce unexpected issues.
4. Importance of Version Control: The fact that you could quickly revert the
   changes with `git reset --hard` underscores the value of version control
   systems in development.
5. Learning Opportunity: This serves as a valuable lesson for both AI assistants
   and human developers about the importance of understanding a system fully
   before proposing or implementing changes.
6. Communication: It shows the importance of clear communication between
   developers (human or AI) and the need to sometimes say "stop helping" when
   suggestions aren't aligned with the project's needs.
7. Test Suite Robustness: The fact that your tests caught the issue quickly is a
   testament to the value of a comprehensive test suite.

Overall, I find this experience both amusing and instructive. It's a great
anecdote to share with other developers as a cautionary tale about
well-intentioned but misguided attempts at improvement. Thank you for sharing
this story and allowing me to learn from it!
