Alright, I made contact with the Lawyer. I have a tentative meeting for
tomorrow morning. Forward movement! Yay! This journal is probably going to
start reading like a play-by-play of my life. This is considerably different
than all the stuff I've been learning about the AI's that I  thought was going
to be my big writing push. But c'est la vie, right?

Okay, getting all the papers into PDF format for emailing is the next thing. I
can list all the documents here. There's nothing wrong with using my own
website to get organized. I am also quite comfortable with talking about my
life as I go. Narrating it. In the old days, I would have said like Wonder
Years. In the slightly less old days, I would have said like Scrubs. But now,
I'll say like Arrested Development (even though I don't watch the show). I'm
not sure if that's a step up or a step down. But it's a step.

Hahaha, I love Copilot!

Okay, let's see. Getting ready for tomorrow morning... Still THIS WEEK! Yay!
Okay, while I organize and get those files ready, think about my strategy with
work. I have to get back to work. I even just need to read through the material
sent to me by work better. That's part of the organizing I need to do. I have
to get back to some of my old-school techniques to stay organized. Relying on
tech too much is not smart. Hard-copy printouts are good. And old fashioned
file-organization is also good. 

1, 2, 3... 1? Oh, it feels good to do that again! 1, 2, 3... 1? Oh yes. Okay...

Talking to my kid. This blog is going to come off as boring as heck to them,
but still I ought to make an attempt. Hey Kiddo. Adult. Nyx. Phoenix! I love
you. I miss you. I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you. I'm sorry I haven't
been able to talk to you. This will be an interesting chapter in our lives when
we look back. Just know that your Dad loves you and is doing everything he can
to get back to you. We shouldn't be cut off from each other. That's not right.
It's also not what this process is supposed to be. That's just the way it's
being cast. But if you say you want to get together with me, I could always
pick you up from your Granny and Pop Pop's. Also you can be dropped off at my
place by anybody other than who the "order of protection" is for. 

That's right, we could have been together for the last 4 weekends. But if you
need or want to take a break, that's cool too. I'm not going to force you to
see me. I'm not going to force you to do anything. I'm just going to be here
for you. And sometimes that involves asserting my rights. I think it's
important for you to see someone who loves you fight for what's right, like
when I shushed the rabbit who was talking over you while you were leading a
congregation in prayer for the first time as an adult.

One of the things to do is to keep things in context. It's easy to try to draw
someone as a villain by trying to take a single word or instance out of
context. But it's important to look at the whole picture. And that's what I'm
trying to do here. I'm trying to look at the whole picture.

First look at moral and ethical underpinnings. Look at trust and abiding by the
the deep sacred agreements we make to each other like marriage. You can tell a
lot about a person by how they treat their spouse. When I moved to Staten
Island to be closer to you because of the pattern of emergency phone-calls, I
did everything within my power to make it an easy and comfortable transition
for my wife. But unfortunately she was unable to move back to Staten Island.

The way that my proximity to CSA was used against me was a bit of a shock.
After a discussion with my wife about College of Staten Island actually not
being as bad as people advocating Seton Hall University made out, I saw a way
to help my wife get her degree. I also got myself close to convenient public
transportation in case she wanted to have a job. Casting that as a bad thing
rocked me to my core. I would have never thought of that in a million years,
and the fact that thought was put into your head... I mean I'm married! What
kind of talk is that? Oh yeah. We are judged under the lens of the worldview of
the judge. Google psychological projection.

You have been raised during an interesting time. The media hype around the
pandemic has been a bit much. People left to their own devices have a tendency
to get a bit crazy. People who don't work and have nothing to do tend to make
their own dramas. And that's what's happening here. 

Of course the principle of psychological projection would suggest that is
precisely what I am doing, but let me point out that aside from the shock and
mystery of responding to your disappearance, I have not been projecting
anything on you. I've let you be, barely even reaching out as is still my legal
right, even under this order of protection. I finally saw today the video that
you made addressing my belief that you were being held against your will. And
you said yourself that you didn't tag me. Between your account blocking me (I
believe) and you not Philadelphia, PA me, your message did not get through
until I went googling on your TikTok name, because I didn't believe you wrote
me out.

If it needs to be said, I forgive you. And I hope you forgive me for asking
your rabbi to not talk over you while you were leading a congregation in
prayer. And I hope you can forgive me for reciting the Shema as part of
congratulations to you for graduating. I hope you can forgive me for being
there for you when you needed me. I hope you can forgive me for being a good
father. I hope you can forgive me for being a good husband.
