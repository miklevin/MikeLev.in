Ugh, it's weeks later and I still haven't ported the 2 key apps. But that's
okay. I do it tonight. I go late and long if I have to. And tomorrow, I have my
first client call that I'm managing myself in a long while. So I can do both
things without screwing up, right? Right!

Everything becomes easier as you get more adept at AI-wrangling, right? It's
just like being an SEO or Webmaster before it. There are no hard and fast rules.
Some people might think so or try to tell you so, usually to make money off of

bear every day. Let the word and the wonder spread of this new thing, this way
Mike works that is just... just... well, words ***should*** fail.

And that's why the port is going to be fun. I'm going to blast through it the
best and as fast as I can. We're talking a few hours, as opposed to the few
weeks it took me to get this far. 1, 2, 3... 1? ...is how it goes. That's the
language I use. I'm always on step #1, because you can't do anything more that
what's immediately before you. The now-moment is everything... and now... and
now... methinks App #1 in the app placeholder section is
