description: 30 years ago today, my father Charles Levin passed away. I remember the Amiga computer dying and my mother's mental health declining, as well as my sister and her friend moving in. I was forced to take over my father's check cashing store and in the process, a man attempted to rob me and I shot him four times. I was charged for a crime and my career plans were ruined. I learned from my father not to take the advice of his uncles.

Today is the 30th anniversary of my father's death, Charles Levin, June 8th, 1992.
The Amiga computer died. Dad died. Early signs of my mother going crazy
were setting in, and my perpetually angry sister and her crazy friend Trava
that she brought with her from California moved in on me, being in town for my
graduation and suddenly with no signs of leaving. I had to take over my dad's
check cashing store, because ostensibly, it was all he had to leave my sister
and me and as executor of the estate, I was legally bound to preserve the
assets.

And in the course of running that check cashing store, a man tries to
rob me and I shoot him four times with a gun I didn't yet have a license to
carry. I'm charged for a crime myself and quickly released, but my "career"
coming out of college with stars in my eyes being the kid beamed up to the
Commodore mother ship came crashing down around me. Meanwhile, a snot-nosed
neighbor I had a childhood rivalry with shoots onto the Forbes 40 under 40
list. And why do I even care? The idea of being him is reprehensible. So what
do I want? And why do I even write this?

Well, I write this because it's been thirty years since Dad's death, and it
honors his memory for what it's worth to remember him, and maybe does some good
for me. I was twenty-one. I'm now fifty-one. Thirty-one and forty-one came
in-between. Where was I then? Was I keeping a journal like now? Forget about
what I would have done differently. What do I know now that I would have liked
to have known then? What gifts can I give to my child based on the advantage of
years and having experienced a thing or two?

Easy! Listen more closely to your own internal voice than to the voices of
others, pop-culture, expectations of parents, or even your teachers, college
professors, heroes or whoever. There's a voice deep inside you that's hard to
hear, but it's there. And be careful 'cause there's really a lot of different
voices inside of you, and some belong to the worm, the fish, the frog, the
lizard, the ferret, the poo-flinging primate, and then finally that most
special and most meta of all, the ringmaster.

We all have a circus inside of us. The analogy to a 3-ring circus is good.
There's different acts like the lion-tamer, the high-diver, the tightrope
walker, the trapeze, the elephants balancing on balls and all the rest. As I
point out more and more, all the animal acts are actually quite inhumane and
should maybe be retired like the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus
actually had to do. But for now, the image is still strong and can probably do
you some good. We all need the Ringmaster in charge. The inner voice you should
be listening to is the Ringmaster's. The Ringmaster's voice is the one that
will eventually come out if you write regularly into a diary or a journal, like
I am essentially doing right now.

Okay, so what does the Ringmaster say to me right now? The most important
concept I have encountered in recent years is that of Ikigai. It is a Venn
diagram of the intersection of:

- What you love doing
- What you're good at
- What you can get paid for
- What the world needs

Is this a post about my dad's death after 30 years or about other stuff I found
along the way? It's about honoring his memory, and whoever I am today is a
result of many of the lessons that he knowingly and unknowingly instilled into
me. I didn't like to disappoint Dad. On the few times I did, it still resonates
in my head like it was yesterday. He taught me about much I feel in this
concept of Ikigai. He told me about his dreams and disappointments in life and
how it was from listening to the bad advice of his uncles, Jews from the
textile industry where a Jew could actually get jobs and stay employed.

You have to remember he comes from a time when IBM wouldn't hire Jews. His
dream of being going to Drexel and becoming an aeronautical engineer seemed
unattainable. I went to Drexel. I started out in mechanical engineering with
similar dreams of actually being one of the people helping to colonize our
solar system. I think today I might have been happier with microbiology like
that other Michael Levin working on epigenetic. Shaping who you are through
force-of-will like Green Lantern being real is beyond all hope and imagining
regarding the type of world we live in. Wow! How could anyone be a pessimist?

Everything relates to our journey here on this material world. My dad took his
turn here. I'm taking my turn here. You're taking your turn here. Doors are
opened for others through having kids. My parents opened the door for me. Your
parents opened the door for you. If you were to calculate the probability of
your existence you'd see it's rather unlikely and quite a gift. It doesn't hurt
to keep reminding yourself of that. It's yet another reason for gratitude.
Thanks Dad! Thanks for you being here and thanks for opening the door for me.
Thanks to you too, Mom. I'll give you your homage later.

So maybe we're just emergent properties of evolution or maybe we're spirits
from other realm invited in by virtue of the "vibe" established by the process
of sperm and egg combining in conception and a new unique code. That's your
most basic vibe and the "you" that you may be happy with, or may wish to
override when you become meta at 9, 10, 11 or 12 years old. By the time you're
13 or 14, you've done your first self-crafting, either intentionally or
unintentionally. If you've done a good job and kept yourself open-minded and
dynamic, you're golden. If you've become close-minded, embittered and angry,
you're going to have a tough life full of blame and not a lot of control over
your own destiny.

Human free-will is a thing. Or as the Green Lantern corps would point out, it's
actually sentient-life free-will that's a thing. Lots of being-types can
override the highest probability predetermined clockwork-universe type outcomes
of things. If you were a betting God, that's where things get interesting
because that's where things become surprising. How boring it must be to God,
knowing all that ever was and ever will be. The past is the future and the
future is the past and all that exists exists like a crystalline sculpture to
pick up and examine as a piece of art, but where's the surprise? Where's the
excitement of creation?

Surprise God. Make your life a life worth tuning-in and paying attention to.
Don't do what your uncles tell you to do because of their view of the world.
Observe for yourself. Have confidence in your ability to help shape and change
the world right as you engage in it. Observe patterns and step into the path of
love-worthy things. Do what you love. Do what you're good at, although that may
take a bit of time to accomplish. Do what you can get paid for. And ultimately,
try to align it to what the world needs.

My dad knew the world needed aeronautical engineers. Who from his generation
didn't know that (the space race). But whereas my dad allowed his dream to be
crushed, got into a bad marriage, and only barely transmitted to me his love of
things before he clocked out way too early (63 years old), find your love
earlier. I'm fifty-one years old. I'm only twelve years younger than my dad was
before he died. I do not think I only have twelve years left. I have so much to
live for, and I won't let the circumstances of my life crush me like it crushed
him. No, I'm going to love what I do going into these later years.

I am not a check-casher. Thank you Dad for teaching me that when I was only
twenty-one. I can imagine that would have been a lesson for me to learn in my
fifties and sixties like it was you.
