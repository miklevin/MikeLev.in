I don't consume much mass media but when I do, it's witty lyricists. If Linux,
Python, vim & git didn't end up being my calling, I would almost certainly have
been drawn to this sort of performance art with all my snarky double entendre
poetry and a sort of magic about it&#151;but I'm not nearly as cute.

# Don't Be So Humble, Whitney!

                             OKAY SO, THESE ARE
                            DAIRY-FREE CHEESE BALLS
                                 AND SINCE I'M
                               A LONGTIME VEGAN
                             WHO MAKES SILLY FACES
                                 FOR A LIVING
                                  I AM ALSO A
                            DAIRY-FREE CHEESE BALL
                           LET'S SEE WHO'S CHEESIER!

                                 WHEN YOUR DAY
                                HAS BEEN ROUGH
                             YOU DESERVE SOMETHING
                               CRUNCHY AND YUMMY
                           A SNACK THAT'S NOT TOUGH
                            ON YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT
                                 OR YOUR TUMMY

                         THEY'RE ADDICTIVELY DELICIOUS
                           YET INCREDIBLY NUTRITIOUS
                            SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR
                          AS YOU SAVOR ALL THE FLAVOR
                         THE SNACK IS NEVER BLAND 'N'
                        IT'LL MAKE YOUR DAY OUTSTANDIN'

                                 I'LL TELL YA
                               ONCE AND FOR ALL

                               JUST HAVE A BALL!

                                THEY'RE SO GOOD
                                  AND SOMEHOW
                             EVEN CHEESIER THAN ME

# If You Don't Love Cheesy Poofs, You'd Be Lame!

OMG, OMG, OMG, your lyrics never disappoint, Whitney! You are the first
performer I supported on Patreon and the best double entendre artist since
Benny Hill. Glad you love the Cheesy Poofs. You are definitely not lame. Not
Night Court in its fifth season lame&#151;no, you are fresh as the day you told
Cee Lo where to go. Whit, you're a top-tier Disney Princess in my book.
