description: As a QNAP NAS user, I recently received a notification that LXC files are no longer supported and I must transition to LXD. This left me with the need to do some research, which I have documented in this blog post. Read on to learn more about my journey and the results of my research.

Going into QNAP Container Station, a sort of Kubernetes, Jr. built into the
QNAP NAS (Network Application Server) suite, I got this message:

![Qnap Container Station Lxc End Of Support Notification Lxd](/assets/images/qnap-container-station-lxc-end-of-support-notification-lxd.png)

Hmm, I thought lxc files were the containers for the LXD service. I got some
learnings to do.
