Bard's 1st answer: Snow Crash and Rainbows End are two of the most influential science fiction novels of the 1990s. Both novels explore the potential of technology to transform society, and both have been cited as influential by a number of contemporary writers and thinkers.

Snow Crash is set in a near-future world where the internet has become a physical place, and where people can interact with each other through virtual avatars. The novel follows the story of Hiro Protagonist, a hacker who is drawn into a conspiracy to control the internet.

Rainbows End is set in a more distant future, where technology has advanced to the point where people can create and live in virtual worlds that are indistinguishable from the real world. The novel follows the story of Vernor Vinge, a retired computer scientist who is drawn back into the world of technology when he is diagnosed with a terminal illness.

Both novels have had a significant impact on today's society. Snow Crash has been praised for its prescient vision of the internet, and its exploration of the potential of virtual reality. Rainbows End has been praised for its exploration of the ethical implications of technology, and its vision of a future where technology is used to enhance human life.

It is difficult to say which novel has had a greater impact on today's society. Both novels have been influential in their own way, and both have helped to shape the way we think about technology.

As for the title, there is no plural possessive hyphen because the title is not a possessive. The title is a reference to the rainbow bridge that connects the physical world to the virtual world. The bridge is a metaphor for the way that technology can connect people from all over the world.

Notable in Bard's 2nd answer: Snow Crash and Rainbows End are two science fiction novels by Vernor Vinge that explore the potential impact of technology on society... not true.
