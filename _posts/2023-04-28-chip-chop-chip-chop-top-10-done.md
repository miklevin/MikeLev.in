I am in the process of wrangling a bunch of new stuff and practicing what I
preach. I've given up the "LPVG SEO" on my homepage, because although while I
believe in the Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg) platform as a distinctly
pragmatic tool-set worth learning as a group to make yourself old-school
obsolescence-resistant, but Levinux and Pipulate, those are some cool made-up
words. And they're mine. I've actually got something interesting to show on
each. 

Clearly, what's shaping up here is that Levinux won't go away, and that becomes
like the running joke. Kick Linux's Terminal-based Shell interface with no
investment more than a 20MB download and un-archiving it to a folder on your
Windows or Mac desktop. It's even less investment than the Windows subsystem
for Linux (WSL) which you can turn on by getting Ubuntu from the Microsoft
Store. It's ultimately best to do that, but before you do, you can try Levinux
and sample the ssh program and editing in vi (not even vim or NeoVim).

So there's Unix and Linux built into a lot of stuff. Linux won just in time for
radically new stuff to be designed by AI, or at very least, machine learning
assisted. Well, my answer to that is an API is an API. Just because better
underlying, superhumanly optimized amazing new hardware or whatever is
underneath there, but we still need to talk to it. Human-machine interface
languages have not gone obsolete. 

The Unix philosophies still apply in the post-AI-world, because issuing brief
commands on a command-line interface, referencing things we call files, and
piping outputs to inputs and all that happy stuff scales, what? Infinitely.
It's designed to be universal and portable that way. Timeless it is, that Unix
API. And so, Levinux. Get used to text-based Linux Terminal. It's tricky, but
not unable to be overcome. Approach and tackle it like a game. That kind of
problem-solving skill will pay off.

Pipulate? Well, there was a time when I thought that Levinux would be the
Noah's Ark of a code execution environment for Pipulate. Levinux being a qemu
PC emulator-based virtual machine as it is could have done that, but the
performance and development environment would have been terrible. So while
Levinux is a good easy intro to that old school environment, it's better to get
it through (if you're a Windows user) WSL, activated as WSL2 in all its glory
by installing Ubuntu through the Microsoft store. There are still some
conditions where Hypervisor has to be turned separately on.

So, Pipulate literally ran on Levinux, and it was a beautiful vision with
terrible performance. And so eventually, Microsoft's WSL platform became good
enough to host Pipulate. And Pipulate itself which had been in continual
transition of what it was, at one time providing its own Python webserver and a
bookmarklet system for your browser, it has most recently become an instance of
JupyterLab running with particular github repos pre-cloned into location on a
Linux VM.

Linux virtual machines provide utility much like Docker, but better because
it's a fully configurable Linux system with none of the Docker compositing
limitations. Why have the extra API-layer of containerized apps if you can just
install your apps straight-up on the instance of Linux running on a VM.
Sometimes you want your components tightly-coupled for overall simplicity and
performance, especially if you routinely rebuild your server from scratch using
server-build script.

And so after a variety of iterations of Pipulate, it has most recently settled
on being an SEO deliverable-maker... the secret sauce you can charge clients a
lot of money for knowing how to use and using on their behalf. They're busy and
don't have time for all that site marketing stuff, so they just need to hire
someone. You need a strategy to roll our content and to make your voice heard
in your space.

Push yourself up to that next level. Chip, chip, chip, chop, chop, chop.

Chip away and reveal the sculpture, chip, chip, chip. Chop your journal into
pages, posts, articles, entries or whatnot, chop, chop, chop.

Chip, chop, chip, chop.

That says it just about right. If you're not chipping, you ought not be
chopping or it's just babbling. Today's chop? Well I did a few chops today
already, but there's more in store... maybe, I hope.

Interestingly, the new in-vim buffer for the chop.py program is now the
keystroke `:b ch`[tab auto-complete]

These are the things that get into muscle memory and become important. There is
a muscle-memory address to bring up that particular file for editing now, and
so changes are easier because you can instantly jump there.

From there, I want to find where the Index page is being written, so the
keypress is `/index page[Enter]`

I like these backticks. It makes it easier to say inline in a sentence things
which I would in the past have broken up over multiple lines as a matter of
style, but this flows much better. Less interrupted and better use of white
space versus paragraph grey.

Okay, then next? I just repeat the loop that writes out the whole article index
include and make one that does the exact same thing, but limits it to 10
articles. Now link the homepage index.md to the new include...
