title: Journaling In Public With Copilot For The Sake of It
headline: Exploring GPT-4 and Sharing My Knowledge of Vim, NeoVim, and Vi
description: I'm exploring the possibilities of GPT-4, an AI trained on the entire internet, by attempting to get it to do programming. I'm also setting up a project with the MOZ API, and checking if anyone is around to chat. As a long-time user of vim, NeoVim, and vi, I'm sharing my knowledge of their efficiency and keystroke commands with any potential readers. I'm also providing a link to the MOZ Links API Documentation, so read on.

I use a macro to start a new journal entry. Oops, no color-coding. Let's fix
that. That's better. Markdown should look it if you've got a color-coding
syntax thingie going on as vim/NeoVim do. Thingie should be in the dictionary.
What's going on? Well, it's always something. Right now, for me it's this
freaky experience of opening up my journaling experience to GPT-4.

Oh, it's GPT-4 that I adore. It's the AI that's been trained on the entire
Internet. It's the one that's been trained on the entire Internet. It's the one
that's been trained on the entire Internet. It's the one that's been trained on
the entire Internet. It's the one that's been trained on the entire Internet. It
is the one that's been trained on the entire Internet. It's the one that's been
trained on the entire Internet. It's the one that's been trained on the entire

It smartz. Bizarro thing it is dead. Me no think it sentience. Me think it is
just a program. Me think it is just a program. Me think it is just a program.
Me think it is just a program. Me think it is just a program. Me think it is
just a program. Me think it is just a program. Me think it is just a program.
Me think it is just a program. Me think it is just a program. Me think it is

Well, you get the idea. I'll be kinda just testing it here. I want to know if
in this markdown environment I can trick it into treeing it like programming.
Let's see if we can get some Python with the gating backdticks of markdown,
shall we?

```python
def foo():
    return "bar"
```

That's really the end od the first example.


```python
def foo():
    return "bar"

def bar():
    return "foo"

print(foo())
```

That's the end of the second example.

Yeah, I don't have the patience for more of that. Let's see if anyone's here...

I'm just going to go like this for a bit, adding a new working repo to my
workflow. The work that I'm about to do warrants its own repo.

My repo root got initialized as a repo itself. Cleaning that up. Going to make
a new folder with a nice strong nickname for the MOZ Links API work I'm about
to do. This is an exercise in Robert Cialdini-style commitment and consistency
and spell checking. I think a lot of folks are interested in watching a casual
vim user, if even for it's value for ASMIR sake. Do I have that word right? I
don't think so.

You want to make a nice pristine starting point. Everything that's not "hidden"
as in one more folder-level deep to keep you from having to look at it all the
time leaves all the stuff (very few things, hopefully) that you DO want to look
at all the time. This new one I'm imaging will be one of those.

I'm trying to do the analog to that thing you do with multiple birds and one
stone that's to triggering to people to use as a metaphor anymore that I'm
trying to do. And I'll answer any questions as I go as I check chat. I don't
think I'll talk much.

I'm just going to call it what it is. I'm connecting to the MOZ API, so the
entire repo name is going to be MOZ...

Not everything you use needs to be free and open source. The "hosts" are often
(because they economically have to be) proprietary. There are exceptions.
Things like Raspberry Pi help show the way.

What is that laptop from that ex Facebook guy that's made from all upgradeable
parts?

I'm going to make a new folder for this project. I'm going to call it moz. I
keep it all lowercase so it's easiest to repeatedly type. I don't call it
mozseo or anything controversial like that. I want to go as plain vanilla as I
can.

This chat session in for nonsense. As you may notice, I am a fan. Nonsense of
Alice in Wonderland is second to nothing but Oz. For Dorothy was rather
no-nonsense. A world-view like Alice she hadn't. And lifetime friends on her
journey she made.

I'll occasionally flip screens to see if anyone's there, but feel free to chat.
I think the window is attached. Maybe I ought to double check.

Let's get this 3-screen muscle-memory thing stated to any possible future
audience (long-shot, I know).

This is your base of operations. It's vim, though it's NeoVim and vi too. It's
testament to ages long-ago when bandwidth was precious. Efficiency of
keystrokes is a thing in vim because it was a thing in vi. And so you it gets
into your fingers and is like driving a car. Muscle memory serves you well, for
life, really.

Can you see yourself using VSCode this way?

This is a public journal. Everything I write here goes on Web. Let's show you.
