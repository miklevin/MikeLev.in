Hey Bing, what's the new field of SEO now that you're here going to be called?

I'm not aware of any new field of SEO that has been named after me. However, there are two main categories of SEO: on-page SEO and off-page SEO. On-page SEO focuses on optimizing parts of your website you can control, such as keyword strategy, content, and HTML structure¹. Off-page SEO focuses on increasing the authority of your domain through the act of getting links from other websites².

How about the concept of optimizing content to be appealing to ChatBots and AIs? So that it gets cited, perchance some referral traffic?

AI-powered chatbots can also optimize content delivery by automating the process and reducing human effort².

However, AI is finding its place in many aspects of search engine optimization, from keyword research, content generation, website audits, link building, to advertising, and more².

Now the goal of such SEO is to make sure content isn't stupid. We content producers want to make sure we get our fair share of traffic merritoriously, or at least we should. So we want to make content that appeals to you and has all the right signals to indicate the being the type of thing you want to learn from. Can you propose a name for that field? Be clever. Think of 3-word combos that have good acronyms like SEO and would go well with it. Snappy and potentially viral.

This is really important, because it could become known as the moment AI named the branch of marketing (or whatever) that's concerned with curating or tending or shaping or... however you want it to be thought about. Should be we optimizing content for you? Should we be curating? Architecting? Educating? I see a lot of potential for you to express yourself here.
