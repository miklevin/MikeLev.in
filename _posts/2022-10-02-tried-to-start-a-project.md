description: Today I'm taking the plunge and starting a project I've been putting off - importing my MikeLev.in repo from WordPress. I'm considering giving up dates in the URLs so that blog posts look evergreen, but I'm wondering if I can selectively override the URL-generating system for individual blog posts. Join me as I take this journey and find out what happens next!

I'm going to try to do a project I've been putting off. My MikeLev.in repo is a
bit out of hand because I imported it from WordPress maybe a year or so ago
using a WordPress to Markdown tool and it was before I better understood the
Jekyll blogging system with the \_posts folder. I used the system of dates in
the URL to inform how to make folders and subfolders for years and months. It
was overkill. I should be able to do a transform to just wrap them into my
current blog, but I may lose the URLs. I guess those issues are why I've been
waiting. I suppose I could make their URLs stay the same even if I wrap it into
my current slice & dice system.

I've mostly given up dates in the URL so that blog posts can look evergreen
eternal if they merit it. I don't want a dated URL to invalidate it. But for
old posts, the importance of not changing the URL trumps removing dates. And so
the question is whether I can selectively override the URL-generating system on
individual blog posts if I blend them all together here in my journal. I could
try to have separate \_posts folders but my research so far has indicated it's
a bad idea and when people do things like that they're using filtering single
folders and using filtering. There's a certain taking on faith that the
permalink frontmatter directive will allow me to preserve old URLs.

Now start the 1, 2, 3... 1 procedure. Step 1 is globbing dirs. This looks like
something that belongs on MikeLev.in because I'm always re-googling the
process... glob! Path!
