description: I'm a purple unicorn and I know it. In this post, I'm exploring how to use RegEx in NeoVim, while others focus on SEO and marketing. I'm experimenting with producing original content to see what the filters make of it, and learning how to don the disguise of the buttoned-up, non-emotional types to have a seat at the table. Join me on my journey of self-discovery!

Haha, I push out a post that first introduces my YAMLchop/chop system to the
world and I label it how to use RegEx in NeoVim when I could have targeted some
damn OpenAI spammy thing and get a lot more YouTube view, LOL! Just shows you
how I miss the point and don't care. This is for practice. In a lot of ways
what I'm doing is for academic exercise. I need hands-on with just about
everything I discuss in a professional job capacity.

Others can always focus on the rote and frankly mundane and not very
interesting to me aspects of SEO and marketing. I'm a purple unicorn and I know
it. But the world needs purple unicorns too. Problem being the product of such 
a unicorn is not going to be as popular as the economic product of the old
workhorse... or the ass? Haha, well anyway it's time to drop a few words about
being a purple unicorn.

Two roads diverge in the woods, and everything else being equal we paraphrase
something Copilot can't even figure out, haha! I'm having a good time seeing
what's statistically going to be written next and contradicting it. I often
encounter people whose main interpersonal authority asserting tactic is instant
contraction. Make people get into the habit of hearing whatever you say
questioned, and they will be Pavlovian conditioned to automatically be
suspicious of anything you say. Those people scared of purple unicorns will try
to kill them as what they see out of the gate of some sort of race.

And so Github Copilot has completely given up on even proving autosuggest. And
no, I've check and I have not disabled it. Copilot is enabled. It just doesn't
have anything to say. This Rick is off the Central Finite Curve, which I always
thought was some sort of centerline of the average distribution curve, but
turns out to be something else, but I can't break the habit of thinking the
Rickest Rick is the one at the top of a bell-shaped curve where the inflection
point occurs, because that is the only point where there is not a symmetrically
opposite Rick. Clear?

Yeah, Copilot does not have an easy time with me. I think this bodes well with
this particular academic exercise I'm carrying out. Whereas my illustrious SEO
counterparts are conducting spam-cannon experiments about how many thousands of
remixed generative birdcall pages you can spin out with an OpenAI Wordpress
plugin, I'm experimenting with producing a critical mass of undeniably original
and non-AI-written content to see what the filters all make of it.

Yes, filters. The infinite spam cannon requires the infinite spam filter. And
helping my employer write the infinite spam filter to content with the infinite
spam cannon is shaping up to be one of my self-selected purple unicorn to-do
items. 

> I sometimes see a Unicorn
> That's purple but don't fear her.
> From the time that I was born
> It stared out from the mirror.

Am I really that, or just being silly and self-indulgent? Well, I have in fact
been told such and felt the attempts to knock me down a few pegs, but it always
feels like little hatchets chipping away at my ankles... uncles... ankles. I
often get the feeling that those who covet money and projecting a tight
buttoned-up appearance of authority and "the patriarchy" dislike this sort of
attitude and behavior pattern. 

They usually get into real estate, because it's really the best path for an
average person to become rich. Land is one of the only indisputable things of
value from which you can always extract money once you have it, the ultimate
passive income source for the ultimate passive minds. I don't vibe like a
landlord, that's for sure.

Such personalities are always at risk. They must occasionally don the disguise
of the buttoned-up, non-emotional, stiff upper lipped types to have a seat at
the table. And so, we do insofar as we can hold our noses and take the
medicine. The ridiculousness of such situations is perfectly channeled in the
Mad Hatter's tea party, by the way. Alice is a very rude girl.
