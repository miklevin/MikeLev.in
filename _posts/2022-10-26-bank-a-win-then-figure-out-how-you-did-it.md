title: Bank a Win Then Figure Out How You Did It
headline: "Embracing the Challenge of Tech: Banking a Win and Figuring It Out!"
description: I'm not a natural linguist, but I'm determined to pursue a career in tech because of its precise language. Instead of relying on others to do the work for me, I'm investing my free time to become more comfortable with the language of technology. I'm banking a win and embracing the challenge, just like a Thanksgiving turkey!

I do a lot of writing in SimpleNote in the bathtub and stuff that normally
doesn't reach here. These are mostly unfinished pieces, but none-the-less would
still appear here if I just did the original writing in my journal. But I'm
trying to keep SimpleNote clear of everything except what's new and
top-of-mind, so occasionally I'm going to "dump" some of that content here.
Here's one.

The world has greatly turned your way. What it values is different than when
you were young. Your introversion and nerdiness are currently well-paired with
the tools that are out. It still feels like it should have been Amiga, but Unix
via Linux on fairly cool hardware will do. Time is running out and nothing
evolved is all that well optimized. It has more of a get 'er done attitude.
Reminds me of the 80/20-rule. Bank a win.

Bank a win then figure out how you did it. Make it reproducible, and preferably
portable between hardware platforms. Don't allow your know-how to be tied to a
time, place or particular hardware platform. You can't get away from being tied
to a software platform because you need to learn something to operate the
hardware. Application program interfaces, or APIs, are simplified languages for
talking to hardware. You learn APIs. APIs should be very portable.

Desktop and mobile point and click software is quite mobile if licensing issues
like Apples aren't stopping you. But graphics-based software is uniquely tied
to hardware because of the need for a high-resolution pointing device. This
very much ties software that focuses on the human user interface to the
hardware of the day and sets the stage for your skills going obsolete has that
hardware platform goes out of fashion and out of production.

So we switch tools. We re-learn the new human interface software for new
hardware and a new platform. We pay a new cloud overlords for old things done
in new ways. Those good at this process, switching tools and never falling in
love with specific medium and craft, excel. They can flit from language to
language and API to API as if butterflies to flowers. Oh how I envy them. I am
not one of them. I like to settle in on tools for awhile, getting to know their
ins and outs, nuances and forever improve.

Some people are naturally multi-lingual and can talk to different hardware
easily. I'm jealous of them. Others take shortcuts seizing on single ways of
doing a thing and shut their minds, sometimes violently, against the new. This
can work for them and they can protect turf and "widen the moat" in Warren
Buffett terms and I'm a bit jealous of them too. But here in the middle is
actually not a bad place to be if the tools are cool and you can fall in love
with your craft.

I know I love using language to express but am not naturally multi-lingual nor
all that quick on the uptake. New abstractions come slowly to me and telling
one from another is difficult, such as between Algebra and Calculus. Yet I'm
pinning my career and livelihood exactly on such a selection of tools and
language that will take me forever to master. That such Goldilocks-tools even
today exist today balanced between the top-technical and too-simple is a
miracle.

Even if one day you can speak with an AI that is capable of doing almost
anything and everything better than you including coding, it is still good to
learn coding. It is for the same reason that it is still good to learn to
drive. Not doing so is tantamount to giving up.

And I choose this path. I choose it because it enables me to hold discourse in
the precise language of technology.

Many will skip learning how to program computers or even to drive, figuring of
you just wait long enough, you'll always have someone to do it for you and
you'll always have a ride because AI. If you look carefully at that situation,
they're waiting for either servants or surrogate parents. They're trying to
remain in a child-like state. A life of luxury, free time and fattening up like
a Thanksgiving turkey.
