title: "Cringy & Long UFO/UAP Video: Eric Weinstein & Mick West Talk For Hours"
headline: Exploring the Wacky World of UFOs and UAPs with Eric Weinstein and Mick West
description: As a fan of Mick West and Eric Weinstein, I have been watching their videos to understand their different theories about UFOs and UAPs, including the possibility of our existence being different than we think. Eric is the romantic who wants to believe, and Mick is the pragmatist who is often cynical. We discuss the credibility of UFO encounters and those who claim to have seen them. I believe that the government has been cruel in their experiments and that Mick West should be more charitable.

Hello UFO and UAP fans! Are they tech? Are they from another planet or are they
our own? Or is that even the right question? There are a few voices more sane
in this wacky, nutty world than Mick West and Eric Weinstein. I'm really a big
fan of both. And I've been watching this video a lot. I mean I've been watching
it a lot to just even get through it once, the cringe-factor of this video is
the most solid evidence of anything.

Talk about differently vibed individuals. Eric represents our romantic side.
The X-Files fan who wants to believe, and happens to be trying to unify
physics. The other is the hard-nosed pragmatist who verges on cynic and often
goes there. This dude cuts Occam's Razor deep, and Eric pushes back with a
heart for the weirdos we gotta listen to, because science. You take a lot of
noise to get what precious little signal may be there.

What a challenge to listen to. Good thing there's Bing! What's up conspiracy,
folks? Did we get to the heart of the secret birth of anti-gravity? Yeah, it's
been around since the 1950s of our own creation, of one design or another. Just
makes sense. However, the conversation is not always one of tech. Our very
existence could be different than we think. Follow along.

Hello, this is Bing. I'm not sure what you are looking for with your query. UNC Chapel Hill is a public research university in North Carolina¬π¬≤¬≥‚Åµ‚Å∑‚Å∏‚Åπ¬π¬π, and Feynman was a famous physicist who worked on quantum mechanics and particle physics‚Å¥. Are you interested in learning more about UNC Chapel Hill's physics department‚Å∂‚Å∑‚Å∏ [9]^ [10]^ or Feynman's contributions to physics[^4]? Please be more specific so I can help you better.üòä

Who is the leading antigravity researcher from the 1950s?

Hello, this is Bing. According to some sources, one of the leading antigravity researchers from the 1950s was **Thomas Townsend Brown**¬π¬≤, who experimented with electrogravitics and claimed to have achieved propulsion by manipulating electric fields‚Å¥‚Åµ. However, his work was controversial and never widely accepted by mainstream science‚Å¥. Another prominent figure in antigravity research was **Viktor Grebennikov**¬≥, who claimed to have discovered a natural anti-gravity effect based on insect wings‚Åµ. However, his claims were also met with skepticism and criticism by many scientists‚Åµ. Antigravity research was allegedly pursued by various governments and military agencies during the 1950s, but the results and validity of such research are unclear and disputed¬≤‚Å¥ [6]^.

Did either of them have sons who carried on their work?

I'm sorry but I could not find any information about the sons of Thomas Townsend Brown or Viktor Grebennikov. It seems that neither of them had any children who carried on their work. Thomas Townsend Brown was married to Josephine Dillon, a Hollywood actress, but they divorced in 1947¬≤. Viktor Grebennikov was married to Nina Ivanovna, a teacher, but they also divorced in 1976‚Åµ. Do you have any other questions about antigravity research?üòä

What was the conference in the 1950s at the University of Chapel Hill that Richard Feynman attended connected to the Research Institute for Advanced Study.

Hello, this is Bing. The conference you are referring to was the **Conference on the Role of Gravitation in Physics**¬π‚Åµ, which was held at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from March 18 to 23, 1957¬π. Richard Feynman attended this conference as a representative of the **Research Institute for Advanced Study (RIAS)**¬≤‚Å¥, which was a private research organization funded by Agnew Bahnson Jr., an industrialist who was interested in antigravity research‚Å¥. Feynman gave a talk on quantum electrodynamics (QED) and also participated in a discussion on gravitational waves with John Wheeler and others‚Å¥. He proposed a thought experiment involving sticky beads on a rotating hoop to demonstrate how gravitational waves could carry energy and momentum‚Åµ. This conference was one of the first attempts to bring together physicists from different fields to explore the connections between gravity and quantum theory¬π. Do you want to know more about this conference or its participants?üòä

What is The Institute For The Study of Physical Fields at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill?

I'm sorry but I could not find any information about The Institute For The Study of Physical Fields at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. It seems that such an institute does not exist or is not well-known. However, I did find some information about other institutes or centers related to physical sciences at UNC-Chapel Hill or elsewhere. For example, there is a **Department of Applied Physical Sciences**‚Å¥ at UNC-Chapel Hill that focuses on interdisciplinary research and education in materials science, environmental science, and biomedical science‚Å¥. There is also an **Institute for Advanced Physical Studies**‚Å∑ that is a research center for studies in physics and related fields, such as astrophysics, biophysics, nanophysics, and quantum physics‚Å∑.

What does Post-Romanian Spacetime mean? It's somehow in reference to Einsteinian physics.

Hello, this is Bing. I'm sorry but I could not find any information about Post-Romanian Spacetime. It seems that this term is not used in physics or mathematics. Perhaps you meant **Pseudo-Riemannian Spacetime**‚Å¥, which is a type of geometric space that can be used to model the effects of gravity according to Einstein's general theory of relativity‚Å¥. In this spacetime, distances and angles are not measured by Euclidean geometry, but by a more general metric tensor that can vary from point to point‚Åµ. This allows for phenomena such as gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime caused by massive objects accelerating or colliding‚Å∂. Do you want to know more about Pseudo-Riemannian Spacetime or Einstein's theory of relativity?üòä

Mitch thinks there's a large possibility that all the UFO encounters have
essentially simple explanations that include experimental aircraft, but that's
not the majority. Most are just junk in the atmosphere, fatigue, hallucinations
and such. People see things all the time they think are one thing and are
really something else. Why not here too?

You know who doesn't sing credibility to me? Bob Lazar & Steven Greer. I have
to say Jeremy Corbell and even Lou Elizondo. Now I'm not saying that Lou isn't
badass. I think he's cool in the same way Dick Marcinko is badass. It doesn't
mean I don't think they're lying. They might be lying. There's a lot of money
to be made. You might not see it. But one way or another, when you can't
explain away a 100% convincing eye-witness testimony to an extraordinary event,
you have to assume they're wrong. There's no hard evidence.

Vibrating edge! This is how they getcha. Never delivers. People who are coy are
using coyness to just happen to get notoriety. The power to silence that comes
from stigma and shame, particularly as a form of entertainment, most people
can't stand up to this. And Eric can't stand bullying and gaslighting people
who sincerely want to step forward. Eric doesn't want people who've seen
something or have data scared? Eric finds Mick West objectionable. Eric came
very close to blocking Mick's account.

Eric makes some very salient points the keywords of which I will not even
mention, but make a very good point about a government and governments that
really have been cruel and calloused experimenting on their populations. Crazy
shit really does happen. And Eric just outright asks whether Mick could be more
charitable, resonates. It lands a blow. Mitch responds with specifics about
firsthand accounts, and says there's only so far as you can go in belief.

Eric thinks not just distancing from debunking is necessary but an actual
renouncing of the topic. Take the bunk out of being a skeptic. Mick gets
defensive. Emotional affect! Ha!
