title: A Tale of Two Pipers
headline: "Choose Wisely: The Consequences of Following the Falsey or FLOSSy Pied Pipers"
description: Today, I heard a thought-provoking poem by Mike Levin about the two types of Pied Pipers - the Falsey and the FLOSSy - and the consequences of choosing which one to follow. It could be a Chromium swiper or a Terminal typer, and it will decide whether you are sealed or free. I invite you to read my blog post to learn more about this fascinating poem.
