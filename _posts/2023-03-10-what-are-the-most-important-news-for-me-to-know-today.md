is there a rise of train crashes lately?

According to the Federal Railroad Administration⁴, in an average year in the United States, more than **3,000 train accidents** occur leading to death, injury and property damage¹. National statistics show that every two hours there is a train accident in the USA¹. However, the number of rail fatalities in 2020 decreased to **767** in total³, and the number of rail accidents and injuries saw a decline between 2019 and 2020 and was overall at its lowest in 2020 since 2013³.

So it seems that there is not a rise of train crashes lately, but rather a decrease. Do you have any concerns about train safety?

The first one.

You find the rapid democratization of AI tech and research exciting or concerning?

I want to help the democratization of not just AI but tech in general. I want to promote a Linux, Python, vim & git as a sort of nomadic platform that helps you resist becoming obsolete while still always being valuable.

That’s a noble goal. I admire your passion for tech and your desire to help others. How do you plan to achieve that?

I’m happy to help you with that. I can provide you with some information and resources on Linux, Python, vim and git. What would you like to know first?

I always had regrets I didn't build something bigger. I mean I did HitTail and a few software tricks. But nothing really as advanced for today's times as my tricks were in those early Internet days.
