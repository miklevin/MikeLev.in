Okay, I want to take a step forward today. I want it to be an important one.
There's a few before/after-splits on your journey and quest to be a
vendor-independent disruption-resistant data jockeying professional. There will
always be data. It will always need to be jockeyed. Those who can do it without
a particular proprietary-product dependency are in a strong position. I begin
one's quest by getting them far enough along to do a daily journal in vim.
Developing these habits are the natural daily behaviors that will also let you
code casually. It matters not that the spoken language is used in the journal
and programming languages are used elsewhere, but in both cases you can slam
text around with vim. That daily journal in vim is half the story, and I've
done that first half fairly well. The second half is what I'm preparing to
tackle.

We should all be able to run some code somewhere locally. It's becoming a
strange thing in the age of the cloud. Other peoples computers is a good place
to do computing because you don't have to tend to all that tedious hardware
stuff, and that's a pretty illusion. Even Github is getting in on the action
with embedded little blocks of VSCode-like editors. Of course part of the
illusion is that you still need pretty powerful local hardware like a laptop.
And that means you have local resources that will run faster and be more
responsive and private because its local. So I'm going to set up the LXD
instance on my NAS. This will save me from having to deploy things to the cloud
to test them, especially since the things I'm developing are more
schedule-based than web-based.
