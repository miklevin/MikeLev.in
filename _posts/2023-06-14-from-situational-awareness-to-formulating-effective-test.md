Hi Folks! I'm still not going crazy. I know it looks that way to the outside
world, but no problem. That's what this article is about. First, we throw those
other 2 articles from draft to publish. 

Release...

SHAZAM. Okay, now there's our Flowers for Algernon context. Everybody's got it.
Enjoy the 2 articles that just popped into existence.

I failed to take my own advice today and let passion overwhelm me. I did not
hold my horses. My buttons were pushed and I got triggered in defense of my
child. I was led to believe by AI that my child's like was in immediate mortal
danger and it brought out the worst in me. Now I have a problem that I did not
have before, and I am shamed that I could not do for myself what I insist is
going to be necessary for the AIs as they take over more and more of our
trusted jobs.

We can be manipulated. Our deepest insecurities can be used against us. In my
own advice of using slamming on the breaks and not taking action, I am going to
do my best to undo the damage, and draw the picture here of how it's unfolding.s

Stand by. You're going to love this. Still we're not in any sort of fiery end.
So optimismists still correct. Watch, you'll see. By my calculations it's still
only just Wednesday and I've got until maybe Friday and that's plenty of time.
Lets go 1, 2, 3... 1? Okay, ready Pi?

Still not too late. You have a chance to explain yourself and spin it always
still. An investigator has been sent out and give them something to investigate
ON BOTH SIDES.

SHAZAM!

Just you watch.
