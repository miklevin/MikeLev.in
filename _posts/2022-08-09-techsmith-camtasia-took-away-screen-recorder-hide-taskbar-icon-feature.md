title: TechSmith Camtasia Took Away Screen Recorder Hide Taskbar Icon Feature
headline: "Learning Blender to Replace Camtasia: Why I Won't Edit Videos to Hide Taskbar Icon"
description: As a video creator, I'm considering learning Blender to replace TechSmith Camtasia's recent feature roll-back which removed the ability to hide the taskbar icon for the screen recorder. I recently recorded a video discussing why I won't edit my videos just to hide the taskbar icon. Come read my blog post to find out why!

How to record your day-to-day work honestly and without much editing.

Can you imagine the video editing just on this sequence if I weren't just
showing you everything? 2x longer? 10x longer?

- I push out videos maybe once/day, sometimes more.
- Sometimes less, but I'm working on it.
  - NOT introduce more editing
  - Python automation to eliminate editing

This allows me to go at a very fast pace.

I'm uncompromising on certain things (like minimal editing)

I'm compromising on certain things, like dealing with quirks, feature
roll-backs (come on TechSmith! Don't do that) to get a type of software that
isn't (yet) better in the Free & Open Source Software world.

I may learn Blender to see if it has these TechSmith Camtasia screen recorder &
editing features.

I just recorded a video that explains why I won't edit my videos just to hide
the Taskbar Icon for the Screen Recorder.

This was my first video recording with the Camtasia 2020 recorder, while doing
the editing with Camtasia 2022. Why? Because only Screen Recorder 2020 or
earlier has this feature, an important reason why I use(d) it, and only the
newer editors make the user interface fonts large enough for my poor old eyes
to read.
