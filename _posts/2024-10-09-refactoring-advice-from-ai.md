It's time to get some refactoring advice from AI. But I'm going to give it
context down to the metal, and get the advice from the two best things going
right now in LLM frontier models: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI ChatGPT
o1-Preview. Google Gemini Advanced may be up there too, but since I stopped
paying $250 a month for the privilege of using Google Apps and went down to the
$100/mo tier, I got cut off from it... so be it. My tutorials will now just
address the two I'm subscribed to for $20/mo and not the third I'm already
effectively paying at that level for and don't receive. The $20/mo for Claude by
the way is for Cursor AI and when I use Claude directly on Claude.AI, I'm using
the free tier. Anyway, that's the background on which AIs in this tutorial.

BEGIN PROMPTIFICATION

You are an expert Python programmer, recognizing the weird idiomatic difference
between Python and other environments that let mainstream projects still get
kooky and be okay, because it can be that way in Python. You are consulting on
one of those situations, and I am tapping your advice for porting an old program
where I got lots of things wrong with a new program that sets the rules for
rightness--though even that can be gradually improved over time, as these things
are.

I have two programs. They are both attempts at moving to the new Python FastHTML
web framework that patterns after Flask, but derives from Startlette and ASGI
Uvicorn, eliminating all use of Jinga2 or JSX template systems. Instead, it
`from import fasthtml.common import *` to get HTML idiomatically named Python
functions like `P()` for paragraph `<p>` and `Div()` for `<div>`. That means any
appearance of raw HTML tags, JavaScript or CSS is bad form, although an entire
web application can be expressed in a single `filename.py`, with no apparent
outside dependencies. Of course, dependencies are slipped in to help the page
emit to a standard browser properly, including JavaScript and CSS includes such
as htmx.js, fasthtml.js, ws.js, surreal.js, and PicoCSS.

This micro framework for web development include allows you to work in an
environment that approaches pure idiomatic blend of Python with HTML, in a near
perfect 1-to-1 mapping between the Python API and HTML, by which HTML elements
become Python functions and attributes and their values become parameters and
arguments. HTMX is also elegantly blended in at this point, extending the 1-to-1
mappings by which HTMX attributes like `hx-get` become the `hx_get` attribute of
an `A()` link. Styling makes heavy use of PicoCSS whereby `Group()` can keep
`Div()`'s side-by-side on the same row horizontally.

This is not FastAPI. This is FastHTML, which is different even though some of
their functionality overlaps. Specific capabilities FastHTML provides easy,
access to is database for persistence and WebSockets for asynchronous
communication and streaming information from long-running tasks that the uvicorn
asgi webserver itself may a have started. Databases use the MiniDataAPI spec,
wrapped and are optionally returned with a call to create the server instances:

```python
app, rt, (users, User), (todos, Todo) = fast_app(
    "data/database.db",
    ...
)
```

A more complete example with the table structure with a general single-tenant
persistence object looks like this:

```python
app, rt, (store, Store), (todos, Todo) = fast_app(  # Unpack the tables directly
    "data/pipulate.db",  # Database file path
    ws_hdr=True,  # Enable WebSocket headers
    live=True,  # Enable live updates
    render=render,  # Set the render function for todos
    store={
        "key": str,
        "value": str,
        "pk": "key"  # Primary key for the store
    },
    todos={
        "id": int,
        "title": str,
        "done": bool,
        "profile_id": str,  # Added profile_id to todos
        "pk": "id"  # Primary key for todos
    },
)
```

Me: Excellent, thank you Claude! Use those same criteria to extract a similar
micro article from this documenting the basic CRUD operations you can do with a
Todo app with the fastlite and MicroDataAPI interfaces exposed through FastHTML
in the unique way it does, demonstrated below. You can ignore update since it
makes such heavy use of stuff outside the framework.

# Basic CRUD Operations with FastHTML and MicroDataAPI

FastHTML, a Python web framework, offers a unique approach to web development by
blending Python with HTML in an idiomatic way. It provides easy access to
database operations through the MicroDataAPI, allowing for simple CRUD (Create,
Read, Delete) operations. Here's a concise overview of how to implement these
operations in a Todo app using FastHTML.

## Setup

First, set up the application and database:

```python
from fasthtml.common import *

app, rt, (store, Store), (todos, Todo) = fast_app(
    "data/pipulate.db",
    ws_hdr=True,
    live=True,
    render=render,
    store={
        "key": str,
        "value": str,
        "pk": "key"
    },
    todos={
        "id": int,
        "title": str,
        "done": bool,
        "profile_id": str,
        "pk": "id"
    },
)
```

## Create (POST)

To add a new todo item:

```python
@rt('/todo')
async def post_todo(todo: Todo):
    if not todo.title.strip():
        return ''
    current_profile_id = db.get("last_profile_choice", "default_profile")
    todo.profile_id = current_profile_id
    inserted_todo = todos.insert(todo)
    return render(inserted_todo), todo_mk_input()
```

## Read (GET)

To display all todo items:

```python
@rt('/')
@rt('/todo')
def get(request):
    current_profile_id = db.get("last_profile_choice", "default_profile")
    todos.xtra(profile_id=current_profile_id)
    return Container(
        Ul(*[render(todo) for todo in todos()], id='todo-list'),
        # ... other UI elements
    )
```

## Delete

To remove a todo item:

```python
@rt('/{tid}')
async def delete(tid: int):
    todo = todos[tid]
    todos.delete(tid)
    return ''
```

This example demonstrates how FastHTML simplifies CRUD operations using the
MicroDataAPI. The framework's approach allows for a seamless integration of
Python, HTML, and database operations, making it easier to create dynamic web
applications with persistent data storage.

Key points:

1. Database setup is handled through the `fast_app` function.
2. CRUD operations are implemented as route handlers using the `@rt` decorator.
3. The MicroDataAPI provides simple methods like `insert`, `delete`, and accessing items through indexing.
4. FastHTML's integration with HTMX allows for dynamic updates without page reloads.

This approach showcases the power and simplicity of FastHTML in creating web
applications with database interactions, all within a single Python file.

Me: I need to get the point across about WebSockets being built into FastHTML
and the dependencies that are visible in that file that support this magic. Make
sure that in the example you provide that if it represents a typing word-by-word
effect, that it's because the service being called is actually sending data back
like that and that it's not a simulated effect. Make a mini-article explaining
this awesomeness and the new world of WebSocket such that almost anything can
have chat features and long-running back-channel messaging streams. Don't be
bombastic or use hyperbole. Just state it like the amazing new facts they are.

Claude: Certainly. Here's a mini-article explaining the WebSocket integration in
FastHTML and its implications for real-time, chat-like features:

---

WebSockets and Real-Time Communication in FastHTML

FastHTML, a Python web framework, has built-in WebSocket support, simplifying
the creation of real-time, bidirectional communication channels between servers
and clients. This integration, coupled with asynchronous programming, enables
developers to easily implement chat-like features and long-running background
processes with live updates.

Key Components:

1. FastHTML's WebSocket support
2. Asynchronous programming with `asyncio`
3. HTMX for seamless client-side updates

Here's a concise example demonstrating real-time, word-by-word streaming from a server process:

```python
import asyncio
from fasthtml.common import *
from starlette.concurrency import run_in_threadpool

async def on_conn(ws, send):
    users[str(id(ws))] = send

@app.ws('/ws', conn=on_conn)
async def ws(msg: str):
    asyncio.create_task(stream_chat(msg))

async def stream_chat(prompt: str):
    async for word in chat_with_ollama(model, prompt):
        for user in users.values():
            await user(
                Div(
                    word,
                    id='msg-list',
                    cls='fade-in',
                    _="this.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth'});"
                )
            )
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)

async def chat_with_ollama(model, prompt):
    response = await run_in_threadpool(
        lambda: requests.post(
            "http://localhost:11434/api/chat",
            json={"model": model, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], "stream": True},
            stream=True
        )
    )
    for chunk in response.iter_lines():
        if chunk:
            yield json.loads(chunk)['message']['content']
```

This example showcases:

1. WebSocket connection handling with `on_conn` and the `@app.ws` decorator
2. Asynchronous task creation for non-blocking chat processing
3. Real-time, word-by-word streaming from an external AI service (Ollama)
4. Live updates to all connected clients using WebSockets

The integration of WebSockets into FastHTML opens up new possibilities for
developers. Now, almost any web application can incorporate chat features or
long-running background processes with live updates. This approach reduces the
complexity traditionally associated with implementing real-time features, making
it more accessible to a wider range of developers and applications.

By leveraging WebSockets, asynchronous programming, and HTMX, developers can
create responsive, engaging user experiences with minimal overhead. This
combination of technologies enables the creation of dynamic, real-time web
applications that were previously much more challenging to implement.

This mini-article provides a factual overview of the WebSocket integration in
FastHTML and its implications for real-time web applications, without resorting
to hyperbole or exaggeration.

Okay, now with all of that in mind please examine the following two FastHTML
apps. In the first, I did not know better, and used the popular zero-wait
message queue, or ZeroMQ, or just zmq to do everything I now realize I should
have used WebSockets with the `@ws` decorator built into FastHTML for. I also
used a local JSON file that I read and write to for a persistent database
object, before I realized FastHTML had such things built in and has the
advantages of better integration and workflow.

The second app is built with much more pure FastHTML and provides good examples
of how to do well each thing I did poorly on the prior app. The second app has a
framework by which new apps can be plugged in and made available on a dropdown
menu, such as Profiles and Todo List. An actual Todo app resides on the Todo
List menu option, but the Profiles page is left blank. It's an "empty space"
such as it were for plugging new apps into this system.

Almost every interaction you have with the app informs the local LLM of what the
user just did, and it has a chance to comment to the user. This is a hook for
much future expansion, such as the LLM talking you through how to use the app,
and having the ability to interact with your data like adding Todo items on
request. We are not going there right now, but this is an area for future
growth. The point being that a mechanism exists to support long-running
communication which may be coming from a local LLM, or it may be explicitly
streaming from long-running apps in the background which are also being run by
the same server instance. 

These streaming connections, plus the database persistence creates a robust
environment for plugging in apps that trigger long-running tasks presented
structured for the user as part of workflows. In other words, if a user has to
do tasks A, B and C, the chatbot can start talking them through it and keep them
entertained with jokes while waiting for a long-running task to finish.

The second app is what I am moving towards. It is not yet a plugin framework due
to the deep integration between parts and the ability to see the whole app in a
single `filename.py`. So at least in the short term, new "apps" to be "plugged
in" to this system will go in such empty places as the Explore tab on the nav
menu. So while this application is single-tenant right now, the Profiles menu on
nav lets you switch between different Profiles, keeping the Todo apps of one
profile separate from another, using the .xtra() filtering feature.

Hey Claude, explain .xtra() to the nice folks!

### Understanding `.xtra()` in the MiniDataAPI Specification

The `.xtra()` method in MiniDataAPI provides a powerful yet straightforward way
to apply field-level constraints that automatically filter results during
database operations. By setting values within `.xtra()`, you effectively create
a context-sensitive view of the table, restricting access and manipulation based
on predefined criteria.

#### Key Features of `.xtra()`

1. **Field-Level Filtering**: Once fields are set with `.xtra()`, all subsequent
   queries on that table—including lookups, inserts, updates, and deletions—are
   filtered by those field values. For example, if you set
   `todos.xtra(name='Charlie')`, only records with `name='Charlie'` will be
   accessible in the `todos` table.
2. **Query Context Management**: The constraints defined by `.xtra()` persist
   across operations unless explicitly removed or reset. This is especially
   useful for multi-tenant applications where each user or role should see only
   their own subset of records.
3. **Automatic Field Setting**: When inserting new records after using
   `.xtra()`, the set fields are automatically included in the new record. This
   prevents accidentally inserting items that violate the defined constraints.
4. **No Effect on `.create()` Method**: The `.xtra()` filtering applies only to
   records and does not impact table creation or structure modifications.

#### Example Usage of `.xtra()`

Consider a `todos` table where each record has a `name` field representing the
user assigned to a task. Setting `.xtra(name='Charlie')` will ensure that only
Charlie’s TODOs are visible:

```python
# Set .xtra filter to limit access to Charlie's records only
todos.xtra(name='Charlie')

# Retrieving all records now only returns Charlie's TODOs
todos()  # Output: [Todo(id=3, title='Finish development of FastHTML', name='Charlie')]

# Attempting to access or update records not assigned to Charlie will raise NotFoundError
try:
    todos[1]  # Accessing ID 1 will fail if it's not assigned to Charlie
except NotFoundError:
    print("Record not found")  # Output: "Record not found"
```

#### Use Cases for `.xtra()`

- **Role-Based Access Control**: `.xtra()` can enforce record visibility rules
  based on user roles or permissions, limiting the scope of data operations to
  relevant entries.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: In a shared database with multiple clients or users,
  `.xtra()` ensures that each user interacts only with their designated records.
- **Simplifying Complex Queries**: By setting `.xtra()` filters, you can avoid
  repetitive query conditions, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Limitations

- **Constraints are Sticky**: Once `.xtra()` is set, all interactions with the
  table will honor the constraints. This can be both a strength and a limitation
  depending on the context.
- **Implicit Filtering**: `.xtra()` does not provide visual cues in code
  indicating active constraints, which can lead to unexpected results if not
  carefully managed.

The `.xtra()` method extends the simplicity of MiniDataAPI by providing a
straightforward way to apply dynamic filtering rules at the table level. This
feature allows developers to enforce consistent data access patterns with
minimal overhead, ensuring that data integrity is maintained across operations.

So you see, I don't support username and password login just yet, and don't try
to as part of your response, but I have left nice hooks for separating user
data, implemented in-part on sorting the Todo items between Profiles.

Now, what I want you to do is to carefully walk through the first version of the
app, named `server.py` and form a plan for porting it to live within the second
version of the app, named `pipulate.py`. The output is intended to be a third
program called `botifython.py` which will take the place of pipulate.py.

User interface issues you will encounter include the need to set a Botify API
Token if one is not present for which I used environment variables. I have found
this complicated and cumbersome as they are read, deleted and such. So make the
Token-setting aspect of this use the `db = DictLikeDB(store, Store)` that's used
for other similar persistent data in pipulate.py. You can forget about using
`dotenv`. In fact one of the goals here is to reduce the number of imported
libraries, cutting out everything that's not essential and part of the FastHTML
"way". So certainly any use of things that "go around" FastHTML like aiohttp
should be kept out of the port.

As you move through the user interface issues, you will encounter details of
persistence and long-running communication. Every time you encounter a generic
persistence requirement, use the `db = DictLikeDB(store, Store)` dictionary-like
object, knowing this is how it works:

```python
# *******************************
# DictLikeDB Persistence Convenience Wrapper
# *******************************
class DictLikeDB:
    """A wrapper class for a dictionary-like database to simplify access."""
    
    def __init__(self, store, Store):
        self.store = store  # Store reference
        self.Store = Store  # Store class reference

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        """Retrieve an item from the store by key."""
        try:
            return self.store[key].value  # Return the value associated with the key
        except NotFoundError:
            raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if not found

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        """Set an item in the store by key."""
        try:
            # Try to update existing item
            self.store.update({"key": key, "value": value})
        except NotFoundError:
            # If it doesn't exist, insert a new item
            self.store.insert({"key": key, "value": value})

    def __delitem__(self, key):
        """Delete an item from the store by key."""
        try:
            self.store.delete(key)  # Delete the item
        except NotFoundError:
            raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if not found

    def __contains__(self, key):
        """Check if a key exists in the store."""
        return key in self.store

    def __iter__(self):
        """Iterate over the keys in the store."""
        for item in self.store():
            yield item.key  # Yield each key

    def items(self):
        """Return key-value pairs in the store."""
        for item in self.store():
            yield item.key, item.value  # Yield key-value pairs

    def keys(self):
        """Return a list of keys in the store."""
        return list(self)

    def values(self):
        """Return values in the store."""
        for item in self.store():
            yield item.value  # Yield each value

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        """Get an item from the store, returning default if not found."""
        try:
            return self[key]  # Attempt to retrieve the item
        except KeyError:
            return default  # Return default if not found

# Create the wrapper
db = DictLikeDB(store, Store)
```

Be conservative in the port, only trying to do things that you are almost
certain will work given the examples provided. When you have to choose between 2
ways of doing something, always favor the way provided in version 2,
`pipulate.py`.

When dealing with particularly sticky issues, employ the 80/20-rule in choosing
solutions. Try to get 80% of the intended benefit from the first 20% of the work
you're willing to put into it. Do rabbit-hole evaluations before committing to
exploring them. A single bad choice can derail an endeavor by virtue of
exploding, cascading complexity. Identify those signs early, back-up and
re-evaluate your approach.

Do this as many times as you feel is necessary to make a plan to integrate the
application implied by version 1 into the plug-in like framework and better
adherence to FastHTML methodology of version 2. Please and thank you!

   - Avoid using `dotenv`, `aiohttp`, `zmq`, and other external libraries not essential to FastHTML.

10. **Testing and Validation:**
    - Test each component as it is integrated to ensure functionality.
    - Validate that the application runs without errors and meets the requirements.

---

### **Detailed Steps**

#### **1. Set Up `botifython.py`**

- Copy `pipulate.py` to a new file named `botifython.py`.
- Update the application name and any relevant metadata.

#### **2. Replace Environment Variables with `DictLikeDB`**

- In `server.py`, the Botify API token is stored in environment variables using `dotenv`.
- In `botifython.py`, use `db = DictLikeDB(store, Store)` to store the token.

**Example:**

```python
# Store the Botify API token
db['botify_token'] = botify_token

# Retrieve the token
botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
```

- Remove any references to `os.environ`, `dotenv`, `load_dotenv`, `set_key`, and `unset_key`.

#### **3. Implement Authentication and User Management**

- Create routes for setting and deleting the Botify API token.

**Set Token Route:**

```python
@rt('/set_token', methods=['POST'])
async def set_token(botify_token: str):
    db['botify_token'] = botify_token
    # Verify the token by fetching the user profile
    user_profile = get_user_profile(botify_token)
    if user_profile:
        username = user_profile.get('data', {}).get('username', 'User')
        db['username'] = username
        return Div(P(f"Welcome, {username}! Token set successfully. Redirecting..."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
    else:
        return Div(P("Invalid Botify Token. Please try again."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
```

**Delete Token Route:**

```python
@rt('/delete_token', methods=['POST'])
async def delete_token():
    db['botify_token'] = None
    db['username'] = None
    return Div(P("Token deleted successfully. Redirecting..."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
```

#### **4. Implement Project and Analysis Management**

- Create routes for updating the project URL and loading configurations.

**Update Project URL Route:**

```python
@rt('/update_project_url', methods=['POST'])
async def update_project_url(project_url: str):
    org_project = extract_org_project(project_url)
    if org_project:
        org, project = org_project
        db['org'] = org
        db['project'] = project
        # Fetch analysis slugs
        botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
        analysis_slugs = fetch_analysis_slugs(botify_token, org, project)
        if analysis_slugs:
            db['analysis_slugs'] = analysis_slugs
            db['selected_slug'] = analysis_slugs[0]
            return Div(P(f"Project set to: {org} / {project}."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
        else:
            return P("No analysis slugs found for this project.")
    else:
        return P("Invalid project URL format.")
```

**Helper Functions:**

Implement `extract_org_project`, `fetch_analysis_slugs`, and `get_user_profile` using synchronous `requests` library.

#### **5. Port Link Graph Generation**

- Replace `aiohttp` with synchronous `requests` in the link graph generation process.
- Use the standard `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the Botify API.

**Link Graph Generation Route:**

```python
@rt('/generate_link_graph', methods=['POST'])
def generate_link_graph():
    org = db.get('org')
    project = db.get('project')
    selected_slug = db.get('selected_slug')
    botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Token {botify_token}'}
    
    # Implement the link graph generation logic synchronously
    # Use requests.post and requests.get where necessary
    # Save the generated CSV file to the 'downloads' directory

    return P("Link graph generated successfully.")
```

#### **6. Replace SSE and ZMQ with WebSockets**

- Remove all references to ZMQ and SSE from `server.py`.
- Use the WebSocket support in `pipulate.py` to stream real-time updates.

**WebSocket Route:**

```python
@app.ws('/ws', conn=on_conn, disconn=on_disconn)
async def ws(msg: str):
    # Handle incoming messages
    if msg == 'start_link_graph_generation':
        # Start the link graph generation process
        # Stream updates to the client using WebSocket connections
        # Use async functions and await as necessary
        pass
```

**Update on_conn Function:**

```python
async def on_conn(ws, send):
    users[str(id(ws))] = send
    # Send initial status to the connected user
    await send(Div("Connected to the server.", id='status', cls='fade-in'))
```

#### **7. Adapt File Management**

- Use FastHTML's routing to serve files from the 'downloads' directory.

**File Download Route:**

```python
@rt('/download/{filename}')
def download_file(filename: str):
    file_path = Path('downloads') / filename
    if file_path.exists():
        return FileResponse(str(file_path), filename=filename)
    else:
        return PlainTextResponse("File not found.", status_code=404)
```

#### **8. Update User Interface**

- Recreate UI components from `server.py` using FastHTML elements.
- Integrate them into the existing layout in `pipulate.py`.

**Main Interface Route:**

Modify the `get` route to include the new UI components.

```python
@rt('/')
def get(request):
    # Check if the Botify token is set
    botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
    if botify_token:
        # Display user profile and project selection
        username = db.get('username', 'User')
        org = db.get('org')
        project = db.get('project')
        selected_slug = db.get('selected_slug')
        # Build the interface using FastHTML elements
        content = Div(
            P(f"Welcome, {username}!"),
            # Add forms and buttons for project and analysis selection
            # Use the patterns from pipulate.py
        )
    else:
        # Display token input form
        content = Form(
            Label("Enter Botify Token:"),
            Input(type='password', name='botify_token'),
            Button("Submit", type='submit'),
            hx_post='/set_token',
            hx_target='body',
            hx_swap='outerHTML',
        )
    return Titled("Botifython", content)
```

#### **9. Remove Unnecessary Dependencies**

- Remove imports for `dotenv`, `aiohttp`, `zmq`, `watchdog`, and any other unnecessary libraries.
- Ensure all functionality uses standard libraries or FastHTML methods.

**Removed Imports:**

```python
# Remove these imports
import aiohttp
import zmq.asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv, set_key, unset_key
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
from watchdog.observers import Observer
```

#### **10. Adjust Logging and Error Handling**

- Use the logging mechanism from `pipulate.py` if needed.
- Ensure error handling is consistent with the methods used in `pipulate.py`.

---

### **Potential Challenges and Solutions**

1. **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Code:**
   - **Challenge:** `server.py` uses asynchronous code (`asyncio`, `aiohttp`), while `pipulate.py` primarily uses synchronous code.
   - **Solution:** Replace asynchronous HTTP requests with synchronous ones using the `requests` library. Use `asyncio` only where necessary for WebSocket communication.

2. **Real-Time Updates Without ZMQ and SSE:**
   - **Challenge:** Need to provide real-time updates during long-running processes without ZMQ and SSE.
   - **Solution:** Use WebSockets provided by FastHTML to stream updates to the client. Implement a mechanism to send periodic status updates over the WebSocket connection.

3. **Dependency on External Services:**
   - **Challenge:** The link graph generation process relies on external APIs (Botify).
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the API interactions are robust, with proper error handling and retries if necessary.

4. **User Interface Complexity:**
   - **Challenge:** Recreating the dynamic UI components from `server.py` using FastHTML.
   - **Solution:** Break down the UI into smaller components and recreate them using FastHTML's idiomatic HTML generation. Use examples from `pipulate.py` for guidance.

5. **File Serving and Security:**
   - **Challenge:** Serving files securely without exposing the server to directory traversal attacks.
   - **Solution:** Sanitize file paths and use FastHTML's routing to control access to the files.

---

### **Testing and Validation**

- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for each new function, especially those interacting with the Botify API.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the application as a whole to ensure that components work together.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Simulate user interactions to verify that the UI behaves as expected.

---

### **Final Notes**

- **Documentation:** Update comments and documentation throughout the code to reflect changes and new functionality.
- **Modularity:** Keep the code modular to facilitate future enhancements and maintenance.
- **Performance Considerations:** Monitor the performance of the application, especially during long-running processes, and optimize as necessary.

---

### **Summary**

By following this plan, we will integrate the functionality of `server.py` into `pipulate.py`, resulting in `botifython.py`. The new application will:

- Use `DictLikeDB` for persistent data storage, avoiding environment variables.
- Reduce external dependencies by using standard libraries and FastHTML methods.
- Provide real-time updates using WebSockets instead of ZMQ and SSE.
- Maintain a consistent user interface and coding style as demonstrated in `pipulate.py`.

This approach aligns with the goal of adhering to the FastHTML methodology and creating a robust, maintainable application.

Excellent, thank you! We must keep the dependencies on the Botify API. This is
designed to be a proprietary fork of Pipulate using Botify. Also, visualizing
the link graph still goes through Cosmograph. Please as the next step, break out
the next level of instructions you would provide, giving precise step by step
instructions, again showing lots of code examples. Structure in the format of
"In `server.py` you do this. In `pipulate.py` you do that. So do the following
in `botifython.py`. Go on with such instruction for as long as you can, giving
the maximum consideration and thoughtfulness to each step as you can. Please and
thank you!

ChatGPT o1-Preview: **Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions for Integrating `server.py` into `botifython.py`**

---

**Objective:** Integrate the functionality of `server.py` into `botifython.py`, which is based on `pipulate.py`. The integration should follow the FastHTML methodology, minimize external dependencies, and use `DictLikeDB` for persistence instead of environment variables.

---

### **1. Set Up `botifython.py`**

**In `server.py`:**

- The server is set up with various imports, including external dependencies like `aiohttp`, `zmq`, and `dotenv`.
- The application uses asynchronous programming and relies on environment variables.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- The application is set up using `fast_app()` from `fasthtml.common`.
- Routes are defined using the `@rt` decorator.
- Uses synchronous code and minimizes external dependencies.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Start by creating a new file `botifython.py` based on `pipulate.py`.
- Copy the contents of `pipulate.py` into `botifython.py`.
- Update the application name and any relevant configurations.

**Code Example:**

```python
# botifython.py

import asyncio
import json
import re
from typing import List, Optional

import requests
from fasthtml.common import *
from starlette.concurrency import run_in_threadpool
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# *******************************
# Application Name and Configuration
# *******************************
APP_NAME = "Botifython"

# Initialize conversation with a system message
conversation = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are Botifython, an AI assistant for Botify users."
    },
]

# Additional configurations can be added here
```

---

### **2. Replace Environment Variables with `DictLikeDB`**

**In `server.py`:**

- Uses environment variables to store the Botify API token.
- Employs `dotenv` to manage `.env` files.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Uses a `DictLikeDB` class to handle persistent key-value storage.
- Avoids environment variables and external dependencies.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Use `DictLikeDB` to store persistent data, including the Botify API token.
- Remove any references to `dotenv` and environment variables.
- Ensure `DictLikeDB` is properly initialized and used throughout the application.

**Code Example:**

First, ensure the `DictLikeDB` class is defined (if not already):

```python
# *******************************
# DictLikeDB Persistence Convenience Wrapper
# *******************************
class DictLikeDB:
    """A wrapper class for a dictionary-like database to simplify access."""
    
    def __init__(self, store, Store):
        self.store = store  # Store reference
        self.Store = Store  # Store class reference

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        """Retrieve an item from the store by key."""
        try:
            return self.store[key].value  # Return the value associated with the key
        except NotFoundError:
            raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if not found

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        """Set an item in the store by key."""
        try:
            # Try to update existing item
            self.store.update({"key": key, "value": value})
        except NotFoundError:
            # If it doesn't exist, insert a new item
            self.store.insert({"key": key, "value": value})

    def __delitem__(self, key):
        """Delete an item from the store by key."""
        try:
            self.store.delete(key)  # Delete the item
        except NotFoundError:
            raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if not found

    def __contains__(self, key):
        """Check if a key exists in the store."""
        return key in self.store

    def __iter__(self):
        """Iterate over the keys in the store."""
        for item in self.store():
            yield item.key  # Yield each key

    def items(self):
        """Return key-value pairs in the store."""
        for item in self.store():
            yield item.key, item.value  # Yield key-value pairs

    def keys(self):
        """Return a list of keys in the store."""
        return list(self)

    def values(self):
        """Return values in the store."""
        for item in self.store():
            yield item.value  # Yield each value

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        """Get an item from the store, returning default if not found."""
        try:
            return self[key]  # Attempt to retrieve the item
        except KeyError:
            return default  # Return default if not found

# Create the wrapper after initializing the application
app, rt, (store, Store) = fast_app(
    "data/botifython.db",  # Specify a new database file for botifython
    ws_hdr=True,
    live=True,
    store={
        "key": str,
        "value": str,
        "pk": "key"
    },
    # Add other tables if necessary
)

db = DictLikeDB(store, Store)
```

### **3. Implement Authentication and User Management**

**In `server.py`:**

- Handles setting and deleting the Botify API token using environment variables.
- Uses routes `/set_token` and `/delete_token`.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Defines routes using the `@rt` decorator.
- Uses forms and database interactions for managing data.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Create routes to set and delete the Botify API token.
- Use `DictLikeDB` to store the token.
- Implement forms for user interaction.
- Verify the token by fetching the user profile from the Botify API.

**Code Examples:**

**Set Token Route:**

```python
@rt('/set_token', methods=['POST'])
async def set_token(botify_token: str):
    db['botify_token'] = botify_token  # Store the token in DictLikeDB
    
    # Verify the token by fetching the user profile
    user_profile = get_user_profile(botify_token)
    if user_profile:
        username = user_profile.get('data', {}).get('username', 'User')
        db['username'] = username
        return Div(P(f"Welcome, {username}! Token set successfully. Redirecting..."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
    else:
        return Div(P("Invalid Botify Token. Please try again."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
```

**Delete Token Route:**

```python
@rt('/delete_token', methods=['POST'])
async def delete_token():
    # Remove the token and username from the database
    db['botify_token'] = None
    db['username'] = None
    return Div(P("Token deleted successfully. Redirecting..."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
```

**User Profile Fetching Function:**

```python
def get_user_profile(botify_token: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Token {botify_token}'}
    try:
        response = requests.get('https://api.botify.com/v1/authentication/profile', headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching user profile: {e}")
        return None
```

**Update the Main Route to Handle Token State:**

```python
@rt('/')
def index():
    botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
    if botify_token:
        # User is authenticated
        username = db.get('username', 'User')
        return Titled(
            "Botifython",
            Div(
                P(f"Welcome, {username}!"),
                A("Logout", href="#", onclick="fetch('/delete_token', {method: 'POST'}).then(() => location.reload());"),
                # Include additional authenticated content here
            )
        )
    else:
        # User needs to enter token
        return Titled(
            "Botifython",
            Div(
                Form(
                    Label("Enter your Botify Token:"),
                    Input(type='password', name='botify_token'),
                    Button("Submit", type='submit'),
                    hx_post='/set_token',
                    hx_target='body',
                    hx_swap='outerHTML',
                )
            )
        )
```

---

### **4. Implement Project and Analysis Management**

**In `server.py`:**

- Manages projects and analysis slugs via routes and form submissions.
- Stores the project URL, organization, and project names.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Uses routes and form submissions to manage data.
- Employs `DictLikeDB` for persistent storage.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Create routes to handle updating the project URL and selecting analysis slugs.
- Store the project information in `DictLikeDB`.
- Use forms to capture user input.

**Code Examples:**

**Update Project URL Route:**

```python
@rt('/update_project_url', methods=['POST'])
async def update_project_url(project_url: str):
    org_project = extract_org_project(project_url)
    if org_project:
        org, project = org_project
        db['org'] = org
        db['project'] = project
        
        # Fetch analysis slugs
        botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
        analysis_slugs = fetch_analysis_slugs(botify_token, org, project)
        if analysis_slugs:
            db['analysis_slugs'] = analysis_slugs
            db['selected_slug'] = analysis_slugs[0]  # Default to the first slug
            return Div(
                P(f"Project set to: {org} / {project}."),
                Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);")
            )
        else:
            return P("No analysis slugs found for this project.")
    else:
        return P("Invalid project URL format.")
```

**Select Analysis Slug Route:**

```python
@rt('/update_selected_slug', methods=['POST'])
async def update_selected_slug(selected_slug: str):
    db['selected_slug'] = selected_slug
    return Div(
        P(f"Analysis slug set to: {selected_slug}."),
        Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);")
    )
```

**Helper Functions:**

```python
def extract_org_project(url: str) -> Optional[tuple]:
    match = re.match(r"https://app\.botify\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/?", url)
    if match:
        org = match.group(1)
        project = match.group(2)
        return org, project
    return None

def fetch_analysis_slugs(botify_token: str, org: str, project: str) -> List[str]:
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Token {botify_token}'}
    url = f"https://api.botify.com/v1/analyses/{org}/{project}/light"
    slugs = []
    while url:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            break
        data = response.json()
        slugs.extend([analysis['slug'] for analysis in data.get('results', [])])
        url = data.get('next')
    return slugs
```

**Update the Main Route to Include Project and Analysis Selection:**

```python
@rt('/')
def index():
    botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
    if botify_token:
        username = db.get('username', 'User')
        org = db.get('org')
        project = db.get('project')
        analysis_slugs = db.get('analysis_slugs', [])
        selected_slug = db.get('selected_slug')
        
        # Build the interface using FastHTML elements
        content = Div(
            P(f"Welcome, {username}!"),
            A("Logout", href="#", onclick="fetch('/delete_token', {method: 'POST'}).then(() => location.reload());"),
            Form(
                Label("Enter Botify Project URL:"),
                Input(type='text', name='project_url', value=f"https://app.botify.com/{org}/{project}/" if org and project else ''),
                Button("Set Project", type='submit'),
                hx_post='/update_project_url',
                hx_target='body',
                hx_swap='outerHTML',
            ),
            Div(
                P(f"Current Project: {org} / {project}") if org and project else "",
                Form(
                    Label("Select Analysis Slug:"),
                    Select(
                        *[Option(slug, selected=(slug == selected_slug)) for slug in analysis_slugs],
                        name='selected_slug'
                    ),
                    Button("Set Analysis Slug", type='submit'),
                    hx_post='/update_selected_slug',
                    hx_target='body',
                    hx_swap='outerHTML',
                ) if analysis_slugs else "",
            )
        )
        return Titled("Botifython", content)
    else:
        # User needs to enter token
        return Titled(
            "Botifython",
            Div(
                Form(
                    Label("Enter your Botify Token:"),
                    Input(type='password', name='botify_token'),
                    Button("Submit", type='submit'),
                    hx_post='/set_token',
                    hx_target='body',
                    hx_swap='outerHTML',
                )
            )
        )
```

### **5. Implement Link Graph Generation**

**In `server.py`:**

- Uses asynchronous code and `aiohttp` to generate link graphs.
- Employs SSE and ZMQ for real-time status updates.
- Downloads and processes CSV files.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Uses synchronous code and the `requests` library.
- Uses built-in WebSocket support for real-time communication.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Port the link graph generation process, replacing `aiohttp` with `requests`.
- Use synchronous requests and avoid external dependencies.
- Use WebSockets to send real-time updates to the client.
- Implement file handling using standard libraries.

**Code Examples:**

**Link Graph Generation Route:**

First, define a route to start the generation process:

```python
@rt('/generate_link_graph', methods=['POST'])
def generate_link_graph():
    # Start the generation process in a separate thread or process
    # For simplicity, we'll use threading here
    from threading import Thread
    thread = Thread(target=generate_link_graph_process)
    thread.start()
    return Div(
        P("Link graph generation started. Check the status below."),
        Div(id='status')
    )
```

**Link Graph Generation Process Function:**

```python
def generate_link_graph_process():
    org = db.get('org')
    project = db.get('project')
    analysis = db.get('selected_slug')
    botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Token {botify_token}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    
    # Send initial status
    update_status("Starting link graph generation...")
    
    # Choose depth
    chosen_depth = 1
    previous_edges = 0
    for depth in range(1, 10):
        update_status(f"Checking depth {depth}...")
        data_payload = {

        data = response.json()
        edges = data['results'][0]['metrics'][0]
        if edges > 1000000 or edges == previous_edges:
            chosen_depth = depth - 1
            break
        previous_edges = edges

    update_status(f"Chosen depth: {chosen_depth}")

    export_job_details = response.json()
    job_url = f"https://api.botify.com{export_job_details.get('job_url')}"

    # Polling for job completion
    for _ in range(300):
        response = requests.get(job_url, headers=headers)
        job_status_details = response.json()
        if job_status_details['job_status'] == 'DONE':
            download_url = job_status_details['results']['download_url']
            # Download the file
            save_as_filename = f"downloads/{org}_{project}_{analysis}_linkgraph_depth-{chosen_depth}.csv"
            download_file(download_url, save_as_filename)
            update_status("Link graph generated successfully.")
            break
        elif job_status_details['job_status'] == 'FAILED':
            update_status("Export job failed.")
            break
        time.sleep(3)
    else:
        update_status("Unable to complete download attempts successfully.")
```

**Status Update Function Using WebSockets:**

```python
def update_status(message: str):
    # Send the status message to connected WebSocket clients
    for user in users.values():
        asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
            user(Div(message, id='status')),
            asyncio.get_event_loop()
        )
```

**WebSocket Setup:**

```python
# WebSocket users
users = {}

async def on_conn(ws, send):
    users[str(id(ws))] = send

def on_disconn(ws):
    users.pop(str(id(ws)), None)

@app.ws('/ws', conn=on_conn, disconn=on_disconn)
async def ws(msg: str):
    pass  # Handle incoming messages if necessary
```

**Update the Client-Side Code to Handle WebSocket Messages:**

Include a script in the main page to establish a WebSocket connection:

```python
Script("""
    var ws = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.host + '/ws');
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = event.data;
    };
""")
```

**Note:** In this setup, the `update_status` function sends messages to all connected WebSocket clients. Ensure proper synchronization and thread safety when interacting with the event loop.

---

### **6. Adapt File Management**

**In `server.py`:**

- Serves generated CSV files via routes like `/download/{filename}`.
- Handles file downloads securely.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Uses `@rt` decorator to define routes.
- Handles file serving using `FileResponse`.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Define routes to serve generated files.
- Ensure files are served securely and safely.

**Code Example:**

**File Download Route:**

```python
from starlette.responses import FileResponse, PlainTextResponse

@rt('/download/{filename}')
def download_file(filename: str):
    import os
    from pathlib import Path
    file_path = Path('downloads') / os.path.basename(filename)
    if file_path.exists():
        return FileResponse(str(file_path), filename=file_path.name)
    else:
        return PlainTextResponse("File not found.", status_code=404)
```

**Ensure Filename Safety:**

- Use `os.path.basename` to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Only allow files from the `downloads` directory to be served.

---

### **7. Integrate Ollama AI Responses**

**In `server.py`:**

- Uses the `ollama_prompt` function to get AI-generated responses.
- Interacts with the Ollama AI server.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Implements `chat_with_ollama` function to interact with the Ollama AI server.
- Uses this for chat functionality.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Ensure the `ollama_prompt` or equivalent function is included.
- Use the existing methods in `pipulate.py` for AI interaction.
- Integrate AI responses where appropriate.

**Code Example:**

**Define the AI Interaction Function:**

```python
def chat_with_ollama(model: str, messages: list) -> str:
    url = "http://localhost:11434/api/chat"
    payload = {
        "model": model,
        "messages": messages,
        "stream": False,
    }
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

    try:
        response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()['message']['content']
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Error communicating with Ollama: {e}")
        return "I'm having trouble processing that request right now."
```

**Use the AI Function in Responses:**

For example, when the user logs in or sets a project, you can generate an AI response:

```python
@rt('/set_token', methods=['POST'])
async def set_token(botify_token: str):
    db['botify_token'] = botify_token
    user_profile = get_user_profile(botify_token)
    if user_profile:
        username = user_profile.get('data', {}).get('username', 'User')
        db['username'] = username
        
        # Generate an AI welcome message
        ai_response = chat_with_ollama('llama3.2', [
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Welcome {username} to Botifython!"}
        ])
        
        return Div(
            P(f"Welcome, {username}!"),
            P(ai_response),
            Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);")
        )
    else:
        return Div(P("Invalid Botify Token. Please try again."), Script("setTimeout(() => window.location.href = '/', 2000);"))
```

---

### **8. Update the User Interface**

**In `server.py`:**

- Uses HTML templates and HTMX for dynamic content.
- Provides forms and buttons for user interactions.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Uses FastHTML elements to build the UI.
- Defines navigation menus and content areas.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Recreate UI components using FastHTML's idiomatic HTML generation.
- Integrate the Botify-specific functionality into the existing layout.
- Use the menu and navigation patterns from `pipulate.py`.

**Code Example:**

**Update the Main Route with Enhanced UI:**

```python
@rt('/')
def index():
    botify_token = db.get('botify_token')
    if botify_token:
        username = db.get('username', 'User')
        org = db.get('org')
        project = db.get('project')
        analysis_slugs = db.get('analysis_slugs', [])
        selected_slug = db.get('selected_slug')
        
        nav = create_nav_menu()
        
        content = Div(
            nav,
            Container(
                P(f"Welcome, {username}!"),
                A("Logout", href="#", onclick="fetch('/delete_token', {method: 'POST'}).then(() => location.reload());"),
                Form(
                    Label("Enter Botify Project URL:"),
                    Input(type='text', name='project_url', value=f"https://app.botify.com/{org}/{project}/" if org and project else ''),
                    Button("Set Project", type='submit'),
                    hx_post='/update_project_url',
                    hx_target='body',
                    hx_swap='outerHTML',
                ),
                Div(
                    P(f"Current Project: {org} / {project}") if org and project else "",
                    Form(
                        Label("Select Analysis Slug:"),
                        Select(
                            *[Option(slug, selected=(slug == selected_slug)) for slug in analysis_slugs],
                            name='selected_slug'
                        ),
                        Button("Set Analysis Slug", type='submit'),
                        hx_post='/update_selected_slug',
                        hx_target='body',
                        hx_swap='outerHTML',
                    ) if analysis_slugs else "",
                ),
                Button("Generate Link Graph", onclick="startLinkGraphGeneration()") if selected_slug else "",
                Div(id='status'),
            )
        )
        
        # Include JavaScript for WebSocket and starting the link graph generation
        scripts = Script("""
            function startLinkGraphGeneration() {
                fetch('/generate_link_graph', {method: 'POST'})
                .then(response => response.text())
                .then(html => {
                    document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = html;
                });
            }
            
            var ws = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.host + '/ws');
            ws.onmessage = function(event) {
                document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = event.data;
            };
        """)
        
        return Titled("Botifython", content, scripts)
    else:
        # User needs to enter token
        return Titled(
            "Botifython",
            Div(
                Form(
                    Label("Enter your Botify Token:"),
                    Input(type='password', name='botify_token'),
                    Button("Submit", type='submit'),
                    hx_post='/set_token',
                    hx_target='body',
                    hx_swap='outerHTML',
                )
            )
        )
```

**Create Navigation Menu Function:**

```python
def create_nav_menu():
    # Create navigation menu similar to pipulate.py
    nav_items = []
    nav_items.append(A("Home", href="/"))
    if db.get('botify_token'):
        nav_items.append(A("Projects", href="#", onclick="fetch('/projects').then(response => response.text()).then(html => { document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = html; });"))
        nav_items.append(A("Analysis", href="#", onclick="fetch('/analysis').then(response => response.text()).then(html => { document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = html; });"))
    nav = Nav(*nav_items)
    return nav
```

**Ensure Consistency with FastHTML Patterns:**

- Use `Div`, `Form`, `Input`, `Button`, `P`, and other FastHTML elements to build the UI.
- Handle user interactions with appropriate `hx_post`, `hx_get`, and JavaScript functions.

---

### **9. Reduce External Dependencies**

**In `server.py`:**

- Uses external libraries like `dotenv`, `aiohttp`, `zmq`, `watchdog`.

**In `pipulate.py`:**

- Minimizes dependencies, relying on standard libraries and FastHTML.

**So in `botifython.py`:**

- Remove imports and usages of unnecessary external libraries.
- Ensure that all functionality can be achieved with standard libraries and FastHTML.

**Code Changes:**

- Remove imports:

```python
# Remove these imports
# import aiohttp
# import zmq.asyncio
# from dotenv import load_dotenv, set_key, unset_key
# from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
# from watchdog.observers import Observer
```

- Replace `aiohttp` with `requests`.
- Use threading or `asyncio` as appropriate for concurrency.
- Ensure that all features are supported without external dependencies.

---

### **10. Testing and Validation**

- Test each component after implementation.
- Ensure that the Botify API interactions work correctly.
- Verify that the token is stored and retrieved properly.
- Test the link graph generation process.
- Check that WebSocket communications are functioning and updates are received by the client.
- Ensure file downloads work and files are served securely.
- Validate that the AI responses are generated and displayed as expected.
- Perform user acceptance testing to ensure the UI is intuitive and responsive.

---

**Final Notes:**

- Throughout the integration, make sure to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Keep the code modular to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.
- Document the code with comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
- Use logging to track the application's behavior and to aid in debugging.
- Ensure that any sensitive information (like API tokens) is handled securely and not exposed.

By following these detailed steps and code examples, you can successfully integrate the functionality from `server.py` into `botifython.py`, adhering to the FastHTML methodology and minimizing external dependencies. The new application will maintain the essential features of `server.py` while benefiting from the streamlined structure and patterns established in `pipulate.py`.
