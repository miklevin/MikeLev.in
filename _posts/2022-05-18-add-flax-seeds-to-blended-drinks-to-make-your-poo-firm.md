I'm making the blended drinks almost every day now. I just made one for Nat and
me. It's really delicious. I put a lot of spinach and flax seed in them to get
the vegetables, iron and water soluble fiber. I said in the video that the flax
seeds take care of the one thing wrong with these drinks by making your poo
firm. That's only half-true. The other thing wrong with these drinks is the
flatulence. What can I add for that?
