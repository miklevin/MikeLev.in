Well, that's a pretty strong start with using ChatGPT to help me visualize the
future. Vision and revision! AI fills in a lot of the story-telling parts that
are not my strength. It won't be long before it does the same with video
editing through Python libraries. Be ready! Be right there doing the
experiments.

As things move from the kooky fringes to the mainstream, I will not only help
people see the significance, but also equip them to actually use the stuff!
It's as if Mickey's Sorcerer's Apprentice enthusiastically tried to teach
Mickey the spells instead of scolding and being all old-guy harumpff about it.

Is ChatGPT really a game-changer like people are saying? I'm here testing it
out just in case, because you've really got to judge the stuff behind the hype
for yourself. Have an open mind. Don't write it off as immediately detectable
spam that Google's going to have to get into an arms race over. There's more to
it than that.

The problem is that I fancy myself as creative and I resent the fact that
ChatGPT can do things fast and easy that are difficult for me. This cohesive
story, hitting all the elements that ironically enough "connect" with people,
is what I'm not good at. Articulating the Hero's Journey enough so that other
people even realize that's what they're witnessing. ChatGPT does it better than
me based on my quick experiments so far, for sure.

Okay, Elder SEO Mike Levin from NYC, go about your day as you really wish to.
Get your place in very nice shape for the kid coming over. I'll probably pick
them up soon an they'll stay until tomorrow night.

Absorb your lessons while you clean. Come back and update your notes here in
this post as you go. Things are changing. Crossroads are approaching. The
better prepared you are, the better the "second half" of your life will go. I'm
in my early fifties and everything so far has been like taking a deep breath
and getting ready. I haven't even really started yet. I'm just starting to
connect the dots. And those dots are:

- First of all, it's never too late.
- Second of all, you've never lost too much.
- Thirdly, you must tend to your mind like a garden.

It took me a long time to realize, garbage in, garbage out. Also, the
metaphors:

- What's most broken?
- Where do you get the biggest bang for the buck?
- What plates need spinning?

And always the mention of rabbit holes, being able to detect them, being able
to back out of them when they turn out too deep (or dangerous).

The first and arguably largest part of life is almost exclusively exploratory,
collecting knowledge, experience, abilities and wisdom. Going down a lot of
rabbit holes. It's the first half of the explore/exploit algorithm, though that
word exploit cold be better. I'm only just making the conscious decision to
switch from the explore way of living life to the exploit way of living life,
but perhaps we should call it the "applying what you've learned" way of life.

ChatGPT is factoring into this transition, interestingly.

Get the most out of ChatGPT now while it's free. I'm in a unique position to
push out a lot in my blog here and get my thoughts together, basically with the
help of an AI.

Wow, I just tried to get ChatGPT to tell me the story about the suppression of
Free Energy and Antigravity and it was slow getting started, but then started
to tell me a story which abruptly stopped in the middle, seeming to hang up.
Then subsequent tries told me that it didn't know anything about it, LOL!

I can "feel" the new rules of the game settling in. There's LOTS of
voice-suppression now, thanks I believe in part to better sentiment analysis
possible through machine learning. There's a better "feel" for what quality is,
and a similar better feel for what noise is so the engines can tweak things
for a bitter signal-to-noise ratio.

I want to throw in figuring out the unknown unknowns here. I don't talk about
it a lot, but the known/unknown 4-quadrant grid is a great tool for
self-examination, figuring out (humbly coming to grips with) quite how much
falls into that quadrant of unknown unknowns. We're all a lot dumber than we
think. The Dunning-Kruger effect.

All this Linux, Python, vim & git stuff needs to be pushed to the unconscious
and automatic quadrant of things we don't know we know. Many things about
Linux, Python, vim and git should be pushed into that quadrant muscle-memory
quadrant. It's like the spoken language or driving.

Most things equal out to a sort of white noise background white static or
radiation sound. I think most things get statistically whitewashed so that
nothing looks more interesting than average. And we can find little treasures
of interest-holding uniqueness within the white noise. Not on average, but
every once in awhile those outliers get organized and creative. Perchance a new
pattern of behavior sets in, and the system is changed forever forward.

AI will surely be one of those things in not too long. These chatbots are
impressive, and it's very interesting to watch them get trained.
