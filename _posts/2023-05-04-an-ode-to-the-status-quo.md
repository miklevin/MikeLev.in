title: An Ode to The Status Quo
headline: I Celebrate The Status Quo and All Its Possibilities
description: I explore the idea of accepting the status quo and not striving for discovery in this ode. I emphasize the importance of practice and the power of repetition. I also caution against the pitfalls of making too much effort and the fallacy of pop culture.

> I will not get discovered  
> And it's not to be lamented;  
> Just practice what you preach   
> Just like how Python is indented.   
>   
> They will not like your reasons  
> Because notions will deface  
> The clutterduck appearance  
> They all love of curly brace.  
>   
> Dig in, do your duty—  
> Just keep doling out dem clues  
> In content they'll ignore  
> But their competitor imbues.   
>   
> Lather, rinse, repeat;  
> With writing, blatantly get gall in,  
> So when you're on a roll there is  
> Some chance it starts snowballing.  
>   
> But it won't so do not sweat it,  
> Find a wave and merely surf it.  
> It'll kill ya if you let it—  
> Don't forget all paths are worth it!  
>   
> I'll enumerate the faux pas  
> Making so much effort fizzle  
> Shedding light on popcultfallacy:  
> It's not steak if there's no sizzle.
