The kid stayed over an extra night. I will be driving them home before the 1:30
call kicks in. It's coming up on 11:00 AM so I should stay on top of it.

Part of putting the love into things is to turn everything into a story. The
story right now is of a 52 year-old dad on his 2nd marriage which is also
falling apart keeping it together enough to keep earning good money and
enjoying what he does, so can pull it all off. But it's a system with small
caches. No big savings. Empty out the resources having made good use of them as
fast as they come in, because settling is stupid. Once you settle, you
stagnate and go stale, spiritually and growth-wise, that is. Some who sweep
such character attributes aside as fufu are probably some pretty empty souls.

But so what? Relativism, am I right? So my next project must be made loveworthy
in order to be playing the game the way I like to play it: enjoying it all the
while. Because if not, what then? Are you living excessively in and for the
past? Or are you living excessively in and for the future? I once thought I was
going to be such a saver, starting early and squirreling it away for a
comfortable retirement. But the reality of my life veered farther and farther
off-course until today when I consider everything worth having internal, and
maybe a hand-full of relationships, none of which are permanent.

Permanency is an illusion, and life adapts. New normals are the always-been
normal. Every generation or two views the world differently--so differently
that the older generations always thing the world's going to hell. However, we
can always generate a new narrative to normalize our own particular time and
place we were put into this world, feeling that our normal today is some static
eternal bliss that'll just keep going.

I'm glad NASA did that asteroid deflection test. Humanity is stepping up to the
challenges before it. People like Elon Musk become forces for good rather than
evil. Entire industries and their dirty old ways can be stared-down and
new-realitied into submission. Reductionist thought can improve almost any
process if someone's willing to front the capital to retool the factories. That
just doesn't happen on too frequent a basis... until now.

We are at or nearing the inflection-point at which new creations can by virtue
of machine-learning, AI (dare I begin using the term) incrementally improving
route everyday procedures bit by bit so that with little more cost than
maintaining the status quo, we will also be improving. Little by little, bit by
bit, better at all things, collectively. Decentralized free and open source
systems should be at the heart of it like mesh networking, else the big
corporations and their stockholders will be their main beneficiaries. If we do
this right, it can be distributed a little more fairly.
