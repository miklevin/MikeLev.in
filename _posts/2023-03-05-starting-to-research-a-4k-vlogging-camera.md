description: I'm researching 4K vlogging cameras and comparing budget, size, weight, and features to decide which one is best. Popular cameras include the Sony RX100 V, Panasonic G85, Sony a6500, and Panasonic Lumix G7. I'm also looking at cameras under $500 with a flip screen, such as the Panasonic Lumix FZ300, Canon EOS M50 Mark II, and Nikon D5600.
