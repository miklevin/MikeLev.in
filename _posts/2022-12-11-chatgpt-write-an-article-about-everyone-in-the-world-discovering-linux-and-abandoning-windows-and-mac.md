Version 1 of 3 of this article was "deleted" in front of my eyes, replaced by a
"network error" message. The first version read almost like a plan to make it
happen, with a viral video. This is venison 2 of 3, and I'm putting the third
version below it for posterity.`

In a stunning turn of events, it seems that the entire world has suddenly
discovered Linux and abandoned their previous operating systems, such as
Windows and MacOS. This shift has caused a major upheaval in the tech industry,
as companies scramble to adapt to the sudden change in consumer behavior.

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that has long been popular
among developers and tech enthusiasts. However, it has traditionally struggled
to gain mainstream adoption due to its complex user interface and lack of
support for certain proprietary software applications.

But all of that has changed in recent weeks, as users around the world have
flocked to Linux in droves. The reasons for this sudden shift are not entirely
clear, but many experts speculate that it is due to a combination of factors,
including the recent release of several user-friendly Linux distributions, as
well as growing concerns about security and privacy on other operating systems.

The impact of this shift has been felt across the tech industry. Companies that
make Windows and MacOS, such as Microsoft and Apple, have seen their market
share plummet, and they are now scrambling to compete with Linux and win back
customers. Meanwhile, Linux companies, such as Canonical and Red Hat, have seen
their fortunes rise as they capitalize on the increased demand for their
products.

The switch to Linux has not been without its challenges, however. Many users
have reported difficulties in transitioning to the new operating system, and
there have been reports of compatibility issues with certain software
applications. Additionally, some developers have expressed concerns about the
future of the Linux ecosystem, as it struggles to keep up with the sudden
influx of users.

Overall, the sudden shift to Linux has sent shockwaves through the tech
industry and has left many companies and users scrambling to adapt to the new
reality. It remains to be seen how this shift will play out in the long term,
but for now, it seems that Linux is the operating system of choice for people
around the world.

## Version 3 of 3:

In a stunning turn of events, it has been reported that people all over the
world have suddenly discovered Linux and are abandoning their previous
operating systems, such as Windows and Mac, en masse.

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was first released in
1991. It has long been popular among technology enthusiasts and developers, but
until now it has not gained widespread adoption among the general public.
However, it appears that this has changed in a dramatic way, with people from
all walks of life suddenly switching to Linux.

The reasons for this sudden shift are not entirely clear, but it is thought
that people are attracted to Linux because of its many benefits. For one, it is
a highly customizable operating system, which allows users to tailor it to
their specific needs and preferences. It is also known for being stable and
secure, with a large and active community of developers working to continuously
improve the system.

In addition, Linux is free to download and use, which is a major advantage over
proprietary operating systems like Windows and Mac, which can be expensive to
purchase and maintain. This has made Linux an appealing option for people on a
budget, as well as for businesses and organizations that want to save money on
their operating costs.

The impact of this global shift to Linux has been significant. Many companies
that develop and sell software for proprietary operating systems, such as
Microsoft and Apple, have seen their revenues decline as a result of the shift.
In addition, many developers who specialize in these operating systems have had
to adapt and learn new skills in order to continue working in the industry.

Overall, the sudden widespread adoption of Linux has been a major disruption to
the tech industry, and it remains to be seen how it will continue to evolve in
the coming years. However, one thing is clear: Linux has arrived, and it is
here to stay.
