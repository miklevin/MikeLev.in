I'm proposing an alternative lifestyle with a science fiction story that starts
modestly on today's tech and builds to a somewhat utopian post-scarcity future.

What I propose here is not for everybody. It opens with the embracing of a
nomadic lifestyle reminiscent of our hunter gatherer tribal past, but
eliminating the harsh, grisly realities of those times. We are not merely
citizens of this particular arbitrary borders or that. Rather, we are citizens
of our planet bound together by the gravity well that holds us here, and our
mortality that forces us to make the best of it. Hell on Earth or Heaven on
Earth? That's up to us.

Settling, planting roots, having a good foundation... good breeding. These are
legacy concepts, promoted by those who managed to control the most valuable at
the time resources. Oceanfront property and real estate in general comes to
mind, as does tribal governance. It's the landlords and the lawyers who run
today's show, in tension with each other and handing power back and forth, at
the expense of the under-opportune and insufficiently motivated masses.

To fix this, the source of lording over one's own autonomy and agency as an
individual must be taken away, period. Peaceful revolution comes from a gradual
shifting of the very rules that underpin the system. The power derived from the
ownership and eminent domain over the land you live on must be diminished,
along with the lack of choice of which laws of the land apply to you. 

The power to vote with your feet must be able to be exercised more readily. To
do so must be a joy and not the chore of uprooting and moving. One of the
benefits of modern technology should be that of forever better aligning
yourself with those you live amongst, and to seek them out and mesh with them
in like-minded communities should be a more love-worthy process of re-rooting.

I propose an alliance of twenty-somethings looking to venture out to experience
life and retirees looking to downsize and enjoy life. There is an overlap where
a luxury recreational vehicle lifestyle could let you take to the road,
gathering in pop-up communities around cheap energy resources, with an emphasis
on embracing ever-improving, ecologically friendly tech.

The rules of economy and methods of sustaining yourself indeed even what means
to be successful, happy or just plain content become open for reinterpretation
in ways similar to the transition from nomadic lifestyles to farming to the
industrial revolution and information age. I propose a way to recapture command
of our own souls and direct our own fates according to our own truer natures.

How often are we born into situations in life where the easy default paths in
life are the ones aligned to our natures? How often do we feel that feeling of
"rightness" in the paths that fall to us based on the randomness of the
situation of our birth? Do you ever feel like you were meant for something more
or that something you hunger for is always beyond reach? That is the feeling of
misalignment. One of your abilities as a human being is to make decisions to
better pursue whatever it is you think is missing in your life.

Harsh realities of prior tribal nomadic lives was not particularly conducive
towards chancing one's dreams such. Someone had to hunt. Someone had to gather.
Roles were meted out even more harshly than they are today. 

With the advent of farming and agriculture, the basic needs of life were more
easily met and the ability to specialize allowed trade, and this allowed
individuals to pursue specialization. If you were good at making weapons, this
could get you out of the hunt. It was safer and you got the satisfaction of
craftsmanship. Watch some videos on flint knapping for a feel of what that
early specialization must have felt like. The value of "internal" skills grew
right along with the control and "ownership" of land.

This creates something of a perpetual tension, as land ownership must be kept
by enforcement, justified by law, and passed down by birthright. This requires
the land owners to recruit the aid of those who have craft skills, but who are
not land owners themselves. The promise of land can be used to tempt and
manipulate and control such skilled workers. And often times it only takes
acquiring their "product" in large quantities to equip less skilled and more
easily manipulated individuals. In other words, raise an army and equip them
with weapons. 

Fast-forward to today. It's basically unchanged. Strong centralized federal
government is the ultimate land-owner and enforcer. Individual land ownership
is an illusion as failing to pay property taxes will get it taken away. You
don't have mineral rights more than a certain distance under the ground, nor
air rights above you. You just pay a lower rate to be a tenant than renters and
can play at being a landlord yourself with subtenants. No assets outside your
body, nothing material, really "belongs" to you in the sense that it can't
easily be taken away. And mortality itself is going to take it all away one day
anyway, shifting the burden of property taxes and such to your descendants.
Need I even talk about inflation and inheritance taxes?

To beat the system, you build internal assets that can always convert to
whatever is being used as money at whatever exchange rate for those services
exist at the time. If you become skilled in the craftsperson sense, you are the
money. The value is inside of you and you get the satisfaction of practicing
craft. It's a win-win and nobody can take it away from you.

These societal and economic concepts are practiced every year at Burning Man. A
pop-up community of cultural experimentalists who come to Burning Man equipped
with whatever they want to trade to get along for the nine days leading up to
Labor Day in the Nevada desert. This is not socialism. This is not capitalism.
It's something more fundamental and primitive, tied to who we are as a species.
The "animal" that became human beings got along, eking out an existence as we
transitioned from nomadic tribes to settled farming to the industrial age.
We've "worn" these different states of being like clothing, and they have not
always been comfortable. None of them to everyone.
