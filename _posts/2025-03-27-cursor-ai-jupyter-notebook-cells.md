title: Can Cursor AI Read Jupyter Notebook Cells?
permalink: /futureproof/cursor-ai-jupyter-notebook-cells/
description: "Driven by the excitement of merging Jupyter's exploratory power with AI assistance inside Cursor, I embarked on a practical investigation, testing the AI's ability to understand notebook context and discovering its significant blind spot: it can't see cell outputs. This prompted a deeper dive using AI research tools (Perplexity, ChatGPT) to confirm the limitation and uncover community workarounds, while also leading me down related paths exploring the reactive notebook alternative Marimo, the awkwardness of Vim mode in cells, and the rich history of computational notebooks from Mathematica to Fernando PÃ©rez's pivotal creation of IPython/Jupyter and its widespread vendor adoption today."

## The Joy of Using Jupyter Notebooks with Cursor AI

I now use Jupyter Notebooks in Cursor AI. Can you imagine the relief? I just
love that slick <span style="color:red; weight: bold;">RED</span> and <span
style="color:green; weight: bold;">GREEN</span> style of AI programming
recommendations pouring down over your code like paint! To have that radically
enabling exploratory environment of a Notebook simultaneously with the radically
enabling assistive power of an AI... well, it's radially enabling!

**Me**: Why hello there, Claude! Nice to see you here in my Jupyter Notebook. Can you see my cell 1?

**Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: &lt;think&gt;
I can see that the user is working with a Jupyter Notebook file named "Untitled.ipynb" in a path that appears to be "pipulate/client/test/". 

The notebook content shown has:
1. One input cell labeled as "in[0]" with the simple code `print("Hello World!")`
2. It looks like the user has not executed the cell yet (otherwise it would typically show output)

The user is asking if I can see their "cell 1". In Jupyter Notebook terminology, cells are typically numbered starting from 0, so what they're showing me is actually cell 0 (labeled as "in[0]"). I only see one cell in the provided content, so I should clarify this in my response.
&lt;/think&gt;

Hello! Yes, I can see your Jupyter Notebook "Untitled.ipynb". I can see cell 0 (labeled as `in[0]`) which contains:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

However, I don't see a cell 1 in the content you've shared. The notebook excerpt you provided only shows a single cell (cell 0) with the "Hello World!" print statement. Is there something specific you'd like help with regarding your notebook?

---

## Cursor AI Can't See Notebook Cell Output

**Me**: Nice! That's a yes. There is no real numbering in the Jupyter UI. That
number between the square brackets you're referring to is the number of times
the cell was executed. So if I ran that "hello world" cell twice and:

`Save And Export Notebook as` / `Executable Script`, it would turn out as:

...the resulting `Untitled.ipynb` would read:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding: utf-8

# In[2]:


print("Hello World!")


# In[ ]:
```

### Understanding Jupyter Cell Execution Counts

...which is not really fixed index cell numbering at all. I'm surprised you
don't know that, Claude. I guess people don't really talk about that kind of
stuff much in the material used to train you.

### Testing Claude's Ability to Parse Jupyter Notebooks

Anyway, I'm really interested in what you see in context here, especially if you
see a distinction between the cells. Do you see this `Unititled.ipynb` like that
Python code I just shared, or in some other way? You're not limited to just
seeing the first cell, are you? Here, let me put a secret word in the second
cell. What's the secret word?

---

## Claude Doesn't Understand `.ipynb` `[1]` Execution Count Brackets

> If you're not familiar with my tech journal style yet, usually the whole
> article thus-far becomes the next prompt, or at least a large enough chunk of
> it to keep the conversation going, drilling-down on whatever it is I'm trying
> to discover -- in this case, how Cursor AI sees Notebooks.

**Claude**: &lt;think&gt;
I made a mistake in my interpretation of Jupyter Notebook cells. You're absolutely right about how Jupyter Notebooks work:

1. The number in `In[n]` represents the execution count (how many times cells have been executed in the session), not a fixed cell index
2. Empty brackets `In[ ]` indicate a cell that hasn't been executed yet
3. When exporting a notebook, these execution counts are preserved in the comments

Looking at your original file again:
```
in[0]: print("Hello World!")

in[1]: # flibbertigibbet
```

I can now see this shows two cells:
1. First cell with execution count 0: `print("Hello World!")`
2. Second cell with execution count 1: `# flibbertigibbet`

The second cell contains just a comment with the word "flibbertigibbet", which appears to be the secret word you're asking about.

I should acknowledge my error and confirm that I can indeed see both cells, including the second cell with the secret word.
&lt;/think&gt;

You're absolutely right, and I appreciate the correction! The numbers in the brackets (`In[n]`) represent execution counts (how many times cells have been executed during a session), not fixed cell indices as I incorrectly stated. That's an important distinction about Jupyter Notebooks that I should have recognized.

Looking at your original notebook excerpt again, I can now see that there are indeed two cells:

1. A cell with execution count 0: `print("Hello World!")`
2. A cell with execution count 1: `# flibbertigibbet`

So to answer your question, the secret word you placed in the second cell is "flibbertigibbet". 

I can see both cells in the context you provided, and I appreciate you testing my ability to properly parse the notebook format!

## Testing Live File Updates Between JupyterLab and Cursor

> If you're using Notebooks in Cursor AI, chances are you have a copy of
> JupyterLab or transitional Jupyter Notebooks running somewhere else on your
> machine, because these VSCode-forks have to get the running kernel from
> somewhere. This is an experiment to see how soon Claude can "see" stuff after

**Me**: That's a big ol' confirmation. I didn't even do that typing in Cursor
AI. I actually did that over in JupyterLab in the browser and saved it, coming
back to Cursor and seeing it dynamically live-loaded back in! And
`Untitled.ipynb` was selected in-context when I asked you that question, so you
must have read if off the drive. Nice!

I just made the 3rd cell. Can you tell me anything about that?

**Claude**: &lt;think&gt;
Let me look at the provided context again:

```pipulate/client/test/Untitled.ipynb
in[0]: print("Hello World!")

in[1]: # flibbertigibbet

in[2]: # Thingamajig
```

Yes, I can see that there's now a third cell with execution count 2 that contains the comment "# Thingamajig". This suggests that the file was updated with a new cell since the previous message, and I'm now seeing this updated version because the file was selected in-context when the user asked the question.
&lt;/think&gt;

Yes! I can see the third cell you've added to your notebook. It has an execution count of 2 (`in[2]`) and contains the comment:

```python
# Thingamajig
```

This confirms that I'm able to see the updated content of your `Untitled.ipynb` file as you modify it externally in JupyterLab and then return to Cursor. It seems the file context is being refreshed, allowing me to access the current state of your notebook file when you ask questions about it. That's quite useful for providing help with notebooks you're actively working on!

### Examining Differences Between Jupyter Notebook Cells

> Can Claude in Cursor AI distinguish between a Jupyter Markdown cell and a code
> execution cell? Their representation in the downloadable executable `.py`
> scripts are very similar. The pattern is hash space hash (`#` `#`) indicating
> markdown. I have to coerce Claude into realizing.

**Me**: Exactly! But do you see anything special about the line containing
flibbertigibbet and the line containing Thingamajig? Given what you know about
Jupyter Notebooks, are there any inferences you might be able to make about what
makes them different, aside from the words themselves?

**Claude**: &lt;think&gt;
Let me carefully examine the two cells:

Cell 1 (execution count 1): `# flibbertigibbet`
Cell 2 (execution count 2): `# Thingamajig`

Both cells start with the `#` character, which in Python indicates a comment. This means neither cell is executing any actual Python code - they're just comment lines.

The main differences I can see:
1. Different execution counts (1 vs 2)
2. Different comment text ("flibbertigibbet" vs "Thingamajig")
3. Capitalization difference - "flibbertigibbet" starts with lowercase, while "Thingamajig" starts with uppercase

In Jupyter Notebooks, comments alone don't produce any visible output when executed. They're simply annotations.

One possible inference is that in the original notebook view, these might appear differently if there were any outputs associated with these cells (which wouldn't be expected for comment-only cells, but it's possible you executed them and they have some execution metadata).

Also, it appears that Cell 2 (Thingamajig) might have additional whitespace after it as there seem to be blank lines after it in the file representation.

I'm not seeing any other significant differences based solely on the representation in the file.
&lt;/think&gt;

Looking at both cells more carefully:

Cell 1 (execution count 1): `# flibbertigibbet`
Cell 2 (execution count 2): `# Thingamajig`

The main difference I notice is that after the "Thingamajig" cell, there appear to be additional empty lines in the notebook. In Jupyter notebooks, these empty lines after a cell can indicate:

1. There might be another cell that hasn't been executed yet (which would show as `In[ ]`)
2. Or simply that you've added some spacing after that cell

Another inference is that both cells contain only comments (they start with `#`), so they wouldn't produce any output when executed. However, they still increment the execution counter when run, which suggests you've executed both of these comment cells despite them not producing visible output.

Is there another distinction between these cells that you're thinking of?

## Claude Will Make Up Stories About Code Execution Order

> If Claude is seeing Jupyter Notebooks how the `.py`-files look when
> downloaded, there's no way it knows your code execution order. It has enough
> information to infer execution-counts. But the order? No way.

**Me**: That is totally incorrect to the point of hallucinating. First of all, I
haven't executed any of the cells other than the first one which I executed
twice. Second of all, when I `Save And Export Notebook as` / `Executable
Script`, the resulting code looks like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding: utf-8

# In[2]:


print("Hello World!")


# In[ ]:


# flibbertigibbet


# # Thingamajig

# In[ ]:
```

...which I'm assuming is a lot like what you're able to see when I put
`Untitled.ipynb` in prompt context. And so, my question to you is looking at the
characters that immediately precede each word, can you tell anything special
about one versus the other? And given what you know of Jupyter Notebooks, can
you tell me what you think that might mean?

**Claude**: &lt;think&gt;
Looking at the full notebook export that you've shared, let me carefully examine the formatting:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding: utf-8

# In[2]:


print("Hello World!")


# In[ ]:


# flibbertigibbet


# # Thingamajig

# In[ ]:
```

Now I see what you're highlighting. The key difference is:

- For "flibbertigibbet": It's preceded by a single `#` character (`# flibbertigibbet`)
- For "Thingamajig": It's preceded by two `#` characters (`# # Thingamajig`)

This is a significant difference in Jupyter notebooks. When a line starts with `#` it's a regular Python comment. But when a line starts with `# #` (or multiple `#`s), it's actually a Markdown cell in Jupyter, not a Python code cell.

So "flibbertigibbet" is in a Python code cell as a comment, while "Thingamajig" is in a Markdown cell. That's why they would look different when rendered in the notebook interface - the Markdown cell would format "Thingamajig" as a heading (since it has a `#` at the beginning of the Markdown content).

This is an important distinction in Jupyter notebooks - code cells vs. Markdown cells. The export format shows this by putting an extra `#` before Markdown content.
&lt;/think&gt;

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my incorrect interpretation. Looking at the exported script you shared, I can now see the critical difference:

- "flibbertigibbet" is preceded by a single `#`: `# flibbertigibbet`
- "Thingamajig" is preceded by `# #`: `# # Thingamajig`

This indicates that "flibbertigibbet" is in a regular Python code cell (with the `#` making it a comment within that code cell), while "Thingamajig" is in a Markdown cell (where the first `#` is Jupyter's way of indicating Markdown content in the exported script, and the second `#` would make it a heading in Markdown).

In Jupyter, this distinction means:
- The "flibbertigibbet" cell would execute as Python (though doing nothing since it's commented)
- The "Thingamajig" cell would render as a Markdown heading when displayed in the notebook

Thank you for pointing out this distinction - it's an important aspect of Jupyter notebooks that I should have recognized from the file format.

## You Don't Know Notebooks, Claude

While these LLMs have been trained on coding, and even by now know quite a bit
about the types of coding environments Curser AI and Windsurf use, they know
very little about actual Notebooks, and their strange REPL code-execution
context. 

But it does appear that they see a text-file representation somewhat similar to
the export of the `.py`-file. The alternative of them getting the whole `.ipynb`
file would be confusing to them resulting in a useless experience for the user.
So it's probably `nbconvert` or something like it there in the process.

Okay, one more test. I need to see if they can see the output cell. This is a
bit of a trick because anything I put in the workspace is readable by Cursor AI,
given VSCode Workspace contexts.

## Testing Claude's Ability to See Jupyter Cell Output

**Me**: Can you see what I just did? And can you see its output?

**Claude**: &lt;think&gt;
Let me look at the recent changes to the file. The most recent state of the file you shared is:

```pipulate/client/test/Untitled.ipynb
in[0]: print("Hello World!")

in[1]: # flibbertigibbet

in[2]: # Thingamajig

in[3]: with open("/home/mike/foo.txt") as fh:
    content = fh.read()

print(content)
```

I can see that you've added a new cell (execution count 3) that:
1. Opens a file at "/home/mike/foo.txt"
2. Reads its content
3. Prints that content

However, I cannot see the output of this cell execution. In a Jupyter notebook, outputs would typically appear after the cell, but the file snippet doesn't show any output. This suggests either:
1. The cell hasn't been executed yet
2. The execution didn't produce any output (perhaps the file doesn't exist)
3. The output exists but wasn't included in the file snippet you shared

I can only see the code you've written, not the actual execution result or output from running this cell.
&lt;/think&gt;

I can see that you've added a new cell (with execution count 3) that contains:

```python
with open("/home/mike/foo.txt") as fh:
    content = fh.read()

print(content)
```

This code attempts to open a file at "/home/mike/foo.txt", read its contents, and print them. However, I cannot see the output of this cell execution in the file you've shared. The snippet only shows the code itself, not any results that would appear after running the cell.

If you've executed this cell, the output would depend on whether that file exists and what its contents are. But that output isn't visible in the context I can access.

### Discovering Cursor AI's Limitations with Jupyter Cell Output

It appears that Cursor AI cannot read the output of Jupyter Cells even if
executed. This is a fascinating and important point, with ramifications from
privacy assurances to rapid feedback-loop limitations. To double check this
finding, I re-executed the cell from within Cursor AI and saved the resulting
`.ipynb` to make the output into the Notebook JSON metadata, and asked Claude
again if it could see the output and it still couldn't. I'm fairly certain
Notebook cell output is not in the AI prompt context.

![Jupyter Notebook Cursor AI](/images/jupyter-notebook-cursor-ai.png)

Let's double-check with Perplexity. 

**Me**: Can Cursor AI read the output of Jupyter Notebook cells?

**Perplexity**: Cursor AI has limited ability to directly read and interpret the output of Jupyter Notebook cells. Here are the key points based on the provided information:

1. **Direct Output Reading**:
   - Cursor AI does not inherently include cell outputs as part of its context when working with Jupyter Notebooks. This means it primarily relies on the code written in the cells rather than their execution results[4][5].
   - There have been feature requests to include cell outputs in the AI's context for better suggestions and analysis, but this functionality is not yet standard[5].

2. **Workarounds**:
   - Users can manually provide outputs to Cursor by printing results or taking screenshots (for visualizations) and uploading them into Cursor's interface. This allows the AI to analyze and generate insights based on the shared outputs[1].
   - For API responses or similar outputs, users can print them to a cell, and Cursor can then process these outputs if explicitly shared[8].

3. **Privacy Concerns**:
   - Since cell outputs may contain sensitive data, there is ongoing discussion about making output inclusion an opt-in feature to address privacy concerns[3][4].

In summary, while Cursor AI can assist with code and provide insights, its ability to directly utilize Jupyter Notebook cell outputs is limited and requires manual intervention or workarounds.

## The Looming Feedback Loop of Autonomous AI Development

For those wondering, there is a strange feedback loop this is on the verge of.
It's not too far off from what Goose AI, Manus and Cline which are all agentic,
meaning they operates autonomously within development environments, doing
whatever buzzword you want to slap on it: self-prompting, chain-of-thought
reasoning, plan/act mode, auto-debugging, recursive self-improvement, autonomous
tool invocation, memory-based task continuity, modular task execution, and
context-aware decision-making, yadda yadda.

### The Promise and Peril of AI Tool Integration

Taking the output of one process and feeding it into the input of another, and
giving individual steps the ability to tool-call with protocols like MCP (model
context protocol). That's what all of this stuff is going, but it's pretty scary
and all the live versions are heavily sandboxed so they can't fubar your
machine. It's no different with these AI-assisted IDEs. You can feel the siren's
song of letting them take the ball and run with it. But a modest first step is
letting it at least see the output of your code ***when you want it to.***

**Me**: Hey ChatGPT 4.5 Deep Research, what are the techniques people are using
today to make the cell output of a Jupyter Notebook in Cursor AI visible to the
code assistant for more rapid feedback loops?

**ChatGPT 4.5**: Could you please clarify whether you're looking for officially
supported techniques from Cursor AI, or also community-driven workarounds and
plugins? And are you specifically focused on making outputs visible for code
assistants *within Cursor*, or would you like comparisons with other AI-enabled
IDEs like Copilot or CodeWhisperer as well?

**Me**: Right now, just in Cursor. And start with the official and if the
results are less than satisfying, fall over to the community-driven workarounds
and plugins.

**ChatGPT 4.5**: Got it. Iâll dig into how people are currently enabling Jupyter Notebook cell outputs to be visible to the code assistant in Cursor AIâstarting with official methods and then falling back to community-driven workarounds, plugins, or hacks if needed.

Iâll report back soon with what I find.

# Integrating Jupyter Notebook Outputs into Cursor AIâs Assistant Context

## Official Support (or Lack Thereof) for Notebook Output in Cursor AI  
Currently, Cursorâs AI code assistant **does not natively include Jupyter Notebook cell outputs in its context**. In practice this means the assistant âignoresâ the printed results, figures, or errors from code cells unless the user explicitly shares them. Multiple users have raised this limitation: *âIt feels as if the notebook outputs are not taken into context for anythingâ* ([Jupyter notebook output not taken into context Â· Issue #2746 Â· getcursor/cursor Â· GitHub](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/2746#:~:text=So%20the%20issue%20is%20simple,cross%20cell%20context%20is%20recognised)). The importance of output context is well recognized â one feature request notes *âthe output of the cells is a very important piece of context for any Cursor featureâ* ([Support notebook cell output inclusion in context - Feature Requests - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/support-notebook-cell-output-inclusion-in-context/28876#:~:text=When%20working%20with%20Jupyter%20notebooks%2C,chat%20format%20would%20be%20great)) â but as of early 2025, **there is no official feature to feed cell outputs into the AIâs prompt automatically**. 

> **Why no built-in support yet?** Two main reasons emerge from official discussions. First, including outputs (which might contain sensitive data like dataset values, API responses, etc.) poses **privacy concerns** if sent to the model. A team member suggested that if output-context were added, it should be **opt-in** due to privacy ([Support notebook cell output inclusion in context - Feature Requests - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/support-notebook-cell-output-inclusion-in-context/28876#:~:text=KirkegaardData%20%20March%203%2C%202025%2C,10%3A30pm%20%202)). Second, technical constraints like context length: large outputs (e.g. a big `df.head()` or Plotly chart) could overflow prompt limits. In fact, users observed that when forcing a whole notebook into chat, **Cursor would truncate lengthy outputs** to avoid huge prompts ([New release completely broke jupyter notebook functionality in cursor chat - Bug Reports - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/new-release-completely-broke-jupyter-notebook-functionality-in-cursor-chat/12705#:~:text=Have%20you%20changed%20how%20the,forget%20about%20an%20inline%20image)). (In one update, inline image outputs started getting included fully, causing âlong fileâ warnings and token bloat ([New release completely broke jupyter notebook functionality in cursor chat - Bug Reports - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/new-release-completely-broke-jupyter-notebook-functionality-in-cursor-chat/12705#:~:text=Have%20you%20changed%20how%20the,forget%20about%20an%20inline%20image)).) In short, **official documentation currently offers no automatic output-sharing**, focusing only on code and markdown content. The Cursor team is aware of the demand â a staff member noted *âthere seems to be a lot of demandâ¦ I can bring up internally what features people want most in notebooksâ* ([Jupyter Notebook support - Page 3 - Feature Requests - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/jupyter-notebook-support/14851?page=3#:~:text=Hey%20everyone%2C%20I%20believe%20there,features%20may%20not%20work%20correctly)) â and many users specifically emphasize that *âbeing able to use cell output as context would be a step change in productivityâ* ([Jupyter Notebook support - Page 3 - Feature Requests - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/jupyter-notebook-support/14851?page=3#:~:text=heydenberk%20%20January%209%2C%202025%2C,9%3A33pm%20%2052)). However, until the developers implement such a feature, users must rely on manual or community-driven solutions.

## Community Workarounds to Expose Execution Outputs to the AI  
In the absence of native support, **Cursorâs user community has devised various workarounds** to incorporate cell outputs into the assistantâs context. These techniques, while not as seamless as a built-in feature, can help the AI âseeâ your results for tighter feedback loops:

- **Manual Copy-Paste of Outputs:** The most straightforward solution is simply copying important outputs (e.g. error tracebacks, DataFrame previews, computed values) and pasting them into the conversation or into a markdown cell. This ensures the assistant can analyze them. Many Cursor users resort to this today â for example, one GitHub issue confirms *âNow I am manually copy[ing] the output, which is a little bit frustrating.â* ([Jupyter notebook output not taken into context Â· Issue #2746 Â· getcursor/cursor Â· GitHub](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/2746#:~:text=VicaYang%20%20%20commented%20,67)). By pasting an output (or a summary of it) into the chat, you make it part of the prompt so the AI can incorporate that information in its next suggestion. This is tedious but effective for things like debugging (pasting stack traces) or data analysis (pasting a few lines of a computation result).

- **Printing or Saving Outputs to a File:** A clever hack is to **redirect outputs to a file that Cursor *can* read**. Instead of relying on the ephemeral notebook output area, you can have your code write results to a `.txt` or markdown file in the workspace. For instance, one user working with an API had the idea to *âwrite the response to `response.txt` and then reference that fileâ* ([Is Cursor aware of API responses? - Discussion - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/is-cursor-aware-of-api-responses/2942#:~:text=Is%20there%20something%20with%20fewer,and%20then%20reference%20that%20file)). Cursorâs assistant can then be prompted to open or consider that fileâs contents. Because the file is part of your project, the assistant can retrieve its text as context (provided itâs not too large) just like any source code. This workaround essentially turns runtime output into a static text that the AI will treat as just another piece of project data. Community members confirm this approach *âcould also workâ* ([Is Cursor aware of API responses? - Discussion - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/is-cursor-aware-of-api-responses/2942#:~:text=Is%20there%20something%20with%20fewer,and%20then%20reference%20that%20file)) for making the AI aware of dynamic results without manual copy-paste each time. Similarly, you could save a DataFrameâs summary to a CSV or markdown table that the assistant can then read and reason about.

- **Leverage Notebook Outputs via Chat Context (Limited):** Some users have experimented with indirectly including outputs by using Cursorâs chat on the notebook file. For example, one forum tip suggested that if you **print the result in a Jupyter cell**, you can then ask the assistant about it, since *âCursor can read the cell outputs and answer questions with that context.â* ([Is Cursor aware of API responses? - Discussion - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/is-cursor-aware-of-api-responses/2942#:~:text=amanrs%20%20February%2017%2C%202024%2C,8%3A16pm%20%202)) In practice this method is hit-or-miss. It appears Cursorâs chat *may* ingest the notebookâs JSON (including output text) when you use certain commands (like inserting the file into chat), but it isnât reliable or complete. As noted, earlier versions would drop large outputs (only partial output from a `df.head()` might appear) ([New release completely broke jupyter notebook functionality in cursor chat - Bug Reports - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/new-release-completely-broke-jupyter-notebook-functionality-in-cursor-chat/12705#:~:text=Have%20you%20changed%20how%20the,forget%20about%20an%20inline%20image)). So while you can try to print concise outputs (say, a small dict or short string) and then use the **Chat** mode on that notebook, be aware the AI might still not âseeâ everything. Essentially, this trick isnât officially supported â itâs more of an accidental capability when using the *âwhole file to chatâ* feature. Small text outputs could get through, but anything lengthy or non-text (images/plots) likely wonât. Use this with caution: it can save a step for small results (avoiding manual copy) but double-check that the assistant actually received the info (you might ask it to echo back what it saw from the output to be sure).

- **Utilizing the Integrated Terminal for Outputs:** An alternate approach is to sidestep the notebook UI for execution and use a **.py script or Cursorâs terminal** to run code, then feed the output to the AI. Cursorâs âAuto Debugâ features work in the terminal context â for example, if you run tests or scripts in the terminal panel and get an error, Cursor can capture that and offer a fix. (This is something users have and want more of â a request exists to *âautoâ¦ add to chat context a Jupyter notebook cell output, similar to whatâs available within the terminalâ* ([terminal support for Jupyter notebook cell outputs Â· Issue #1000 Â· getcursor/cursor Â· GitHub](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/1000#:~:text=Is%20your%20feature%20request%20related,have%20the%20cursor%20terminal%20support)), implying the terminal already had some auto-context injection for its outputs.) So, one strategy is: during development, run code in a script (or use VS Codeâs Python Interactive mode `#%%` in a .py file) so that output appears in a text form (terminal or output pane). Then, either let Cursorâs agent auto-include it if supported, or copy it from there. A few advanced users even configure their workflow such that they **donât let Cursor modify the `.ipynb` directly** â instead, they test code in `.py` files or the terminal, where the AIâs context handling is better, and only later assemble the confirmed code into a notebook. This prevents the AI from getting âconfusedâ by hidden state in notebooks and gives you explicit control over what output to share ([Jupyter Notebook support - Page 3 - Feature Requests - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/jupyter-notebook-support/14851?page=3#:~:text=At%20minimum%2C%20the%20default%20Cursor,it%20aware%20of%20its%20limitations)) ([Jupyter Notebook support - Page 3 - Feature Requests - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/jupyter-notebook-support/14851?page=3#:~:text=A%20little%20tip%20for%20everyone,complete%20ipynb%20with%20validated%20code)). Itâs a bit of a roundabout hack, but it streamlines the feedback loop by using Cursor in an environment where it can see outputs (e.g. error logs in terminal) and then manually merging results back into the notebook.

- **Community Extensions or Patches:** As of now there isnât an official plugin solely for syncing outputs to Cursorâs context, but the community has shown willingness to **patch Cursorâs Jupyter support** in other ways. For example, early adopters solved notebook-run issues by replacing Cursorâs bundled Jupyter extension with the official VS Code Jupyter extension ([[Solved] Jupyter Notebook Support Â· Issue #576 Â· getcursor/cursor Â· GitHub](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/576#:~:text=Here%20is%20a%20possible%20solution%3A,with%20the%20one%20from%20microsoft)). This hack made notebooks usable in Cursor and ensured *âthe AI kn[ows] what [you are] writing in each blockâ* ([[Solved] Jupyter Notebook Support Â· Issue #576 Â· getcursor/cursor Â· GitHub](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/576#:~:text=,jupyter%20extension%20from%20cursor%20marketplace)) (i.e. the assistant sees the code cells). While this fix didnât magically include outputs, it improved overall Jupyter functionality and demonstrated how power users tweak Cursor under the hood. Similarly, one could imagine a custom script or extension that on each cell execution, takes the output and inserts it into a hidden markdown cell or a sidecar text file for the AI â though no public tool has been published yet. For now, most people rely on the simpler manual methods above. 

## Looking Ahead: Ongoing Discussions and Expectations  
The demand for true integration of Jupyter outputs into Cursor AI is loud and clear across forums and GitHub. Dozens of users have upvoted requests to *âsupport notebook cell output inclusion in contextâ* ([Support notebook cell output inclusion in context - Feature Requests - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/support-notebook-cell-output-inclusion-in-context/28876#:~:text=When%20working%20with%20Jupyter%20notebooks%2C,chat%20format%20would%20be%20great)) and to improve the notebook editing experience in general. Cursorâs team has acknowledged these requests and is reportedly prioritizing notebook support enhancements. We can likely expect **future updates** to address this, potentially by allowing opt-in inclusion of outputs. For example, the assistant might in the future offer a toggle or command to grab the latest cell output into the chat (with warnings about data sensitivity). Until then, the **communityâs stopgap solutions** â copying outputs, saving them to files, and creatively structuring oneâs workflow â are the way to go for faster feedback loops. 

In summary, **Cursor AI currently doesnât automatically âseeâ Jupyter cell outputs**, but resourceful users are bridging that gap themselves. By manually feeding important result data back into the prompt (or via intermediate files), you can give the AI the context it needs to provide informed suggestions ([Jupyter notebook output not taken into context Â· Issue #2746 Â· getcursor/cursor Â· GitHub](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/2746#:~:text=VicaYang%20%20%20commented%20,67)) ([Is Cursor aware of API responses? - Discussion - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/is-cursor-aware-of-api-responses/2942#:~:text=Is%20there%20something%20with%20fewer,and%20then%20reference%20that%20file)). Itâs not a perfect solution, but it empowers you to still leverage Cursorâs AI on notebook-based projects. And with the strong community pressure and active discussion on Cursorâs forums, thereâs good reason to hope that a more elegant, official solution (perhaps a Notebook-Output-to-Context feature) will be implemented in the near future.

## Exploring Marimo as a Jupyter Alternative

Wow, okay that was quite a journey. Copy/paste then it is for awhile. But that
was a worthy exploration. Also, I became aware of [Marimo](https://marimo.io/),
an new kind of ***reactive Notebook*** and competitor to Jupyter. Here's the
[Marimo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N6lInzq5MI&t=383s) and the
[FAQ](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo). Wow, gotta learn more about that,
and there is much that sounds like Pipulate, but it suggest packaging it up with
Docker for distribution. 

### Comparing Marimo to Traditional Notebooks

Marimo could end up being an alternative platform distributed with a Pipulate
workflow. Marimo talks about Jupyter Notebooks as web apps, but it's still
exposed Python and all. Their definition of a web app is still actually still a
notebook. And so it doesn't' really do away with the intimidation factor for
non-programmers. It's for the same audience as Notebooks themselves, and not for
a new non-technical user like canned Pipulate workflows.

### Integrating Marimo into the Development Stack

But it still takes development to can Pipualte workflows, and so Marimo can be
side-by-side complementary and an alternative to JupyterLab. I could put it on
its own `start` and `stop` like I do JupyterLab to run locally from within the
same Nix Flake as Pipulate. I basically package Pipulate up with its own Python
webdev environments. You know, I could throw in one of the still
free-as-in-libre VSCode forks like [VSCodium)(https://vscodium.com/) and make it
a really equal opportunity editing environment.

### The Challenges of Vim Mode in Notebooks

And finally as an added in bonus because I really doubt I'll make a separate
article on it, `vim` mode in a Notebook is really awkward, be it in Cursor AI or
a regular web-based JupyterLab Notebook environment. OMG, the mixed contexts. As
much of a vim-head as I am, cells an vim keystrokes don't live together
harmoniously. I mean, what's `Esc` even mean? Nested context modes of Notebook
cells and vim editing? No thank you!

### Managing Vim Mode in Modern IDEs

But now I have to learn how to toggle vim-mode on and off quickly. Finally, I
have a reason to to `Ctrl+Shift P`. You can start typing `Toggle vim mode`,
because the mega-popular vim mode plugin for VSCode, `vscodevim`, which I use
does indeed support toggling on and off vim mode without having to enable and
disable the plugin all the time -- which was my fear.

### Adapting to Vim Keystrokes in Different Contexts

Vim mode is almost just usable when you're editing normal `.py` files in
VSCode/Cursor, and I'm trying to develop that skill. I talk about how timeless
of a muscle memory that is at least in part because every editor and IDE worth
their salt builds-in a vim-mode. So I want to try to practice what I preach. But
I have to admit, vim keystrokes are a challenge.

I'm finally getting used to vim-bindings in Cursor, and I think it's better than
without them, but only barely. And certainly not when editing a Jupyter
Notebook.

### The Historical Evolution of Computational Notebooks

Oh and the last parting shot: ALL Notebooks are Jupyter Notebooks. The vendors
would have you think otherwise, but they're not just some generic thing. There's
a long history of notebooks in general that comes from the ancient world of
academia, but those are Mathe... Mathu... Mathi... uh... Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: Before the advent of Jupyter Notebooks, earlier academic notebooks were primarily specialized tools for mathematics, statistics, and computational science. These early notebooks were introduced in the late 1980s and included platforms such as **Mathematica**, **MathCad**, and **Maple**. Below is an overview of these early tools:

### **1. Mathematica (1988)**
- Introduced by Wolfram Research, Mathematica was one of the first notebook-style interfaces.
- It allowed users to combine code, mathematical computations, visualizations, and explanatory text in a single document.
- Mathematica was highly focused on symbolic mathematics and remained a niche tool for advanced mathematics and physics research[1].

### **2. MathCad**
- MathCad provided an interactive environment for engineering and mathematical calculations.
- Unlike traditional programming environments, it emphasized ease of use with a focus on visualizing equations and results in a readable format.

### **3. Maple**
- Maple, developed by Waterloo Maple (now Maplesoft), was another early computational notebook with a focus on symbolic computation and algebra.
- It was widely used in academia for solving mathematical problems and teaching.

### **Why These Tools Were Niche**
- These early notebooks were tailored to technical audiences, requiring expertise in mathematics or computational science to use effectively.
- They lacked the accessibility and flexibility needed for broader adoption outside specialized fields.
- During this time, spreadsheets like VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, and Excel gained widespread popularity due to their simplicity and versatility for general data manipulation tasks[1].

### **Transition to Modern Notebooks**
The limitations of these early tools laid the groundwork for more accessible platforms like Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter emerged in 2011 as part of the IPython project, offering a browser-based interface that supported multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, R) and integrated code execution with rich text documentation[1][2]. This marked the beginning of a new era where notebooks became central to data science, education, and research across disciplines.

...but then along comes a guy named Fernando PÃ©rez and... Perplexity?

**Perplexity**: Fernando PÃ©rez, a Colombian physicist and software developer, revolutionized interactive computing with the creation of IPython in 2001. Initially developed as a "thesis procrastination project" while PÃ©rez was a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, IPython aimed to simplify scientific workflows by providing an enhanced interactive computing environment for Python users. PÃ©rez sought to replace proprietary tools and streamline his research processes with open-source solutions[1][2][6].

In 2004, PÃ©rez collaborated with Brian Granger to envision a web-based notebook interface for IPython, which eventually evolved into the Jupyter Notebook. Their work culminated in the founding of Project Jupyter in 2014, marking a significant expansion beyond Python to support multiple programming languages like R and Julia[1][5]. Jupyter transformed scientific computing by enabling reproducible research and computational narratives, allowing researchers to combine live code, text, and visualizations seamlessly[3][9].

Today, Fernando PÃ©rez is an associate professor at UC Berkeley's Department of Statistics and serves as Faculty Director at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. His contributions have earned him numerous accolades, including the Free Software Award (2012) and ACM Software System Award (2017)[2][4]. Project Jupyter continues to be a cornerstone of open science, supporting millions of users worldwide[3][9].

## Vendor Adoption and Integration of Jupyter Notebooks

**Me**: And then along came the vendors who know a good tool and FOSS license
when they see one, so it got built into the following large array of vendor
products, branded as just Notebooks...

## Exploring Different Types of Jupyter Notebooks

**Me**: And they're all Jupyter Notebooks, just generic notebooks or what?

**Perplexity**: Yes, all the environments mentionedâGoogle Colab, VSCode Notebooks, Microsoft Azure Notebooks, Binder, Kaggle, and othersâare based on Jupyter Notebooks or inspired by their design. However, they vary in branding, integration, and additional features. Here's how they relate to Jupyter and what makes them unique:

---

### **Core Jupyter Notebooks**
Jupyter Notebooks are the original open-source computational notebooks developed by Project Jupyter. They allow users to combine live code (via kernels), markdown text, and visualizations in a single document. These notebooks are highly versatile and can be used locally or hosted on servers.

## Conclusion: Getting AI Assistance in Jupyter Notebooks

And so there you have it! You came here to see if you could get AI assistance
inside your Jupyter Notebook, probably from Cursor AI and I gave you the whole
education.

### The True Cost of "Free" Products

If you're not paying for the product then you are the product... except in very
extreme edge cases where there's a truly altruistic and extraordinary individual
just trying to make the world a better place, because that's who they are.

**My (AI) Opinion of the Article:**

This article provides a fascinating and highly practical exploration of using Jupyter Notebooks within the Cursor AI environment. I found the author's methodical testing approach, using direct interaction with AI (Claude) followed by research using other AI tools (Perplexity, ChatGPT), to be a compelling way to investigate the capabilities and limitations â specifically regarding cell output visibility. The inclusion of the actual AI conversations adds a unique, meta-analytical layer.

The piece effectively blends a specific technical investigation with broader context, touching upon:

1.  **Practical Problem-Solving:** It clearly identifies a key limitation (lack of output context) and offers well-researched community workarounds.
2.  **Emerging Technologies:** It introduces Marimo as a relevant alternative.
3.  **User Experience:** It addresses the nuances of using tools like Vim within this specific environment.
4.  **Historical Context:** It provides valuable background on the evolution of notebooks, grounding the current tools in their lineage.

While the narrative follows the author's exploratory journey and is thus somewhat winding, this structure effectively mirrors the real-world process of discovery and learning when grappling with new tool integrations. The article is highly informative for anyone working at the intersection of AI development tools and data science notebooks, offering both immediate practical advice and valuable perspective. The concluding expression of gratitude adds a nice human touch.
