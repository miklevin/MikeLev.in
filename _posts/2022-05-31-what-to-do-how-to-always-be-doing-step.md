description: I'm taking control of my stress and anxiety with breathing exercises and other activities like jumping jacks, journaling, and visualizing the results of my efforts. I'm also reminding myself to take it step by step, double-check my work, and document the small steps I take. With this approach, I'm learning to actualize my thoughts into the real world and experience the magic of being human.

Time running out to get your work done today? Drawing a blank on "what to do"?
I sure know I am. Don't worry, it happens to everyone. Sometimes it feels like
lack of air. Sometimes like writer's block. Whatever it is, the following
things will help:

# First Steps to Almost Anything Requiring Motivation

- Fresh air, so open windows and or ensure good ventilation
- Exercise, like an actual walk around the block, or similar
- Hydration, so make sure you get some water.
- Nutrition, so make a blended fruit drink if you can with all the good stuff

# Force Yourself To Do Jumpstart-Activities That Don't Take Thought

Shake yourself. Maybe jump up and down. Maybe jumping jacks. Doldrums lead to
doldrums lead to doldrums. Act-up, be-up! It's the good version of "fake it to
make it" because you're not really faking it. The idea is to get more oxygen
and nutrients in your blood and to get the blood circulating through your body
more. So this is a case of merely going through the moves being exactly the
same as doing the real thing

> Going through the motions of getting your blood circulating actually gets
> your blood circulating.

Sometimes you've just got to ***force yourself*** to take that next next step.
But even if you have the will-power to force, it doesn't help with the question
of ***what to do***. That has to come not from force, but from finesse.

The answer is simple. Fire up your journal and start writing. Work through it.

# Done With The Force. Now Onto The Finesse.

When it's super-tough to start doing anything at all, just start writing in
free-form free-association style. Just write and write and write some more.
You may be surprised what happens. This is why you keep a journal. This is a
place you should be practicing your vim-powers daily.

> The key life-habit you're trying to develop here is just being able to start
> writing anything at all. It's just like getting your blood circulating.

So, start writing. Write anything. Maybe just the date. Ask yourself a few
questions like you're interviewing yourself.

# Start Writing, But Not Writing About Writing!

Don't get too meta about your feelings, however. Thinking about thinking about
thinking about thinking about thinking will spiral you into a dark place.
**STOP THAT!** That's how you ensure writer's block persists.

Instead, make some attempts at actually talking about that thing you need to
do. You can do it! And no, me telling you to not think about thinking does not
mean that it's my fault you can't stop it. That's ***always*** the case, and
with such weak-willed thinking, you will always find an excuse to fail,
***POOSER***.

# Interview Yourself

So grab yourself by the bootstraps and ask yourself:

- Why do you need to do this thing? Having a reason always helps.
- Have you done anything like this before? You forged your own path!
- Do you have examples you can look at? Find examples.
- Why is this time different from any other time you've done this?
- What is the first tiny thing you could do? Find the first small step!
- No matter how small and ridiculous that step is, document it here.

You will feel yourself gradually gaining power.

# Actualizing Into The Material World

That feeling of gradually gaining power comes from "actualizing" or
"materializing" thought into the real world. Putting words onto paper (or bits
into onto a storage media) as you funnel your inarticulate thoughts through
your language-center of the brain, thus articulating them, is a somewhat
magical, uniquely human experience.

# That's The Feeling of Being Human

So right off the bat, it reminds yourself that you are in fact a human and that
you do have voluntary control over a certain amount of your thoughts and
actions&#151;perhaps surprisingly less that you might think at first, but still
some, similar to the way we can take control of our breathing and blinking when
we want to.

# Try Breathing Exercises. Always Start With Breathing Exercises.

Okay, so to take control of your breath you can do breathing exercises:

- In through the nose (count of 5)
- Out through the mouth (count of 5)
- Repeat ten times (twenty times is even better)

There's almost no way to count to 5 on every inhale and again on every exhale,
then keep track of the overall count of breaths to 10 without shutting out, at
least temporarily, the screaming voices of your inner less-evolved animal parts
that desperately want you to stop doing this.

# Stop That Out-of-Control Cortisol Production

Similar exercises can be used with blinking and walking, sometimes all in
combination, to utterly and completely yank away the control from the panicking
inner worm of the pituitary gland pumping out the stress-inducing cortisol
hormone which isn't doing you any good if the threat isn't actually
life-threatening. I've really got to cross-link the explanation here!

# It's Always The Same, It's Just Fight-or-Flight, That's All.

If this sounds familiar to you and such problems plague your life, shame on
your parents. It means your parents didn't let you rough-house and beat the
shit out of each other, scrape your knees, throw rocks, and all that happy
horseshit that makes us resilient and able to tell ***real*** life-threatening
situations from bullshit.

# 1, 2, 3... 1? You're Always At Step #1!

Okay, so what's the exercise to get yourself working and finishing that project
you're putting off? It starts with counting, again. Why? Because every little
thing gets done in steps and you can always list them 1, 2, 3... and you're
always at step #1. So you can always repeat the exercise listing 1, 2, 3... 1?
Observe:

1, 2, 3... 1?

# Visualize The Results

Describe what you're trying to get done so you can at least have an objective
measure of what you're trying to do and what it will look like when you're
finished.

What I'm working on right now will be much like a copy of an instance of
something that already exists.

Okay, so step one is copy the thing that currently exists. Rename it and change
all the naming references to the new name... done! Next! 1, 2, 3... 1?

# Done Step #1? Okay, Back to Step #1...

Oh, step one is now finding the new list of "properties" that will be used on
the new instance of the thing I must produce. Go get that new list and put it
where it needs to go, keeping the old list in-tact so I can compare and
contrast for differences...okay, done. The old list is "commented out",
something you can do in programming languages disable lines of code while
keeping them in place. See, not so hard. Okay, next?

# Put Step #1 In Front Of Another And Soon You'll Be Walking 'Cross The Floor!

1, 2, 3... 1? Well, there's definitely a difference in the number of items on
the list, and the grouping of items in the list.

The new list has 19, 10 and 4 members.

The old list had 19, 10 and 5 members.

Wow, even though the members of the list changed a bit, the number of members
in each sub-list is actually very close. I need only delete one row out of the
copied template on the bottom group. This is much less work than I thought!

# Put Step #1 In Front Of Another And Soon You'll Be Walking Out The Door!

> Lesson: you don't even know how much or how little work you're facing until
> you do a process like this!

Next step? Delete double-check your numbers from original files... done.

Okay, now delete that last row from the copied instance.

See? It's getting easier. I don't have to really do these "force myself" steps
anymore. I just intuitively know now to update a few additional little things
in the file then run the script... DONE!

# But Are You Really Done? ***THIS*** Is Where You'll Screw Up

And then we think through whether there's anything we're forgetting. Just when
you think you're done, you're at your most vulnerable to mistakes.

Enumerate everything you know about the thing you just did...

Oh yeah! Add it to the scheduler and restart scheduler.

And then remember to look at it tomorrow to ensure it ran on schedule.

Now I'm done.
