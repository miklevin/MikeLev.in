title: Figure Out Why vim Journaling is an Asset
headline: Discover the Benefits of Vim Journaling and FOSS Tools to Stay Independent
description: I'm passionate about free and open source software and determined to stay independent from big companies. Join me in my live interactive chat session to journal about tech and explore the possibilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT. I'm also advocating for the use of Linux and other FOSS tools to help developers stay free and independent. Come join me and learn more!

I don't do slick videos. I like to journal. So in the same way that people will
watch others gaming online, doing play-through and such, I'm going to just make
an big ol' live interactive chat session of a journaling session with you here
each day while I'm finished with one job and before another job has begun. I've
got a lot of energy to put into things. Now I've made it eminently clear that
intended to get out in front of people regarding SEO, and my passion free and
open source SEO software, in particular. Irons are hot with AIs busting onto
the scene now in the first meaningful in our lives way that history will
forever now record as ChatGPT from OpenAI and not Google.

Why? Because fear. Because as Moon-shotty as it may talk, Google is at heart a
deeply conservative company because AdWords pay-per-click revenue. It's not the
way the world necessarily works. It's the way the world works because of a
fluke and an anomaly of history that it was Google and not AltaVista or
GoTo.com, each of which brought a fundamental building block of Google's
success to the market before Google. What's often unspoken is that bravery
matters. Big, brave moves that puts your reputation, at least momentarily on
the line, is required for big steps forward. Remember Microsoft's rapidly
corrupted Tay ChatBot? Microsoft's no stranger to having some mud in their
face. Their diversified income sources make them more brave than Google.

Google is not so shy in publishing their breakthroughs like transformers or
their code like Chromium which competitors are free to pick up and use against
them, and which Microsoft does with such seasoned expertise. Wow, how fast that
blue light saber turns red in the grasp of new blue. Blue because Azure. Who
even remembers that Big Blue used to mean IBM?

Microsoft doesn't only use Google's generously provided FOSS tools against
them. Microsoft is also happy to use the entire free and open source software's
central jewel, Linux, against itself. Get people familiarized enough with Linux
but only in just enough ways so that you maintain a Microsoft dependency. It is
paramount for example that nobody get acquainted with ssh, git or vim. No
worries, we'll eliminate the need to actually know ssh or git through veatures
in our VSCode text editor, which is built on the Google Electron platform, LOL!

It's almost humorous the number of places Microsoft dependency pitfalls are
coded into the modern tech learning experience. All roads lead to Microsoft,
except for the Apple ones. But the Apple roads are little better, enormously
proprietary as they are. A developer, or even just a literate coder, is best
served being on a nice, modern Linux with a nice modern software repository.
You don't need no Microsoft dependencies. Oh, except for Github... for now.
Let's get on with a modern developer's life who's hell-bent on not letting
Microsoft, or any vendor really, own my soul.

My tools be mostly my tools, or at least, everybody's through its liberal FOSS
licensing. That's one of the things so magical about Linux. That philosophy is
infused into everything from the operations system up.

Okay, that's a good place to talk. Just talk about tech. The history of tech
with ChatGPT & Mike. ChatGPT is my Hecklefish! Hahahaha!
