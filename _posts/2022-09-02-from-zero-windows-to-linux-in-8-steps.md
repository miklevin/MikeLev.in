Okay, plan out this video series.

Dive right in with removing OneDrive. Done. These blip-videos are in the
perfect aspect ratio for YouTube. I save directly from OBS to mp4, which means
I can upload directly to YouTube without any editing.

In my journaling / blogging / vlogging / jekyll / github pages system, I have
now added the category "windows" which will represent this series. This first
page in the series will both be my planning and the optimized page on this
first very important step in the series: removing OneDrive.

Next?

Go down Settings / Personalization
- Lock Screen: Turn off Get fun facts
- Themes: Desktop icon settings / Uncheck Recycle Bin
- Start: Off, all the way down
- Taskbar
  - Turn on Use small taskbar buttons
  - Turn off Show badges on taskbar buttons
- Notification area
  - Turn off everything you can (keep WiFi, Battery)

It's time to plunge into the Settings program, adjusting the Taskbar
personalization, among other things. Marketing-oriented stuff is cleverly
hidden under such settings as Startup. Make sure to nix those intrusive effers.

Okay, putting it all together:

1. Uninstall OneDrive
2. Unpin everything from Taskbar
3. Delete all Tiles from Start menu
4. Change Settings / Personalization
5. Turn of Weather, Cortana, Search & other Taskbar clutter
6. Bring back app icons you want to Start Menu & give shortcuts
7. Use Virtual Desktops
8. Install Linux

Okay, I made this series of videos. Embed them all here with their headlines,
and use that as the starting point for your new sequence-generator under your
content management system. This is key to organization, thus story-telling and
thus breaking out and blowing up on YouTube and other outlets.
