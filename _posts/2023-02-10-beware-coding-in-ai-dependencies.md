title: Beware Coding In AI-Dependencies
headline: "Don't Depend on Big Companies: Create Your Own AI Datacenter on Your Bookshelf!"
description: I am warning of the dangers of coding AI-dependencies, which only serves to increase the gap between the rich and the poor. Instead of relying on big companies for competitive advantage, I am encouraging people to make it happen on their own. With the decrease in cost of AI model-training hardware, I am suggesting that people can have a datacenter on their bookshelf. To learn more, I am advising people to chat with ChatGPT about the Socratic Method.

I could not have positioned my schtick better for the rise of AI: How to resist
obsolescence. While yeah sure, it seems profoundly enabling of the little-guy,
let me tell you that the main effect of AI is going to be to make the rich
richer and the poor poorer. While you might have access to some of the
rudimentary benefits of AI, like an ever-present tutor (which is AWESOME), it's
nothing compared to the world-shaping stuff in the datacenters of Google and
its like.

Don't hold your breath for AI-at-home that will benefit you with any real
competitive advantage over the masses, and particularly not over big companies.
If you want that, you're going to have to make it happen on your own which is
precisely what I'm going to do. Moore's Law will continue pushing down cost of
AI model-training capable GPU laden hardware until you have a datacenter in a
shoebox the total power equivalent of what you need the cloud for today. Bank
on it.

The goal of big companies is to keep you from realizing it and to delay that
reality until it's too late. If enough "cloud dependencies" are coded into AI
at is birth, then you'll always have to drink at the teats of big companies to
pretend to have competitive advantage over them and others. Don't take up
residence on a castle in the cloud when you can have that same castle on your
bookshelf.

Chat with ChatGPT today about the Socratic Method. Ask it if it can be caught
in contradictions through it. Ask what the most used operating system in the
world is. Ask if it knows what Intel IME is. Etc.

Continue working on the MikeLev.in website. It's my CSS playground. Forget
JavaScript. Push the boundaries with HTML, CSS and even SVG.
