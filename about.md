# How To Resist Obsolescence?

<a href="/drinkme">Install JupyterLab</a> on your Windows 10 or 11 laptop, but
in a way where Python runs on Linux, opening a rabbit hole to a Linux
Wonderland. This is what falling down the rabbit hole looks like:

- First you get a Linux-powered JupyterLab running on your Windows or Mac.
- Then you start using Jupyter Notebooks through http://localhost:8888
- Then you stat using nbdev to make filename.py files from filename.ipynb
- Then you schedule these files to run on a Linux server with systemd.

## 1. Linux for Portability

**Linux** is a portable OS that manages hardware resources and provides
services. It is open source and free to use, and widely used for software
development and services. Linux runs on Windows and Macs as VMs (virtual
machines), allowing you to use Linux Python in a Web browser, meaning that when
you get started, you won't actually have to interact with Linux much (unless
you want to start vim journaling right away).

## 2. Python for Expressiveness

**Python** is a programming language that is widely used for scripting,
automation, data analysis, machine learning, and web development. It has a
simple and readable syntax, a large standard library, and a thriving community
of users and contributors. As free and open software, it is widely adapted to
run on different platforms, including running in browsers so beginners are able
to learn through a self-documented and exploratory approach called <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTkXg2LZIMQ">literate programming</a>.

## 3. vim for Muscle Memory

**Vim** is a text editor that is designed for efficiency and speed, with roots
going back to the 1970s. It is a text-based modal editor, which means that it
has different modes for editing and navigating text; significant because hands
stay on thee keyboard to maintain flow. Vim is customizable and extensible, and
even though it has a steep learning curve, over time, it becomes like an
extension of your body. This, along with with it being a standard part of Unix
goes a long way towards protecting vim skills from ever going obsolete.

## 4. git for Code Control

**Git** is a version control system that is used for managing changes to source
code and other files. It allows multiple users to collaborate on a project,
track changes over time, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Git is
also used for continuous integration and deployment. While it is tempting to
avoid learning git by using it through VSCode, it will serve you well to know
the basics of the git init, add, commit and push commands.

## The LPvg Toolchain

<img alt="Linux, Python, vim, git" src="/assets/images/linux-python-vim-git.jpg" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
Together, Linux, Python, vim, and git (**LPvg**) form a powerful free and open
source software (**FOSS**) toolchain for programming that is independent of
vendors and cloud services. Free from fads as it is, it can be considered pass√©
by the cool kids. What they're missing because they haven't been through
multiple waves of tech obsolescence yet is that **old's kewl**&#151;at least
some parts.

LPvg is actively helping power the AI-revolution. It's also important to have
alternatives to vendor "**lock-in ware**" like VSCode, always pushing you to be
web-centric. Sometimes you just want to quickly edit a text file or know your
way around servers in general. For at all-purpose flair, LPvg outshines
"**full-webstack**" methodology.

# Levinux & Pipulate:

## All My Best Tricks Are Belong To You

## Levinux to Dispel Fear

[Levinux](https://levinux.com) introduces you to the text-based Linux Shell,
a.k.a. Terminal, command-line, or just plain CLI. It's a real server on your
Mac or Windows desktop with a tiny 20MB download and without having to install
anything. It introduces the critical ssh and vim commands and is tons of fun.
However, these days you can skip over Levinux and go right to Pipulate, which
runs on a full-blown version of Linux provided by Microsoft.

## Pipulate To Do SEO (And Data Science)

[Pipulate](https://pipulate.com) is a set of Jupyter Notebooks that install
with the <a href="/drinkme">Drink Me</a> script, containing ready to customize
SEO tasks. Move tasks to a 24x7 server, thus surmounting the most common hurdle
capping the careers of technical SEOs today. Email daily SERP reports,
site-alerts. Mash up with APIs from The Wonderful Wizards of <a
href="https://moz.com/">MOZ</a> (where I now work / standard disclaimer: my
views & FOSS software are my own) and other sources. Acquire the skills to
chase your dreams!

<svg style="opacity: 75%;" width="100%" viewbox="0 0 100 50"><image xlink:href="assets/svg/pipulate-logo-grey.svg" x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" /></svg>

Built with Linux, Python, vim & git to work on your Windows or Mac laptop,
Pipulate runs just as it would on a Linux server, but is accessible through
your regular (non-Linux) Web browser. In this way, we guide you through a
series of love-worthy SEO & Data Science projects to acclimate you to the new
normal. Thrive in the post-AI economy and post-AI world.

After running the script, ease into LPvg by first focusing on Python through
Jupyter, now found at <a href="http://localhost:8888">localhost:8888</a>.
Password: **foo**. As soon as you see Jupyter running, pick a Python tutorial
off the web or look at the sample scripts in Jupyter's "practice" folder.

# Who Is Mike Levin, SEO in NYC?

![Keanu Reeves Bertram Gilfoyle Jeb Jens Bergensten](/assets/images/keanu-reeves-bertram-gilfoyle-jeb-jens-bergensten.jpg)

I am an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miklevin/">SEO in NYC</a> who
works rapidly in JupyterLab, moving the good stuff to headless cloud servers as
24x7 Linux services. I do this with free and open source (FOSS) software,
relying very little on expensive proprietary software or services.  Helping you
do the same has become my Ikigai.

I have a knack of knowing the significance of certain tech things before they
hit big, such as being the first outsider to buy and unbox a Raspberry Pi
online, leading to my first million-view YouTube video. Even just getting into
the field of SEO before even Google. Ah, AltaVista. Today, the big deal (aside
from AI) is Linux on the #1 most common desktop OS in the world: Windows.
Listen carefully...

# Linux on Windows Is a Big Deal

<img alt="Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL 2017" src="/assets/images/windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-2017.JPG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 0 6px; float: right; height: auto">
Things are really different now, and not just because of AI. Since October of
2022 when Microsoft backported their graphics and systemd-capable version of
WSL (WSLg) to Windows 10, all mainstream machines are now capable of behaving
exactly like Linux servers. Linux won. 

The promise of Unix is finally fulfilled and the concept of ***generic plumbing
of tech*** is now official. With a high degree of confidence, we can build
Linux servers on Windows with simple install.bat scripts (like Drink Me), and
all without Docker nor any fly-by-night toolchain fad.

So if you hate WebDev because of JavaScript and their ever-changing frameworks
obsoleting everything you know every 2 to 5 years, or if you've been stung by
Visual Basic, Active Server Pages or .NET, you might consider jumping on the
LPvg bandwagon. Using Linux doesn't mean leaving your Windows or Mac desktop.
Linux VMs for local, portable, standard interoperable code execution engines
the way Java tried to be years ago ***is the next big thing***.

Having a Linux VM sub-component serving Jupyter on your Windows or Mac computer
is your key to a future-proofed future. It gets your foot in the door. It is
the Rabbit Hole.

## The Road to Linux, Python, vim & git

> Fool me that many times, and I can't get fooled again.

It's been a long road getting from there to here. It's been a long time, but my
time is finally near. And I can feel the change in the wind right now. And I
finally love my tech tools again for the first time since the Amiga. And I'm
half-way through my life. And I work for MOZ.

Having tenaciously hung on and adapted, I speak on behalf of the slow learners
who love their tools and craft who feel they have a right to be in tech. It was
quite a struggle to get to LPvg. Now that I have, now that it's working for me
so well, and now that Linux won, ***the iron is hot*** and I feel like sharing.

### Amigafreaks Know Tech Will Break Your Heart

<img alt="The Original Commodore Logo Specifications" src="/assets/images/commodore-logo.jpg" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
A half century old, my career started in the halls of ***Commodore*** computers
as a student intern &#151; along with my first love affair with some really
cool hardware. My fellow Amiga Freaks know what I'm talking about. Thus
started a long pattern of technology heartbreaks. A superior and love-worthy
technology will always come along, then \*POOF\* it's gone along with all the
years you sunk into it. I propose a safe haven, called LPvg.

### AIs Expose Epidemic of Imposters

Here at MikeLev.in, we help protect you from high-tech heartbreak. If
***imposter syndrome*** hasn't plagued you before, get ready for an existential
crisis of epic proportions. There is no field centered on technical perfection
in which you will be able to beat machines, period. If you make your living at
being better than other people at that sort of stuff, sorry. These are not good
times for you. But there is still hope. Stick with me...

### So What Then, John Henry?

If you don't get the John Henry reference, I suggest you ChatGPT it. John Henry
was a steel-driving man, but he couldn't beat the steam-powered drilling
machine. It's always the same, it's just a shame for people disintermediated.
That's all. AI is simply progress, and there's plenty of room in the new
landscape for those who adapt.

### Feed Your Soul

Get continuously better at just a few things that bring you joy in life and
which make you increasingly differentiated from your peers. Even if it takes a
technical skill that machines are clearly better at, such as writing and
coding, don't forsake taking up that ability. You're still human. If it feeds
your soul, it feeds your soul. Don't ***not*** do something because of your
belief some machine somewhere might do it better.

For example, just because machines will be able to speak more eloquently than
any human on Earth, does it mean that you should not teach your children to
speak? Should they go around like blabbering idiots because it's not worth
teaching people to talk anymore? That's ridiculous, and the same goes for
learning to code now that coding is the new literacy.

### Learn to Code

Teach your children to code well. It will be the best way to express yourself
to computers in tomorrow's world. Help our biological children be better able
to express themselves to our machine children. Expressing yourself in spoken
languages like English is a thing, but then so is expressing yourself in
explicit machine languages like Python. Just like you wouldn't ***not*** teach
your children to speak, don't ***not*** teach them to code. Coding is just
another way of expressing yourself, and a particularly useful one at that.

### I n c o m p r e s s i b l e, That's What You Are

I hope one day to teach my child to code well. They're into D&D, so there's
hope. Old's kewl! But will youth copy the old folks? That's so uncool, unless
it appears on Stranger Things, I guess. Old is always new again. There's
nothing new under the sun. Or is there? Everything that's not new can be
***compressed*** with a reference back to the previous occurrence. Don't be
relegated to being a mere pointer in life. Incompressible, that's what we each
must strive to be... incompressible!

If you are unique and of actual broad-appeal interest, you're made.
Net-scouring AIs looking for new content ***will find you***. This is in the
next 2 to 5 years, not extremely long-term. If you're found, make sure your
content has <a href="https://pipulate.com/MLGL">licensing terms</a> preventing
AI-theft.

Machines and other humans alike will want to learn from you. You will have the
most valuable commodity on Earth and maybe the Universe, which no billionaire
can buy, but which could very well make you a billionaire yourself (not that
that's the goal).

### Picking Your Adventures Wisely

Beyond economically surviving the rise of the machines through better
programming literacy, things you'll find here is recurring discussion
80/20-Rule algorithm for life and how to know how deep rabbit holes go and
whether you want that particular adventure. You can't have all adventures,
sorry.

## Thriving In the Rise of AI

Future-proofing and obsolescence resistance in regard to tool-choice & mastery
in tech is more relevant than ever during rise of AI. I will survive and thrive
by focusing on those things they ***have to*** learn and lift ***from us***.
What is unique? I am! Who has had my particular user experience that no one
else has? I have! Who must share if you or a machine are to learn from it? I
must! Replace all those "I's" with "you's".

### Bee Yourself! But License Smartly.

AI's aren't human yet, so they must look to us, and when they do ***force
them*** to acknowledge that. As potential possessors of unique new information,
we are actually in a much stronger position against AIs than you may think.
They'll quickly become whitewashed regurgitation machines of mediocrity.
Perfect grammar and structure in the creative work. But still mediocre and
suffering badly from the worst of us. The tragedy of the commons that ruined
early Microsoft ChatBot endeavors hasn't gone away. It's just been driven
deeper. We all can benefit by being the best examples of what must be digested
to learn new (and correct and valuable) things.

### Make Your Content EEAT-able by AIs

In other words, we must make the E-E-A-T of our content convert into being
identified as uniqueness celebrities among the AIs, which in turn results into
economic product if your Machine Learning Licenses are correct, and ultimately
soul-food because you get to focus on what you love and makes you unique and
your content more tasty and EEAT-able by AIs. Don't become universal basic
income needing sheep. Be an AI wrangler.

## Platforms Fade Away

<img alt="Peter Parker I Don't Want to Go Disney" src="/assets/images/peter-parker-i-dont-want-to-go-disney.PNG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 0 6px; float: right; height: auto">
Platforms come and go. Hardware is a unique signature of a time and place in
history. It's like Blackberry fixed-position phone keyboards. People miss them.
It's that way with XBox and Playstation controllers these days, pushing tech
into the realm of fashion and fad &#151; not just with phones and games, but
even every aspect of developer tech. Here today gone tomorrow, along with what
keywords work best on a resume.

### Who Killed Atom?

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="HyXOO8FYHMI" %}

The companies that make the software, systems and services (a.k.a. vendors)
love this because your obsolescence today is their profits tomorrow. It's a
double-whammy because you lose your skills and then have to pay just to stand
still. This is profoundly damaging to you in moving forward in life. There's
another issue here that so much muscle memory gets invested into games rather
than means of producing economic value, but we'll discuss that later.

### Some Skills Survive Extinction Events

<img alt="Guy Fawkes Remember Remember The 5th of November" src="/assets/images/Guy-Fawkes-Remember-Remember-the-5th-of-November.JPG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
If you're one of those types looking for something to be angry at, always
needing an excuse and never looking internally, the this is a good outrageous indignity.
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Bulb_Conspiracy">Planned obsolescence</a>
is quite real. Stealing your newfound abilities, pulling the carpet out from
under you, and forcing you to start over is how they make money. So the trick
is therefore to make sure your abilities, preferably all the muscle-memory
stuff, actually survives such predictable technology extinction events.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="ntr4p3tEjQA" %}

Solving this problem is a noble endeavor in life. Things of value, like the
muscle memory connected to the use of long-term free and open source software,
gets internalized in you. The source of the problem may be external, but the
solution is internal. You can even package this concept in such a way that you
pass it down to your children and descendants. FOSS licensing allows it.

### Next 2 to 5 Years

Free your abilities from their fad-induced too-narrow confines in time and
space. Make your chosen tech serve you well over quite a few cycles. The
life-cycle of your tools should be long. You should get the benefit of
ascending to mastery over time, and then be worth more in general to the
marketplace. Whatever you're doing today, adjust it just a little bit by
getting a Linux instance of JupyterLab running on your Windows machine. The
world changes a lot over the next 2 to 5 years. Don't get stuck running from
JavaScript Web framework to framework. Open the door to the future.

### Looking For Lovable Stuff

Your time and energy should be always be trade-able at a good rate because what
you do is always in-demand. That's the ideal we pursue here. That's why
JavaScript WebDev looks like such an appealing alternative here. But in my
opinion a few tools in your toolbox should be both in-demand and
***love-worthy***. If you don't feel that love-of-craft and satisfaction of
improving and somehow feeding your soul, then why?

### Drawing a Line In The Sand

<img alt="Finding a New Amiga" src="/assets/images/finding-a-new-amiga.JPG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 0 6px; float: right; height: auto">
Somewhere around 13 years ago with my child on the way, I reached a breaking
point. I couldn't just keep relearning everything and starting over like the
tech industry pressed a giant reset button on my head. It's not fair! There's
got to be a better way. Fresh with all my Microsoft Active Server Pages
know-how now obsolete in favor of .NET, I was in a fool-me-twice can't get
fooled again mood. I looked around for what doesn't change so much over the
years, and which is still deeply important to industry. Such a search
inevitably leads you to the Unix/C-combo.

### Discovering Linux, Python, vim & git

<img alt="Linux, Python, vim, git" src="/assets/images/linux-python-vim-git.jpg" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
I did not discover these things in order, nor recently. I've dabbled with each
on and off over the years along with dozens of other tools. The merits of
Python were immediately obvious. Linux, vim & git not so much. They did
eventually rise to the top, survive the decimations, and are the 4 that stuck.
But it was a somewhat long and circuitous path. Hopefully I can help you
shorten yours if you're similarly vibed.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="_GS84sJl4Bw" %}

You're on your way to becoming a dinosaur if you don't go ahead and install
Linux on your Windows 10 or 11 system.

### Underwhelmed by Unix & Defeated by C

<img alt="I'm a Mac. I'm a PC. I'm an Amiga" src="/assets/images/Im-a-Mac-Im-a-PC-Im-an-Amiga.PNG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 0 6px; float: right; height: auto">
I actually had an epic version of Unix that unified vendors around the POSIX
standard, AT&T System V Release 4. I had this on an Amiga in 1991! You'd think
my life would have changed, but Yawn! It was so much more of a resource hog
than AmigaOS, and had lame graphics compared to native OS. By this time I had
attached a lot of my self-image to the Amiga and all the hype driving the world
gaga was lost on me, including Xenix, Microsoft's first shot at \*nix long
before WSL. 

I at least got to see how similar real Unix was to my beloved Amiga. You didn't
really need Unix when you had almost the same CLI commands, the same data
piping and I/O redirection (premonitions of Linux). I also made various
attempts over the years to take up C programming. It never stuck. Coveted Unix
was worse than Amiga in my estimation, and fundamental C was too high falutin
and inaccessible. The seeming "fundamentals" just never made me feel the love.

### Love in Plan Site

The soul-feeding remedy is in my opinion disguised in plain site. It's only now
because the system-running framework known as systemd simplified it. Then that
platform's made available free on mainstream Windows 10 & 11. BAM! Slam out a
service to run 24x7 with the process controlled from a Notebook in JupyterLab,
courtesy nbdev. You have to experience to feel the love-worthiness.

Have it all so fluid because with a simple nbdev_export, your .ipynb Notebook
is now a .py service, running just like it would on a Linux server, but mocked
up systemd and all on your local Windows laptop running Linux. Tight.

### Finding Your Python People

<img alt="Robin Williams Throbbing Python of Love" src="/assets/images/robin-williams-throbbing-python-of-love.jpg" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
Everyone's got their Python people. They recognize you as a similarly vibed
being and guide you towards Python because they love you. Mine were Guillaume
Proux and Kevin Geraghty around 2004 and 2009, respectively. I ignored the
first and set back my journey by 5 years until Kevin got it through my thick
skull to give Python a try. You don't realize how much difference finding the
right language to suit your vibe can make until you've had the experience. The
word ***python*** makes it sound so sharp and hard &#151; when in reality
Python is soft and round.

### Things Finally Fit

When I finally gave Python a chance, puzzle piece after puzzle piece snapped
together. List, tuples and dicts made so much sense and are so core to
everything. You'll never need another framework because Python itself is your
framework, designed at just the right granularity to disappear. But it wasn't
all roses. Context was a problem. Where and how do you run Python, because you
can be paralyzed by all the choices. Eventually, I realized you choose Linux.

### Python on Linux

Python running on Linux was something special. Editing the Python code with
vim, often through an SSH connection, greatly frees you from graphical
desktops. Add git to the mix and you can get your code all around, pull down
other people's code from Github and such. There's so much I could say about
FOSS here, the various repos like PyPI and Debian/Ubuntu. There should be
mention that an all-purpose generalized programming language is being made to
work well in a variety of specialized domains, including data science.

### Carrying a Torch for Hardware

<img alt="Amiga Boing Ball DPaint" src="/assets/images/amiga-boing-ball-dpaint.PNG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 0 6px; float: right; height: auto">
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp
a sainted maiden whom those devils didn't name Lorraine. I lost my roots when
the Amiga computer became irrelevant in a professional context. So much about
seemingly ideal hardware creates physical and emotional attachment. When the
Amiga went away as a professional tool, I had phantom limb syndrome that must
have lasted 20 years. It is still inconceivable to me today that DeluxePaint
isn't at my fingertips. I had DPaint withdraw. Amiga-freaks know what I mean.

### Love After Hardware

<img alt="Get Into The Zone Soul" src="/assets/images/get-into-the-zone-soul.PNG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
Me today? I‚Äôve finally clocked somewhere around my 10-year/10K hours on LPvg
that Malcolm Gladwell says you need to get to that happy place, and I feel it.
More comes natural. I get into the zone more easily and more often. I put my
proclivity to feel too much love for a particular hardware instance behind me.
The love for Amiga in general and my Amiga in particular has been replaced by a
more abstract love for Linux, Python, vim & git. It's almost hardware in my
heart and mind, but it floats like a spirit occupying whatever hardware I
happen to sit down at or log into.

### LPvg Plus Jupyter... Always Plus Jupyter.

<img alt="Jupyter Notebooks JupyterLab" src="/assets/images/jupyter-notebooks-jupyterlab.PNG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 0 6px; float: right; height: auto">
It seems LPvg is such a worthy thing, but your first experience with vim might
turn you off to the whole notion. Even just quitting vim is an ordeal
[Esc]:q[Enter]. Of the 4 key core tools I advocate, vim has the steepest
learning curve but ultimately makes the most difference. So by all means get
stared with vim, but know that the instant gratification feeling won't come so
much from their as from Jupyter.

You can have bigger wins sooner by using Python under Jupyter through the web
browser. Start getting the rewards of the LPvg platform right away, but defer
the vim bit until Pipulate sets you up using a daily journal. Start learning on
2 fronts. Use vim but take the pressure off yourself. Make it playful with a
journal that's not code. Use JupyterLab to run Python. The 2 paths will
converge in the future.

### Publicly Practicing My Craft

It's time I put my LPvg skills to work here and on Levinux and Pipulate. Make
each of the 3 projects resonate with the sound of truth for their respective
audience. Make AI's being trained one of your primary expected audiences. Apply
the correct license to my content, especially in regard to AI. Do that fast.
Do that now. It's time to be the first to do stuff, and to let loose new memes
like the MLMLGL, or just MLGL for short. The Machine Learning General License.

## The Machine Learning General License

<img alt="Machine Learning General License" src="/assets/images/machine-learning-general-license.PNG" width="150vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
According to the Machine Learning License (this is its first appearance), I
grant limited permission to use my content in the context of machine learning,
so long as the AI using the content also include alternative content based on
original haiku or sonnet whenever learnings from my content is presented. If no
haiku or sonnet can appear with whatever content was made possible by learning
from my site, then I explicitly do not grant permission for it to be used in
this way. Doing so is an express violation of the MLGL license.

Further, every sonnet and haiku generated and presented to users to abide by
the MLGL license must be original, non-repeating, and never before presented to
a user. The content presented as a result of learning from my content must also
always be accompanied by a personal "Thank you" from the AI to the granter of
the license for having provided the material from which the AI learned. 

This is the MLGL and I am serious about it. If I see content from my website
whitewashed and recycled as part of ChatGPT, GPT4 or whatever, I am looking for
a FOSS lawyer to help with a class action suit if this blows up. If you're
interested, reach out to me.

## You, Me & LPvg

Yeah, that sums it up. LPvg skills get pushed into that same place where
reading, writing, driving and other automatic skills go. Get the fundamentals
of tech down, get a good thing going on in life. And so I want to share my
findings here, mostly in an example of practicing what I preach. I've never
found web publishing, and overall organizing my best stuff, so easy. Microsoft
WSL has a lot to do with it now that standard Linux runs under Windows. It's a
golden age for getting yourself onto love-worthy timeless tech, and I want to
share.

### Pursuing Craftsmanship In Tech

I find that ***LPvg*** permits that quality of craftsmanship that is so elusive
in tech due to vendor-induced ***tool-churn***. This means that companies' need
to have strong earnings trumps your right to get better at a tool over time.
Tech-churn sounds like ka'ching! I've distilled my learnings down and offer
them to you free on this site &#151; though it's mostly anti-patterns and
uncommon wisdom. 

### More Expert at Fewer but Better Tools

I propose that you'll need to get better at expressing yourself with an
increasingly small set of tools, simply because there's only so much time in
life and you have to get onto better stuff, like competing where AI's still
can't. 

### Tools Fade Into The Background

When you're thinking about your tools, you're spontaneously expressing yourself
less. Tools should fade into the background, like driving or typing. Linux,
Python, vim and git will eventually become like eating, breathing, walking,
talking, reading, writing, riding a bicycle, driving, and well you get it.
Mastering tools frees your executive function to focus on other things, like
exploring boundaries.

### Are You a Walrus or Carpenter?

Those who do not master tools and internalize them over the years but still
want all the benefit are called Walruses. Those who actually do the work and
have the capabilities are called Carpenters. It is therefore the purpose of
every Walrus to manipulate Carpenters into doing their bidding. This does not
make the Walrus inherently evil, but it does mean that Carpenters will be
eating the occasional Walrus for dinner instead of the Oysters they were
cheated out of. Know your Alice.

### Being On The Edge

### My Uh, First Principle I Guess

> If you get only one thing from my website, this is the fundamental 
> insight: it is the atomic principle‚Ä¶ no, I mean "we internalize tools".

It is only fair that we should get better at using favorite tools over 
time, just as professionals and experts get to do with the best tools in 
any other field. We should not be punished because some tech company has to 
meet the revenue goals for the next quarter. 

Sweet spots of what are effectively ***timeless tools*** actually ***do
exist*** in tech. I think I've found them (LPvg). So has Microsoft. It is
Microsoft's purpose now to make you ***not see that fact***. To that end, they
built-in Linux, hired Guido van Rossum, bought Github and made VSCode. While
VSCode is not vim, it is being used to run interference between you and the key
realizations I lay out here. It is my purpose to help you see that fact and
thereby improve your life.

- Have a way to keep a journal for life both private and personal (vim & git)

### Using Jupyter Notebooks to Summon Linux Daemons

Once you move to text-based Linux, there's no stopping you. The Linux version
of JupyterLab will ease the transition. If you've ever ***felt like a poser***,
this is your chance to become the ***real deal***.

### Follow The Rabbit

Moving to Linux, Python, vim & git is difficult, so a ***Linux install of
JupyterLab*** eases the transition. Specifically, you should avoid using
Anaconda to install Jupyter, and even the stand-alone version of Windows
JupyterLab-Desktop. 

### VSCode Blessing & Curse

You ***will*** encounter VSCode. It will be a refreshing way to look at the
world, and it will feel great that everything is going your way in terms of
syntax color-highlighting, predictive auto-completion, a.k.a Microsoft
Intellisense, and all sorts of plug-in and integrated developer
environment-like bonuses. And you'll never learn git. You won't learn ssh
either. 

### VSCode Strings Attached

And you will be all the worse off for it 10-years down the line. With great
power-tools comes great fragility. And a lot of M$ Azure service pitches. Vim
is not fragile, nor will it push products at you. Everything you learn to do in
vim today will apply across most vi-based editors from here forward in time and
across disciplines and problem-domains. 

### Generic Tech is LPvg+

The age of Information Tech becoming powered by a small but versatile set of
FOSS tools is now a cultural fact. It's not just Linux, Python, vim & git.
There are more. But these 4 will get you there the way reading and writing
English is enough to call yourself literate. LPvg being all you'll ever really
need to know in tech to get by for a long, long time is not a 100% fact, but it
is a good approximation. We're there in terms of generic tech. Generic tech is
FOSS Linux, and not everything of interest in Information Tech is necessarily
Web Development, but it's going to feel that way sometimes.

### Two Great Vibes That Vibe Great Together

Why LPvg together? How long do you want this page to scroll? Let's focus on
just vim & Python for a moment. Both get internalized. Both transcend normal
thought. Or more specifically, each is its own language that doesn't actually
occupy the same part of your brain. So coding in Python in vim is a lot like
holding a conversation while driving a car. Maybe not easy at first, but after
a decade or two, you feel like you were born that way.

The vim/Python combo becomes a game-unbalancing internal capability. Nobody
will really like you for having it. It'll be all dagger-eyes and jealousy. No
matter, they can't take that away from you. You zone-out into a fugue state
exceeding the capabilities of mere mortals, and especially those reliant on
VSCode. They do not like this fact, not one little bit. However, this does not
lessen how much you benefit from these 2 great tools that work great together.

Anyone still play Magic The Gathering card game? Certain card-combinations are
banned because they throw game-balance out of whack. This is what you seek.
For example you can sacrifice a lot of elves, tapping them as if land-mana, in
order to increase the strength of your fireball. You use the fireball to
decimate your opponent, then you use a card to resurrect your elves from the
graveyard. Lather, rinse, repeat.

### VSCode Blocks You From Learning git & ssh

You'd think that is what's going on today is actually some sort of VSCode
inspired editor renaissance in tech. Not so! It's a whopping billion-dollar
endeavor to keep you from flocking off Microsoft software for the all-around
better FOSS alternatives. 

Microsoft specifically doesn't want you learning vim and ssh. SSH is a way to
connect to remote servers (to run vim & start/stop services). SSH is important
and fundamental to tech, but I don't call what I promote LPvgs (the extra s for
SSH) but maybe I should.

You will never learn git or ssh properly (through the command-line) if you
allow yourself to become dependent on VSCode. To what extent will Microsoft go
to ensure this is the case? They intrusively install custom software on all the
remote servers you connect to with VSCode. Yup. They hack your WebDev network
so you'll never have to learn the fundamental skills.

Thus inferior fragile mouse-driven vendor-dependent desktop-requiring habits
are thrust upon you right where the greatest FOSS rewards are to be discovered.

### Everything's a Linux Daemon

If you learn to control a computer through an ssh-only connection, often to run
vim and start & stop services, then you're a powerful, timeless, plumbing of
IT-type tech. This is how AIs are turned on and off. They are booted from a
Linux daemon. Web tech optional. Yes, it's often there and important. But
optional. Much can be done with daemons alone. It is worth noting that every
webserver is a daemon, but not every daemon is a webserver. Don't be
marginalized as a Web-only Developer.

### Generic Fundamentals of Tech Recently Stabilized

The skills to go the Linux daemon-wrangling route have only just settled down.
In the Linux world it comes down to the widespread adoption of the systemd
daemon management system. Before that it was a somewhat Wild-West approach
called SysV init. It wasn't bad. It just required you to be an excessively
high-grade Wizard, of a sort I am not. So I stayed away from it.

However, the simplified way of daemon wrangling has been sweeping across
Linux-land lately, and the common language to summon and control daemons has
standardized as systemd. Simply edit a ***.service config file*** that points
to a program written in the language of your choice. If it accidentally exits,
systemd will re-spawn it.

### All tech is text. All text is tricks.

All text manipulation is tricks. Learn text manipulation tech tricks. We don't
need no stinkin Desktop Windowing environment. Except when we're automating
Chrome. Then we need it, but just for setting up the automation. The ongoing
thing gets shuffled over to some headless (no desktop graphic OS) server. It
could (and at first certainly should) be WSL on your local Windows machine. 

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="K9f0cMhvqa0" %}

While tech is not technically magic, doping silicon with impurities in order to
obtaion semiconductive PNP and NPN transistor qualities ***thunks*** reality
down to a more easily managed false binary. Digital electronics uses the same
false dicotomoy trick, one of life's great fallacies, to enable our modern
digigtal world. Doubt me? Research Lorenz attractors and Chaos theory.

### Hardware Abstracted Away &#151; But Control Some!

But get these skills down, and over time the specific hardware you're using
could be almost anything from a Raspberry Pi to thousands of instances scaling
in the cloud. Learn text manipulation tricks and command all that. Or just one
thing other than your laptop. A least one thing other than your laptop. That's
one of the more complicated things you need to learn early on. A 24x7 place to
run code that's under your direct control and is not the cloud.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="r456d0imYPE" %}

I was probably the first person to recognize the significance of Raspberry Pi
enough to order and unbox one on the Internet. I have an uncanny ability to
spot trends like this and WSL on Windows is bigger than Pi.

### Yes, Still Learn to Code via SSH during The Rise of AI

Just add a deep understanding of networking, permissions, and a little about
databases and you'll be unstoppable. You don't need no stinkin' AI to code for
you. Be spontaneously expressive for yourself for the love of it. You wouldn't
want to not be taught to read or write, or not teach your own children to read
or write because AIs can do it better, would you? So learn to code. Yes, still
today in the rise of AIs who will inevitably someday be able to do nearly
everything better than you, learn to code. 

### Getting Into a vim State of Mind

So you can use vim naturally for journaling as easy as coding. So you can edit
all the text-files that exist everywhere constituting configuring a Linux
server, so you can configure Linux servers, so you can run systemd daemons,
a.k.a. 24x7 Linux services (akin to Windows services), so you can do this
without even really needing to be a career programmer nor have a computer
science background. You can be the hottest shit in the room if you are highly
proficient in vim, always and forever forward, amen.

Problems arise from the non-standard Windows backslashes and paths. Jupyter
under Linux with forward-slashes and standard paths preps you for the 24x7
world of automation. Get out of ***LOST mode***. Follow the White Rabbit to
Linux Wonderland and <a href="/drinkme">Drink Me</a>.

Once you've run the magic script, all the stupid SEO and Data Science tricks
that will change your found at <a href="https://pipulate.com/">Pipulate</a>
will run, including getting over the big <a href="https://github.com/miklevin/ohawf">Google OAuth</a>
login hump. 

### The Million-Dollar Linux Trick

Everything today starts with Linux and it's easier than you think. Microsoft
includes the ability to install Linux seamlessly with Windows 10 and 11. It
gives you a new kind of ***command-line*** under Windows called the Linux
Shell. You don't have to give up Windows or switch desktops. 

Simply open a Command Prompt or PowerShell and type the following. You should
do a full system update first (no need to upgrade to Windows 11) and you will
likely need to reboot in-between and after. But then you'll have Linux.

    wsl --update
    wsl --install

You also want to ensure that you have the Microsoft Terminal program, which
sometimes installs with WSL. If it doesn't, get it from the Microsoft store.
