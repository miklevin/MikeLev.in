Q: Mike, can you tell us about your background in technology?

A: I'm a technology veteran with decades of experience, currently in my 50s. I've seen the evolution of computing from the days of the Amiga to our current AI-driven era. My passion lies in future-proofing tech skills and helping others navigate the rapidly changing landscape of technology.

Q: What's your philosophy when it comes to staying relevant in tech?

A: I believe in mastering a set of fundamental, versatile tools that I call the "LPvg stack" - Linux, Python, vim, and git. These form the core of what I consider a future-proof skill set. I advocate for avoiding the "hamster wheel" of constantly chasing the latest tech trends and instead focusing on timeless fundamentals that remain relevant across different eras of technology.

Q: Can you elaborate on your approach to technology and development?

A: Certainly. I'm a strong proponent of open-source technologies and reproducible environments. I've developed a comprehensive approach that includes tools like NixOS, Jupyter Notebooks, and FastHTML. I believe in creating portable, reproducible development environments that can be spun up anywhere, anytime. This approach emphasizes independence, adaptability, and sustainability in software development.

Q: How do you view the role of AI in the future of technology?

A: I see AI as a transformative force, but I don't believe it will replace the need for solid coding skills. Instead, I advocate for integrating AI tools like local LLMs (Language Model Models) into our development workflows. I'm particularly interested in how we can use AI to enhance productivity while maintaining control over our development processes.

Q: What are some of the key topics you focus on in your writing and teaching?

A: I cover a range of topics including:

- Mastering the LPvg (Linux, Python, vim, git) stack
- Improving math skills for better tech understanding
- Staying competitive in a changing job market
- Integrating AI tools into development workflows
- Creating reproducible development environments with tools like NixOS
- Web development using Python-centric tools like FastHTML

Q: What's your vision for the future of technology and skill development?

A: I believe in a future where developers have more agency and autonomy. By mastering a set of versatile, fundamental tools, we can adapt to any technological change. My goal is to help people build a skill set that resists obsolescence, allows for creativity and problem-solving, and provides a consistent foundation for tackling any project or challenge in the tech world.
