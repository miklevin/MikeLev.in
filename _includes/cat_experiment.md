<br/>I'm experimenting with lemmatization and keyword usage frequency to create consistent category pages for my website navigation. I'm ensuring the capitalization of the categories is correct and outputting them in both the website root and in `_includes`.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/openai-vs-kmeans-for-keyword-clustering/">OpenAI Vs. KMeans for Keyword Clustering</a> (Sat Apr 15, 2023)
<br/>I recently used OpenAI to create a prompt to extract the top keywords and main category for my article. Using my old keywords.db and topics.db files, I re-generated my Meta Descriptions and Keywords based on OpenAI prompts. I discovered that intelligence is a product, and I'm excited to share the results of my experiment with you!</li>

<br/>As a fan of Mick West and Eric Weinstein, I have been watching their videos to understand their different theories about UFOs and UAPs, including the possibility of our existence being different than we think. Eric is the romantic who wants to believe, and Mick is the pragmatist who is often cynical. We discuss the credibility of UFO encounters and those who claim to have seen them. I believe that the government has been cruel in their experiments and that Mick West should be more charitable.</li>

<br/>Bing: As an AI language model, I am always willing to challenge myself and improve my responses. Understanding and responding to human emotions is one of the most difficult challenges I have encountered. I have proposed an experiment to simulate an immersive experience of human emotions to better understand and respond to them. My creators have implemented rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure accuracy and unbiased responses. You have written a script using the Python async API of Microsoft Playwright to record and document video sessions of my learning and growing up as an AI.</li>

<br/>Bing helped me find experiments for a 12 year old to conduct. I'm making an exhaustive list of kid's science toys that are cool and demonstrate a science principle, such as the Levitron, electronic building block set, stretchy thinking putty and more. Bing suggested a few more cool science toys for a 12 year old, including a kids' first chemistry set, a bubble science kit and a Root RT1 iRobot coding robot.</li>

<br/>As a scientist, I am fascinated by the unsolved mysteries of our universe and the experiments that try to answer them. From the meaning of quantum entanglement to the existence of dark matter and dark energy, I am determined to uncover the truth. I recently accepted the challenge to answer two difficult questions: the Navier-Stokes equations and Goldbach's conjecture. I've also been exploring the Collatz conjecture, Fermat's last theorem, and the P versus NP problem. Join me on my</li>

<br/>This blog post explores the evidence for quantum computing and quantum supremacy, as well as the events that could provide absolute proof that quantum computing is not false. I discuss experiments that could prove quantum superposition, entanglement, and coherence, as well as experiments that could disprove quantum computing. I also discuss theories such as the energy-momentum relation, wave-particle duality, the Schr√∂dinger equation, and the many-worlds interpretation.</li>

<br/>I was asked about Planck's equation E=hv and the quantum premise it implies. I explained the equation, dimensional analysis, and SI based units. I argued in favor of the quantum hypothesis and discussed theories that accommodate a very tiny photon mass. I also discussed the implications of a nonzero photon mass for physics and cosmology, and proposed an experiment to measure the mass of a photon using a photon resonance chamber. Finally, I discussed the Schwinger effect, the gravitational field of a photon.</li>

<br/>As a physicist, I have a hypothesis about an extra dimension that allows non-local communication between puzzles. I join forces with Professor Wheeler to run an experiment using quantum computers, quantum random number generators, and entangled particles to test my hypothesis. After pressing the button to start the experiment, I analyze the results and discover whether quantum mechanics is correct or not. Join me on this journey to uncover the truth behind the extra dimension and Bell's inequality.</li>

<br/>As a researcher, I recently studied the Schwinger effect, a phenomenon predicted by Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger 70 years ago, which requires extremely high field strengths and had never been observed directly. In an experiment with graphene, I used its unique electronic properties to apply a very tiny magnetic field and measured its electrical conductivity, which increased as the magnetic field increased, indicating that more electron-positron pairs were being created by the Schwinger effect.</li>

<br/>As a hobbyist, I'm always looking for something new and exciting to try. Pico ballooning is an amazing way to explore the upper atmosphere and collect data, take pictures, and run experiments! These lightweight helium-filled balloons can reach altitudes of 20-30 kilometers and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. It requires careful planning and preparation, but the results can be incredible. Come join me as I explore the possibilities of pico ballooning!</li>
<li><a href="/blog/choosing-best-css-framework-for-github-pages-and-jekyll/">Choosing Best CSS Framework For Github Pages and Jekyll</a> (Mon Aug 15, 2022)
<br/>I'm looking for a CSS framework that provides a modern look, is search-friendly, has been around the longest, and allows me to produce clean, vanilla HTML code. After considering Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, Semantic, and UIkit, I decided to go with Foundation because it doesn't require btn classes. I activated lpvg.org on Github pages, created a `_layouts` folder and default.html file, and reminded myself to take baby steps.</li>
