<br/>I recently downgraded from Ubuntu 20.04 to Ubuntu 18.04, which broke my blog release system. To fix this, I am switching from Unix Scripts to Python Programs, using argparse and the Python Standard Library to modularize my programs and make them work from the command-line with arguments. I'm learning about the subprocess API options, setting up a virtualenv and installing Python 3.10, creating a git repo, and writing a blog post.</li>

<br/>In this video, I show how to use symbolic links to map a Windows home folder to a Linux home folder, and how to use the 'ln' command and '-s' switch. I also explain setting up a virtualenv as a bonus. I emphasize the importance of backing up .config files in order to avoid losing work in the Linux container. Watch now to learn how to set up your Windows/Linux environment!</li>

<br/>I recently explored the process of downgrading Ubuntu 20.04 to 18.04 under WSL2, as well as concepts such as LXD, venv, virtualenv, tmux, screen, and Python. I discussed the importance of good fixed-file-location habits, and how LXD is similar to venv/virtualenv in terms of packaging dependencies. I also compared Docker and LXD.</li>

<br/>I recently switched from Mac to Microsoft and discovered the power of the vim command :b1. This blog post explores the importance of developing internal resilience and extracting the lessons from life experiences. I discuss the differences between the neocortex and the pituitary gland and how the neocortex can override the signals of the pituitary gland. I also share my experience of trying to get Manim to work on my Windows 11 system, and how I ultimately got it to work on Windows 10. I</li>

<br/>Today was a big day for me - I installed Manim on my Windows machine, used Chocolatey to install vim, and Powershell to create .py files. To top it off, I sent a video that visualizes general relativity. I'm really enjoying exploring the Python Manim math visualization and animation package and all the possibilities it offers. Come join me on my journey and explore the wonders of Python Manim!</li>
