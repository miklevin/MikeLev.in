<br/>I'm focusing on exuding Google's Quality Guidelines, E-E-A-T, by creating unique and genuine content that demonstrates my experience. I'm also keeping dependencies low and updating the Levinux index.html file, as well as making sure the DrinkMe script is accessible. Join me as I take you through my journey to follow Google's Quality Guidelines.</li>

<br/>I am engaging in controlled burns of my personal sites to optimize them for SEO, creating video content, writing to express my thoughts, taking up a "magic spell" to free myself from Windows dependency, and planting the seed of my vibe on a homepage kernel. I am a wizard or mad scientist who wants to lead people through their WSL experience with a twist, warn them of the allures of vendor-ware, and promote HTML5, JavaScript, C, and Unix.</li>

<br/>As a New York SEO expert, I'm making my home cozy and inviting while encouraging people to familiarize themselves with tech and info tech. I'm leveraging my two domains, Pipulate and Levinux, and discussing imposter syndrome and how financial worth isn't a measure of someone's validity. Join me in my journey as I explore the world of tech and info tech and learn how to make your home cozy and inviting.</li>

<br/>I recently installed Linux graphics and Systemd on Windows 10, and now I'm exploring the aftermath. I'm researching how to make the vGPU accessible and usable, mapping locations and environment variables, and setting up the WAYLAND_DISPLAY and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR. I'm looking into lxdwin script, Levinux/Getonux projects, and lxc config set to configure the jupyter environment. Join me as I explore the aftermath of this installation!</li>

<br/>This article describes my attempt to use JupyterLab under LXC and my progress on an automated install script for LXD and Jupyter on WSL. I'm also trying to simulate the tftp tricks I've done in Levinux and make my own bit optional graphics build. Read on to find out more about my journey and how it can help you!</li>

<br/>I'm restructuring my MikeLev.in website, developing Pipulate.com, and upgrading my CMS system. I'm also aware of the need to make Levinux and Pipulate more mainstream, and to get back my PyPI account access. Join me as I work to make these changes and more!</li>
<li><a href="/blog/levinux-a-small-linux-distro-without-gui-for-education/">Levinux, a Small Linux Distro without GUI for Education</a> (Sun May 29, 2022)
<br/>I'm Mike Levinux and I created Levinux, a Linux distro designed to help people learn Unix/Linux. It includes components such as Tiny Core Linux, QEMU, BusyBox, and a virtual Linux, plus a file-transfer system and a server-building script system. I advocate for the use of Vim and Git for security, and suggest using Python and forward-slashes for code that will run anywhere.</li>
