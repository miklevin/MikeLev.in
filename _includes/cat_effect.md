<br/>I'm experimenting with NeoVim, a vim-compatible fork, to live-stream in my journal. I'm also exploring the Meissner and Schwinger effects to create more thrust. To achieve my goals, I'm using Linux, Python, Vim, and Git. I'm creating an updated graphic of my stack to help others succeed. Join me as I dive head-first into my project tomorrow.</li>

<br/>I have created a benchmark test for AI to test their reasoning ability, combining two facts - the Schwinger effect and the Meissner effect - that could lead to a form of propulsion that does not require chemical fuel. I have tested this theory on language models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Bing, and Bard, and have seen the potential of ChatBots, AI's, GAI's, and other technological advancements to help us make predictions.</li>

<br/>I was asked about Planck's equation E=hv and the quantum premise it implies. I explained the equation, dimensional analysis, and SI based units. I argued in favor of the quantum hypothesis and discussed theories that accommodate a very tiny photon mass. I also discussed the implications of a nonzero photon mass for physics and cosmology, and proposed an experiment to measure the mass of a photon using a photon resonance chamber. Finally, I discussed the Schwinger effect, the gravitational field of a photon.</li>
