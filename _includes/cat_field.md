<br/>Clean up your drafts folder and start using `_drafts` for actual drafts! Learn how to set the publish field to false in Jekyll Front Matter, adjust list comprehension to filter out unpublished posts, and preserve fields during the YAML-chopping step. Improve the core yamlchop function with a before and after example and see the result with the first release under the new code.</li>

<br/>This post explores the process of deleting advice fields from a journaling system and replacing them with more interesting questions. It also details how OpenAI's feedback is used to measure success with tools such as web browsers, CURL, and the Python Requests package. The post will be available soon at the provided URL.</li>

<br/>I have created a benchmark test for AI to test their reasoning ability, combining two facts - the Schwinger effect and the Meissner effect - that could lead to a form of propulsion that does not require chemical fuel. I have tested this theory on language models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Bing, and Bard, and have seen the potential of ChatBots, AI's, GAI's, and other technological advancements to help us make predictions.</li>

<br/>As a content producer, I'm exploring how SEO has evolved to include AI, and I'm proposing a new name for this field of marketing. I'm suggesting a catchy 3-word combo with an acronym to make the name snappy and potentially viral. Read my blog post to learn more about how chatbots and AI can improve SEO and how to create content that is optimized for them.</li>

<br/>I was asked about Planck's equation E=hv and the quantum premise it implies. I explained the equation, dimensional analysis, and SI based units. I argued in favor of the quantum hypothesis and discussed theories that accommodate a very tiny photon mass. I also discussed the implications of a nonzero photon mass for physics and cosmology, and proposed an experiment to measure the mass of a photon using a photon resonance chamber. Finally, I discussed the Schwinger effect, the gravitational field of a photon.</li>

<br/>Today is my child's 12th birthday and I'm taking the time to prepare for it. Unloading the car, I'm reflecting on the entanglement of things and how our lives are like quantized units of energy. Are we unique or part of the same rippling quantum field? I'm also reflecting on the Python command I programmed yesterday and its potential future uses. Join me as I explore these thoughts and prepare for a special day.</li>
