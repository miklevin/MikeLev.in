<br/>I'm experimenting with lemmatization and keyword usage frequency to create consistent category pages for my website navigation. I'm ensuring the capitalization of the categories is correct and outputting them in both the website root and in `_includes`.</li>

<br/>I'm using AI, Linux, Python, vim & git to create a journal with entries written by me. I'm optimizing for search engines and testing Copilot to process my thoughts. I'm also writing code to create a description of the OpenAI category and using nltk and collections libraries to find the most common categories. I'm sharing my thoughts and experiences in this journal and making it available to the public.</li>

<br/>As a physicist, I understand how important it is to pay attention to units and dimensions when doing calculations. I explain why it is not valid to drop seconds from Planck's equation and provide an analogy of radians versus degrees to illustrate why radians are better for showing balanced equations. I also discuss how misapplied axioms can create blind spots when it comes to mathematics and the need to be aware of deceptively difficult arguments that may contain hidden flaws.</li>

<br/>As someone who has always struggled with math, I understand that it is a skill that can be improved with practice and dedication. I recently found many online resources and self-teaching tools to help me learn at my own pace, such as the Mathematics Refresher Course on Udemy, a 16-hour Math Refresher course from Alamo Colleges, and 9 free online courses from edX. I'm also exploring the Maxwell Heaviside Schr√∂dinger approach to physics.</li>

<br/>I'm Mike Levin, an SEO living in New York City. I'm exploring the use of ChatGPT to create a real-time journal of a person's life by setting up a schedule and prompts with Python. My goal is to find a way to communicate with someone without being monitored by the corporation. To do this, I suggest using a smartwatch and gradually building trust with the user. Come explore how I'm using ChatGPT to pursue autonomy and freedom.</li>
