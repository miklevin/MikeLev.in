<br/>This post outlines the process of moving OpenAI Completion calls from many functions into to one function. It explains the reasoning behind the decision, the 80/20-rule solution, and the resulting changes. I completed the changes and is now ready to test the results.</li>

<br/>Clean up your drafts folder and start using `_drafts` for actual drafts! Learn how to set the publish field to false in Jekyll Front Matter, adjust list comprehension to filter out unpublished posts, and preserve fields during the YAML-chopping step. Improve the core yamlchop function with a before and after example and see the result with the first release under the new code.</li>

<br/>I have moved the 1-long-page version of my journal.md file to the `_drafts` folder, allowing me to keep posts unpublished without giving them a yaml title. This is a great way to keep posts out of Github publishing space, while still allowing them to be sliced & diced.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/dropping-openai-advice-field-adding-question-field/">Dropping OpenAI Advice field, Adding Question field</a> (Fri Apr 28, 2023)
<br/>This post explores the process of deleting advice fields from a journaling system and replacing them with more interesting questions. It also details how OpenAI's feedback is used to measure success with tools such as web browsers, CURL, and the Python Requests package. The post will be available soon at the provided URL.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/my-secret-daily-work-journal-now-more-yaml-like/">My Secret Daily Work Journal now More YAML-like</a> (Thu Apr 20, 2023)
<br/>I've created a new journaling format that uses YAML-like front-matter and a few transformations. I just hit a button, but the 1-page journal.md where I edit all my blog posts at once gets sliced & diced into individual Jekyll-style posts, gets AI suggested headline, meta description and keywords, then rolls it all back into journal.md for further editing, revision and refinement. Come see how!</li>

<br/>I've been blogging and vlogging since 2007, sharing my thoughts and ideas without worrying about editing or technical matters. I use YouTube and blogging to express myself and get feedback, and I don't edit my videos for views. I write and publish my work in vim, and use Bing ChatBot to format it in markdown. Join me on my journey and read my work to get insight into my ideas.</li>

<br/>I discuss the potential of using AI at home with now cheap GPUs, exploring the improved efficiency, enhanced security, better health monitoring, and entertainment and education it can provide. Additionally, I explore potential ways to make money by promoting the ideas and benefits of AI at home, such as through affiliate marketing, advertising, consulting, and e-commerce. I also provide a code example of how to use Puppeteer or Playwright to capture the full vertical scroll.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/turning-repo-into-nbdev-project/">Turning Repo into nbdev Project</a> (Tue Apr 26, 2022)
<br/>I created a GitHub repo for my project, blogslicer, and connected it to my local directory. After editing the settings.ini file, I moved and renamed the notebook into the repo, added the necessary cells and comments for nbdev, and attempted to publish the project. Finally, I altered pythonically.com to not use index.md as the journal. Read my blog post to learn how I did it!</li>
<li><a href="/blog/jekyll-include-tags-for-github-io-youtube-embedding/">Jekyll include tags for Github.io YouTube Embedding</a> (Fri Aug 20, 2021)
<br/>I'm developing new habits to become an expert in technical moves and live-streaming. To make sure nothing proprietary is shared, I'm setting up hotkeys and testing embedding YouTube videos in my Github.io pages. I'm also creating mikelevinseo.com as a place to write about topics instead of my main journal. Click through to read more about my journey.</li>
