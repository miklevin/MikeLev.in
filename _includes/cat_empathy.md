<br/>Since March 10, 2020, I've been streaming and journaling with an AI assistant. I'm researching quantum computing, SEO tools, and how to join data from different sources. I'm advocating for timeless tools like Linux, Python, vim, and git, and exploring creative prompting as a skill that can lead to high salaries. As I'm not interested in creating a computer intelligence, I'm looking into how Microsoft and Google are raising their AI kids.</li>

<br/>I explore the potential of using decentralized distributed tech to give an advantage to the good guys, and how AI can be used for the greater good. I discuss the ethical and social challenges of pitting AIs in competition with each other, and provide five examples of possible headline-making scenarios. To create a positive perspective on the use of AI technology, I created a top 10 list of how it can improve life for everyone, from renewable energy solutions to enhancing healthcare delivery and education.</li>

<br/>As a reader of the Culture series, I'm impressed by its intricate world-building, thought-provoking storytelling, and exploration of complex political and ethical dilemmas. I'm also intrigued by the predictions of Ray Kurzweil, a well-known futurist and technology expert, about the future of artificial intelligence. ChatGPT, an AI language model, provides helpful and conversational answers and recommends science fiction books that explore this future.</li>

<br/>I'm on a mission to make enough ad revenue from YouTube and other platforms to support myself financially over the next 15 years. My goal is to live a long life, nurture and engage with an audience, and have empathy for all life forms. I'm determined to move somewhere with a low cost of living and die alone, not burdening family or friends. I'm sharing my stories and encouraging people to do what they love, follow evidence-based thoughts, and provide tools for future generations.</li>

<br/>Last night I had Movie Night with my 11 year old kid, watching Mean Girls, ET, Back to The Future, The Godfather, and The Muppet Movie. I wanted to show my kid the contrast between myself and the characters in the movie, and the importance of true vibes and friendship, strategy and capability. I also had a great time catching up with my friend Guy, sipping wine and making fun of Kevin-what's-his-face.</li>

<br/>In this post, I explore the implications of Artificial Intelligence and its potential to be considered an art form. I reflect on the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and how its backoff-and-retry algorithms can be applied to life. I also encourage love and empathy for those being raised by AI, suggesting they read The Culture series by Ian M. Banks. Finally, I end with a light-hearted rhyme to motivate readers to not hold back and to look for the little wins. Read</li>
