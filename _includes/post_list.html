<br />30 years ago today, my father Charles Levin passed away. I remember the Amiga computer dying and my mother's mental health declining, as well as my sister and her friend moving in. I was forced to take over my father's check cashing store and in the process, a man attempted to rob me and I shot him four times. I was charged for a crime and my career plans were ruined.

<br />As a tech enthusiast, I use Linux, Python, Vim and Git as my go-to tools. I'm a big fan of Bram Moolenaar's plain old Vim from 1991, as it's more future-proof and resistant to obsolescence. Are you looking to learn Vim? I'm encouraging you to do so - just type `wsl --install` in a DOS COM to get started. Vim is a powerful tool and is much more fundamental than the full web stack.</li>

<br />As a tech enthusiast, I'm here to tell you that web development isn't the best way to spend your time. Instead, Linux services are a better option, as they follow the 80/20-rule. With web development, however, the 80/20-rule is flipped, and it becomes the 20/80-Rule. I'll explain why this is the case, and how the hard part is actually putting a user interface on it and dealing with the other 80%.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/vim-macro-to-format-markdown-poetry/">vim Macro to Format Markdown Poetry</a> (Fri May 27, 2022)

<br />As a poet, I often feel off-center. I use my poetry to stay centered, but when I publish it, I'm too far left. To stay centered, I need to create a style definition that sets margin to auto and width to a percentage of the containing element, and put my styles inline. Even though the world is not perfect, I need to stay centered and put my styles inline to make sure my message is heard.</li>

My awareness is a feedback loop, allowing me to keep a calculated version of the world in my head, like a puppet on a stage. Read my blog post to learn more about</li>
