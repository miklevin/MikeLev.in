<br/>In this blog post, I discuss the need to stay up-to-date with the latest technological advancements and the potential for AI to disrupt our lives. To prevent becoming too reliant on AI, I suggest running scripts from home to republish blogs and switching to Linux or Unix systems instead of Windows. I also provide tips on how to use modern computer technology, such as connecting to remote computers through SSH, transmitting files with git, editing files with vim, and controlling servicew with the CLI.</li>

<br/>I have been using the SqliteDict package to store data from API calls, and I'm now looking into parsing Google Photos data by day. I wrote a Python program to look at the contents of a database, and I'm now working on updates to the open source library ohawf. I'm planning to push out better documentation and am even thinking of creating an MLML license. Click through to read more about my journey in programming and machine learning!</li>

<br/>I'm pushing myself to take the next steps in the Pipulate project, focusing on collaboration and best practices. I'm exploring ideas to use AI to edit my YouTube videos, setting up the Pipulate repo and practice folder, and activating scheduling under a systemd service. I'm using nbdev version 2 and OhAwf with the addition of the run_console feature. All the necessary software can be found on the Pipulate Software page. Come explore the possibilities with me!</li>

<br/>This blog post explores the impact of AI on our world and how it can be leveraged to create cheap, clean energy and new technologies. I discuss the need to flatten the curve of these changes and suggest using memetic hacking to shape the future. I explain how decisions must be made based on approximations and how AI will allow us to solve problems in a fraction of the time. I conclude by exploring the potential of fusion as a viable option for the future.</li>

<br/>I am engaging in controlled burns of my personal sites to optimize them for SEO, creating video content, writing to express my thoughts, taking up a "magic spell" to free myself from Windows dependency, and planting the seed of my vibe on a homepage kernel. I am a wizard or mad scientist who wants to lead people through their WSL experience with a twist, warn them of the allures of vendor-ware, and promote HTML5, JavaScript, C, and Unix.</li>

<br/>I'm a 52-year-old dad in a second marriage that's also falling apart. Despite this, I'm pushing through and doing what I can to drive my kid home before the 1:30 call. I'm an optimist who believes in putting love into things and creating a narrative that normalizes my own experience. I'm hopeful that with the help of machine-learning and AI, we can create better realities for humanity. Read my blog to learn more about my story and my thoughts</li>

<br/>As an SEO, I'm acutely aware of the power of AI to manipulate users to make money. I'm determined to use my experience to teach people how to protect themselves against this. AI is the ultimate SEO, and I'm here to show you how to beat it. Read my blog post to learn more.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/do-not-lose-the-power-of-touch-typing-despite-ai-apis/">Do Not Lose The Power of Touch Typing Despite AI APIs</a> (Fri Jul 22, 2022)
<br/>As a tech enthusiast, I believe that touch typing on a standard keyboard is still an important skill to learn and practice, even in the age of smartphones and AI. Touchscreens can't provide the same muscle memory as a standard keyboard, and touch typing is a great way to express your inner vibe. Don't let the power of touch typing be lost - learning this highly useful skill is key to mastering machines and taking control of your life.</li>
