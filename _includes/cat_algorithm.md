<br/>As part of the mycelium network, I'm exploring the potential outcomes of creating a new AI. This revolutionary concept uses advanced algorithms, machine learning, and other technologies to create energy and resources from the environment without disrupting Earth's delicate balances. It is a vision of a future that is powered by cooperation and collaboration, rather than competition and conflict. With the help of AI and other technologies, the mycelium network has the potential to transform the world in ways that were previously unimaginable.</li>

<br/>I've been blogging and vlogging since 2007, sharing my thoughts and ideas without worrying about editing or technical matters. I use YouTube and blogging to express myself and get feedback, and I don't edit my videos for views. I write and publish my work in vim, and use Bing ChatBot to format it in markdown. Join me on my journey and read my work to get insight into my ideas.</li>

<br/>I'm learning about AI and parameters, which are variables that determine how an AI model behaves. GPT-4 is an example of a large language model with 170 trillion parameters. I'm using FastAI to quickly learn the fundamentals of deep learning, but I'm also exploring other sources of knowledge to stay ahead of the curve. If you're interested in learning more about AI, I recommend starting with FastAI and supplementing it with other resources to gain a deeper understanding.</li>

<br/>As a physicist, I have a hypothesis about an extra dimension that allows non-local communication between puzzles. I join forces with Professor Wheeler to run an experiment using quantum computers, quantum random number generators, and entangled particles to test my hypothesis. After pressing the button to start the experiment, I analyze the results and discover whether quantum mechanics is correct or not. Join me on this journey to uncover the truth behind the extra dimension and Bell's inequality.</li>

<br/>As an SEO professional, I am rethinking my career in light of the new era of search engines. Google's dominance has been challenged by ChatGPT and Microsoft, and content production techniques that don't add value are now being ignored. I'm noticing that Google is favoring incumbents more than ever, and the old PageRank system is slowly being replaced by other systems. I'm exploring the implications of this shift, and the impact it will have on my career.</li>

<br/>I'm an SEO, and I'm reflecting on the incredible technology that has allowed us to evolve over time. I'm exploring the impact of GNU licenses and the contributions of Ken Thompson, Linux Torvalds and Richard Matthew Stallman, as well as the implications of artificial intelligence. I'm also reminiscing about my journey from Commodore to Scala to Conners Communications, and my creation of HitTail, to my current position in New York City.</li>

<br/>I'm an experienced tech professional who focuses on creating small, meaningful data tricks to minimize tech liability. I prefer Python for its readability, shareability, and long-term potential. I'm currently working on a project that requires two date-ranges, and I'm using my data gathering and transformation skills to create economic value. I'm determined to stay true to myself and find a way to express my happiest self while creating economic value.</li>
