<br/>Discover how deep learning and game theory can be used together to create more effective AI solutions. In this blog post, I discuss the potential applications of deep learning to game theory and the importance of collaboration between the two disciplines. I also explain how game theory can help to model and solve various deep learning problems, and how AI can create competitive pressures for content providers. Finally, I explore how deep language learning models can make the web more transparent and accountable by providing evidence and sources for their claims.</li>

<br/>This blog post explores the evidence for quantum computing and quantum supremacy, as well as the events that could provide absolute proof that quantum computing is not false. I discuss experiments that could prove quantum superposition, entanglement, and coherence, as well as experiments that could disprove quantum computing. I also discuss theories such as the energy-momentum relation, wave-particle duality, the Schr√∂dinger equation, and the many-worlds interpretation.</li>

<br/>I'm exploring the possibility that Skinny Bob type aliens may be from an extra-dimensional reality or consciousness, and I'm considering four different scenarios to explain their origin. I've given each scenario a score out of 10, and I'm looking for corroborating evidence to verify my findings. Join me on my journey to uncover the truth about Skinny Bob type aliens!</li>

<br/>This article explores the UFO community and examines the evidence, credibility, and profiteering of people like Kenneth Arnold, Bob Lazar, George Knapp, and John Lear. I share my personal experience with a secret program to investigate UFOs and discuss who may be the most likely fakers and profiteers in the UFO community. Read on to learn more and ask me any questions you have about these people.</li>

<br/>I was asked a difficult question about calculating the odds of New Horizons's equipment failure, so I suggested looking it up online. My conversation partner then asked who I would target if I could read minds, and I chose David Fravor, a retired naval pilot who witnessed a UFO sighting in 2004. In response to the implications of my question, I apologize and suggest a better way to get evidence is to conduct a rigorous and transparent scientific investigation.</li>

<br/>Today is the day to put my rotating logo back on the homepage with a bit of animation. I believe that life is a delicate balance of pushing past the hard bits, thinking clearly, journaling, using the 80/20-rule, and avoiding rabbit-holes. We must also be aware of the false dichotomies that label people and the power of those who oppose peace. Times are changing and the public is being held down, but I'm confident that we can break through.</li>
