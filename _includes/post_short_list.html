<br />Learn how to use RegEx in NeoVim to format Markdown quotes with 2 trailing spaces. I describe the process of using Vim commands to back up my journal and the paradigm of writing and editing text with vi/vim/NeoVim. I also discuss my journey with the Midjourney AI, including the Microsoft Store installation, the paid account link, and the documentation link.</li>

<br />Explore the concept of self-similarity, from fractals to the behavior of subatomic particles, and discover how it is embedded into the universe. Learn the implications of self-similarity on human consciousness and the universe, as discussed by Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor and Stephen Hawking. Dive into this fascinating concept with this post and learn more about convergent evolution.</li>

<br />The advent of AI-generated content has created a new challenge for search engines to organize the infinite new glutton of information in a useful way. I discuss the need for us content producers to find ways to stand out from the 'infinite spam cannon' and offer solutions for optimizing our content to be recognized and rewarded by search engines.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/simulation-hypothesis-or-not-is-a-false-dichotomy/">Simulation Hypothesis Or Not is a False Dichotomy</a> (Sun May 07, 2023)
<br />In this out-there post, I explore the idea that the dichotomy between the Simulation Hypothesis and reality is false. My journey has led me to explore the potential of reality-hacks. I believe that Intelligent Design is a valid theory, scientifically falsifiable as it is (it hasn't been yet), and that even the nonfalsifiable stuff of art and magic is fun to explore. My ambition is to find the best path to a game well played.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/category-mapping-go-ascii-alice/">Category Mapping? Go ASCII Alice!</a> (Sun May 07, 2023)
<br />I'm implementing a more controlled and explicit category system for my blog, by mapping keywords to top categories and sub-categories. This post explains the process and code I used to create a dictionary to map each keyword to its parent category. I'm also exploring the potential for deeper hierarchies and ontological, taxonomy and canonicalization issues.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/more-deliberate-with-category-mapping/">More Deliberate With Category Mapping</a> (Sat May 06, 2023)
<br />I'm optimizing my blog post categorization system by grouping common keywords into parent categories. I'm learning about YAML dictionaries and sub-dictionaries to create a nested structure for my categories. I'm also making sure to keep the list of categories as short as possible by using the lemmatized version of words. Finally, I'm working on a custom object shape to keep the categorization system running smoothly.</li>

<br />Explore the idea of intelligent amplification and the potential of AI with this blog post. Learn about the implications of the Cambrian explosion and the possibility of an AI apocalypse. Discover how to improve website user experience by extracting cohesive linear topical sequences.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/reverse-chronological-writing-is-the-natural-order/">Reverse Chronological Writing is the Natural Order</a> (Sat May 06, 2023)
<br />I explore how reverse chronological writing is the natural order for blogging. I discuss the history of writing, how technology has changed the way we write, and the instinctive feeling of starting with a blank page that comes with reverse chronological order. This is the format that satisfies our human need to start at the top of a blank page every time.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/left-is-the-past-and-right-is-the-future-right-blog-arrows/">Left is The Past and Right is The Future, Right? (Blog Arrows)</a> (Fri May 05, 2023)
<br />I'm exploring the beauty and logic of arrow navigation. It can take some finagling to get it right, but it's a great 80/20-rule solution. With a configurable option, I'm able to make it so that the 'past' is left, and the 'future' is right - perfect for website navigation.</li>
