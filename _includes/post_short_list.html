<br />The advent of AI-generated content has created a new challenge for search engines to organize the infinite new glutton of information in a useful way. I discuss the need for us content producers to find ways to stand out from the 'infinite spam cannon' and offer solutions for optimizing our content to be recognized and rewarded by search engines.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/simulation-hypothesis-or-not-is-a-false-dichotomy/">Simulation Hypothesis Or Not is a False Dichotomy</a> (Sun May 07, 2023)
<br />In this out-there post, I explore the idea that the dichotomy between the Simulation Hypothesis and reality is false. My journey has led me to explore the potential of reality-hacks. I believe that Intelligent Design is a valid theory, scientifically falsifiable as it is (it hasn't been yet), and that even the nonfalsifiable stuff of art and magic is fun to explore. My ambition is to find the best path to a game well played.</li>

<br />I'm implementing a more controlled and explicit category system for my blog, by mapping keywords to top categories and sub-categories. This post explains the process and code I used to create a dictionary to map each keyword to its parent category. I'm also exploring the potential for deeper hierarchies and ontological, taxonomy and canonicalization issues.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/more-deliberate-with-category-mapping/">More Deliberate With Category Mapping</a> (Sat May 06, 2023)
<br />I'm optimizing my blog post categorization system by grouping common keywords into parent categories. I'm learning about YAML dictionaries and sub-dictionaries to create a nested structure for my categories. I'm also making sure to keep the list of categories as short as possible by using the lemmatized version of words. Finally, I'm working on a custom object shape to keep the categorization system running smoothly.</li>

<li><a href="/blog/reverse-chronological-writing-is-the-natural-order/">Reverse Chronological Writing is the Natural Order</a> (Sat May 06, 2023)
<br />I explore how reverse chronological writing is the natural order for blogging. I discuss the history of writing, how technology has changed the way we write, and the instinctive feeling of starting with a blank page that comes with reverse chronological order. This is the format that satisfies our human need to start at the top of a blank page every time.</li>
