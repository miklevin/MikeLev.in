<br />This post follows a developer as they explore the default behavior of an M2 Mac and prepare to write a Mac DrinkMe install procedure. Through the post, they investigate the install procedure and test the Mac's features, including virtual desktops, Safari's Rapid Security Response, and the ability to open apps from unidentified developers. They also discover the Mac's built-in screen recording feature.</li>

<br />I explored a litany of ways including the formal ones to prevent Linux systemd services from going down under WSL. After trying the .wslconfig and wsl.conf files, a systemd .service file, a cron job and .bashrc, I finally a added the nohup ping busy-task to .bash_profile to keep Linux services running under WSL2. But at a price.</li>

<br />I'm refining my pre-productivity tooling with intense focus. I'm observing, enumerating errors, and writing down clues to help me find the right place in my code. I'm curling and copying, and experimenting with new techniques to get the script to function properly. After many iterations, I'm ready to take a break and attend an art exhibit in New York City. I'm also exploring ways to keep WSL from going to sleep in the background.</li>
