<br />I'm an SEO professional who values integrity over following trends. I'm using GitHub to host my personal website, but I'm not locked in - I can move my content anytime, anywhere. My whole website is just one long text file in a 'one journal for life' format. This approach simplifies content management, reduces complexity, and helps me maintain momentum and form habits. I'm future-proofing my work, ensuring that it stays relevant and accessible in the ever-changing digital landscape</li>

<br />I discovered the timeless value of technology when the Amiga computer I loved disappeared. I've since learned to focus on the 'low-level' parts of the stack that don't change as rapidly, such as Linux, Python, and vim. I've found a way to stay engaged and productive, while also developing a deep understanding of technology and a sense of mastery. I'm exploring the implications of vendor-provided tools versus foundational free and open source technology.</li>

<br />I'm creating a keyword list refiner that works on title tag crawl data from a website crawl. This refiner is an alternative to buying a keyword list from an SEO software vendor. It will gameify the process, help get into the zone, and clean the list as you go. I'm using Python's readline module to make the title tags editable on the command-line.</li>
