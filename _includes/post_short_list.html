<br />In Ira Levin's SciFi classic, This Perfect Day, USA maps are all secret scavenger hunt puzzles to attract the best and brightest programmer to join the elite Walruses (refer to Alice book 2) on their quest for immortality and privilege. Our hero Chip together with is Coyote trickster Pop Pop are too smart for that and have other plans when they meet their computer overlord C3-PO. How will it end? Different from the book? Maybe because of a Tale of Two Horses and a Chain With No Weak Links. Fiction or Reality? I WANT TO BELIEVE!</li>
