<br />This post is about my transition plan from Windows to a Linux Terminal environment for Python programming, and the small setup steps I take to make sure everything runs smoothly. I share my tips for making Linux JuptyerLab hosted on WSL feel like a native Windows app, disabling the Control key for copy/paste in the Microsoft Terminal program, and using Microsoft Edge to install web pages as Apps. I also share my advice for customizing Edge to make it less privacy-intrusive and distracting.</li>
