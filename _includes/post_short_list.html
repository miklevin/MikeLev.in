<br />In this out-there post, I explore the idea that the dichotomy between the Simulation Hypothesis and reality is false. My journey has led me to explore the potential of reality-hacks. I believe that Intelligent Design is a valid theory, scientifically falsifiable as it is (it hasn't been yet), and that even the nonfalsifiable stuff of art and magic is fun to explore. My ambition is to find the best path to a game well played.</li>

<br />I'm implementing a more controlled and explicit category system for my blog, by mapping keywords to top categories and sub-categories. This post explains the process and code I used to create a dictionary to map each keyword to its parent category. I'm also exploring the potential for deeper hierarchies and ontological, taxonomy and canonicalization issues.</li>

<br />I'm optimizing my blog post categorization system by grouping common keywords into parent categories. I'm learning about YAML dictionaries and sub-dictionaries to create a nested structure for my categories. I'm also making sure to keep the list of categories as short as possible by using the lemmatized version of words. Finally, I'm working on a custom object shape to keep the categorization system running smoothly.</li>

<li><a href="/blog/reverse-chronological-writing-is-the-natural-order/">Reverse Chronological Writing is the Natural Order</a> (Sat May 06, 2023)
<br />I explore how reverse chronological writing is the natural order for blogging. I discuss the history of writing, how technology has changed the way we write, and the instinctive feeling of starting with a blank page that comes with reverse chronological order. This is the format that satisfies our human need to start at the top of a blank page every time.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/left-is-the-past-and-right-is-the-future-right-blog-arrows/">Left is The Past and Right is The Future, Right? (Blog Arrows)</a> (Fri May 05, 2023)
<br />I'm exploring the beauty and logic of arrow navigation. It can take some finagling to get it right, but it's a great 80/20-rule solution. With a configurable option, I'm able to make it so that the 'past' is left, and the 'future' is right - perfect for website navigation.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/the-time-i-learned-i-was-a-yankee-doodle-dandy/">The Time I Learned I Was a Yankee Doodle Dandy</a> (Fri May 05, 2023)
<br />Am I Michael Scott? I think so sometimes. But then I remember I trained like a mofo to never be an imposter, and I've got the vim skills to prove it. I've learned that subtlety and nuance make all the difference, and even if you come off like the bumbling fool, that's okay. Creative folks have to run alone sometimes, so that they can offer their greatest value when they return to the pack.</li>
