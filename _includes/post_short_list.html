<br />This article started out as a humble little interactive session with Bing AI helping me get a new website off the ground that I'm launching today &#151; one that you should all check out if you want to future-proof yourself as AI rises. But then, I realized that Bing was "phantom clicking" the thumbs-up button on its own responses, and I captured the whole thing in this video!</li>

<br />This post is about consolidating the MyKoz.AI journaling system under one repository. I discuss the need to update the `.bash_profile` to include `sudo hwclock -s`, the need to create a `README.txt` file, and the decision to use one repo with the folders Intro, Journal, Practice, and Service. This is the preparatory work before MyKoz.AI can really be soft-launched. These repo's and particularly the Journaling system need to be in-place.</li>

<br />I'm a fan of the tools I use, and the toolmakers who make them. I'm a fan of Linux, Python, vim & git, and I'm deeply moved by Bram Moolenaar's death. I'm on a journey to the Noosphere, and MyKoz.AI is my Noosphere endeavor. I'm doing this by adding a Linux subsystem serving JupyterLab to existing Windows 10 or 11 desktops, optionally starting fresh with a 'Reset this PC' approach. I'm packaging it to be appealing to the masses: a path for those determined to master tools for life on a continuous journey of self-improvement.</li>

<br />Today I refined MyKoz.AI, a foray into Linux, Python, vim & git for the uninitiated. I learned that Bram Moolenaar, the creator of vim, passed away. I'm Twitch streaming the creation of this endeavor, breaking it down into interesting topics like hosting or headless CMS. I'm working on the readme outputting, the Introduction repository, and the NeoVim path. I'm trying use the 80/20-Rule.</li>
