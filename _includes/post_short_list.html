<br />I explore how reverse chronological writing is the natural order for blogging. I discuss the history of writing, how technology has changed the way we write, and the instinctive feeling of starting with a blank page that comes with reverse chronological order. This is the format that satisfies our human need to start at the top of a blank page every time.</li>

I've learned that subtlety and nuance make all the difference, and even if you come off like the bumbling fool, that's okay. Creative folks have to run alone sometimes, so that they can offer their greatest value when they return to the pack.</li>
