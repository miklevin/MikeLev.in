<br />The Legend of The Bat looms big in my head, even though I started out as a Marvel Comics guy, when Frank Miller's industry-changing Dark Knight Returns graphic novel came out in 1986, I held my nose and switched to DC and followed a number of Batman titles&#151;few of which made a bigger impression on me than the one of Azrael of The Order of St. Dumas who went into fugue states to make gadgets. It's how poetry works with me.</li>

<br />I'm an SME at MOZ and I'm sharing my best tricks for managing hundreds of lightweight blog posts using the yamlchop repo on Github. I'm using the yamlchop/chop.py tool to split them into individual files and OpenAI to generate headlines, meta descriptions, and keywords. With this system, I'm able to create previous and next arrows with the exact wording of my title tags in the links.</li>
