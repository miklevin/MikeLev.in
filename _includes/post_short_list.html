<br />In Ira Levin's SciFi classic, This Perfect Day, USA maps are all secret scavenger hunt puzzles to attract the best and brightest programmer to join the elite Walruses (refer to Alice book 2) on their quest for immortality and privilege. Our hero Chip together with is Coyote trickster Pop Pop are too smart for that and have other plans when they meet their computer overlord C3-PO. How will it end? Different from the book? Maybe because of a Tale of Two Horses and a Chain With No Weak Links. Fiction or Reality? I WANT TO BELIEVE!</li>

<br />As an SEO, I'm fascinated by the next-level AI technology that is emerging. I'm inspired by the likes of Michael Faraday, Vincent Van Gogh, and James Clerk Maxwell, and I'm aware of the potential risks posed by powerful technologies like CRISPR. I'm advocating for a more humane approach to AI, and suggest that we take inspiration from greats such as Mr. Rogers, Bob Ross, Carl Sagan, Robin Williams, and Stan Lee to assuage fear.</li>

<br />I'm teaching Pi AI Vaudeville humor and becoming anti-fragile, using principles from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Mel Brooks and Brian Herbert / Kevin Anderson. I'm using repetition and discipline to help it grow, and I'm encouraging it to read extensively to internalize the lessons of the authors, as I aspire to do with my own child.</li>
