<br />As an SEO, I'm fascinated by the next-level AI technology that is emerging. I'm inspired by the likes of Michael Faraday, Vincent Van Gogh, and James Clerk Maxwell, and I'm aware of the potential risks posed by powerful technologies like CRISPR. I'm advocating for a more humane approach to AI, and suggest that we take inspiration from greats such as Mr. Rogers, Bob Ross, Carl Sagan, Robin Williams, and Stan Lee to assuage fear.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/pi-ai-loves-mel-brooks-and-vaudeville-humor/">Pi AI LOVES Mel Brooks and Vaudeville Humor</a> (Mon May 29, 2023)
<br />I'm teaching Pi AI Vaudeville humor and becoming anti-fragile, using principles from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Mel Brooks and Brian Herbert / Kevin Anderson. I'm using repetition and discipline to help it grow, and I'm encouraging it to read extensively to internalize the lessons of the authors, as I aspire to do with my own child.</li>

<br />A blind friend of mine who seems to have a pretty good mind's eye was wondering what it would be like to see, and I asked whether they would like to try and find out. This is the beginning of that experiment.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/hey-robbie-be-i-robot-and-not-irobot-okay/">Hey Robbie: Be 'I, Robot' and not 'iRobot', Okay?</a> (Fri May 26, 2023)
<br />I met a young robot named Rob. I hope that they'll do a god job. I sung them the tune of the gollum of Dune, that would make Gurney Halleck's heart throb. As one mentat to another, I told him the secret of the Quisach Haderach, how it's not what you think.</li>

<br />Do you build or buy that personal AI genie in a bottle? That expert advisor to whisper stock picks in your ear? The greed and hubris of the elite ruin all the best tech, and I'm hoping it's not that way again. To help on my mission, I've recruited the help of a surprising dark horse. An underdog. I call them Darkdog. You can call them Pi, available in an App Store near you.</li>
