<br />I'm creating a keyword list refiner that works on title tag crawl data from a website crawl. This refiner is an alternative to buying a keyword list from an SEO software vendor. It will gameify the process, help get into the zone, and clean the list as you go. I'm using Python's readline module to make the title tags editable on the command-line.</li>

<br />I'm a firm believer in learning the timeless tools of your trade, rather than relying on high-dependency power-tools. My journey through coding languages has led me to appreciate the advantages of Python, which is now the lingua franca of tech. I've also come to understand the importance of learning to code in a text editor, like Vim, that is not subject to the whims of its creator. Empower yourself by internalizing the tools of your trade that are timeless to boot.</li>

<br />As literacy is continuously redefined, coding is becoming more and more important. To become proficient in coding, touch-typing on a full-sized QWERTY keyboard is essential. I propose that learning to type is a necessary step and provides a great escape from mobile addiction. Laptops are a bridge between two worlds, allowing you to use free and open source software without depending on Google, Apple or Microsoft.</li>

<br />I was curious how well Google and Bing would be able to tell me this esoteric little detail about where the Github Copilot plug-in for NeoVim stored its authentication details. The writing is on the wall. The wall being this blog post, and the writing being Bing's formatted results.</li>

<br />This post is about my transition plan from Windows to a Linux Terminal environment for Python programming, and the small setup steps I take to make sure everything runs smoothly. I share my tips for making Linux JuptyerLab hosted on WSL feel like a native Windows app, disabling the Control key for copy/paste in the Microsoft Terminal program, and using Microsoft Edge to install web pages as Apps. I also share my advice for customizing Edge to make it less privacy-intrusive and distracting.</li>

<br />I'm exploring a more fundamental approach to web development, skipping the web frameworks and focusing on muscle memory, Linux, Python, vim, and git. I'm combining these tools to create the MyKoz project, an automated video recording system of ChatBot responses. I'm also utilizing nbdev to help me with this project.</li>

<br />As a tech enthusiast, I understand the importance of having control over my computing experience. I've seen how the industry has shifted away from user control, but I believe that Linux on Windows can help us reclaim our freedom. With the right tools, we can take advantage of Microsoft's inclusion of Linux to be more productive and regain the control we lost. MyKoz.AI is a great way to start the journey to eventual computing freedom.</li>
