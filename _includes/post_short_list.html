Empower yourself by internalizing the tools of your trade that are timeless to boot.</li>

I propose that learning to type is a necessary step and provides a great escape from mobile addiction. Laptops are a bridge between two worlds, allowing you to use free and open source software without depending on Google, Apple or Microsoft.</li>
