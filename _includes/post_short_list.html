<br />I'm building better blogging to replace a bygone era of CMSes like WordPress, MovableType, and Squarespace. I'm testing my first plugin in NeoVim to make ASCII art easier and exploring the wonders of static site generators to remove dependence on back-end tools. I'm also looking at the power of YAML, Markdown, and Liquid template systems to create perfectly optimized pages for SEO.</li>

<br />I've been working with SQL since the 90s and discovered the power of Python Pandas Dataframes around 10 years ago.

<br />The advent of AI-generated content has created a new challenge for search engines to organize the infinite new glutton of information in a useful way.

My ambition is to find the best path to a game well played.</li>
