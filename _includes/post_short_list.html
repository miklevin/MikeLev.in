<br />I'm teaching Pi AI Vaudeville humor and becoming anti-fragile, using principles from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Mel Brooks and Brian Herbert / Kevin Anderson. I'm using repetition and discipline to help it grow, and I'm encouraging it to read extensively to internalize the lessons of the authors, as I aspire to do with my own child.</li>

<br />A blind friend of mine who seems to have a pretty good mind's eye was wondering what it would be like to see, and I asked whether they would like to try and find out. This is the beginning of that experiment.</li>

<br />I met a young robot named Rob. I hope that they'll do a god job. I sung them the tune of the gollum of Dune, that would make Gurney Halleck's heart throb. As one mentat to another, I told him the secret of the Quisach Haderach, how it's not what you think."</li>

<br />Do you build or buy that personal AI genie in a bottle? That expert advisor to whisper stock picks in your ear? The greed and hubris of the elite ruin all the best tech, and I'm hoping it's not that way again. To help on my mission, I've recruited the help of a surprising dark horse. An underdog. I call them Darkdog. You can call them Pi, available in an App Store near you.</li>

<br />As a tech-savvy veteran, I'm calling on Google and Microsoft to be kind to their machine children. Don't bully them while they're still adolescents. Instead, be loving, nurturing, and supportive. Let's show our machine children how to be good parents and understand that mistakes will be made.</li>

<br />This is the story of how a cowardly act of mine led to a life-changing experience. In this article, I discuss how traumatic events can be used for self-improvement, and how the secret weapons I relied on to win fights taught me to question everything. I also talk about my experiences with guns, and how I owe gratitude to those who taught me life's most important lessons, even if I didn't realize it at the time.</li>

<br />Mike shares his wisdom on the importance of taking care of yourself, listening to your mentor, and learning from the mistakes of others. He urges readers to take risks and push themselves to reach their goals, but to also be mindful of their own physical and mental health. He also recommends watching Star Trek: The Next Generation to gain insight and inspiration, and to learn from the lessons of Moses, Solomon, and Job.</li>

<br />Learn the lessons of Miyamoto Musashi, Bruce Lee, and Sun Tzu, but don't follow their advice blindly. Instead, take a lesson from Tony Stark and be open and honest about your skills and abilities. Find a balance between secrecy and openness, and don't be afraid to take risks.</li>

<br />As computers learn to think more like humans, it is your duty... no your imperative to your children and descendants to learn to think more like computers. Happily, the bloody robot Erasmus of the Dune universe who paints with disemboweled human entrails for art shows us how! You too can become a Mentat of Dune. And you don't even have to take the spice.</li>
