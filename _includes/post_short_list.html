<br />This post is about consolidating the MyKoz.AI journaling system under one repository. I discuss the need to update the `.bash_profile` to include `sudo hwclock -s`, the need to create a `README.txt` file, and the decision to use one repo with the folders Intro, Journal, Practice, and Service. This is the preparatory work before MyKoz.AI can really be soft-launched. These repo's and particularly the Journaling system need to be in-place.</li>

<br />I'm a fan of the tools I use, and the toolmakers who make them. I'm a fan of Linux, Python, vim & git, and I'm deeply moved by Bram Moolenaar's death. I'm on a journey to the Noosphere, and MyKoz.AI is my Noosphere endeavor. I'm doing this by adding a Linux subsystem serving JupyterLab to existing Windows 10 or 11 desktops, optionally starting fresh with a 'Reset this PC' approach. I'm packaging it to be appealing to the masses: a path for those determined to master tools for life on a continuous journey of self-improvement.</li>

<br />Today I refined MyKoz.AI, a foray into Linux, Python, vim & git for the uninitiated. I learned that Bram Moolenaar, the creator of vim, passed away. I'm Twitch streaming the creation of this endeavor, breaking it down into interesting topics like hosting or headless CMS. I'm working on the readme outputting, the Introduction repository, and the NeoVim path. I'm trying use the 80/20-Rule.</li>

<li><a href="/blog/the-tow-it-ism-tech-philosophy/">The Tow-It-Ism Tech Philosophy</a> (Sun Aug 06, 2023)
<br />I'm introducing a new tech philosophy I call Tow-It-Ism, which is about not needing much in the way of tools or vendor support to be effective with information technology. It's about going back to basics and getting to the heart of what makes Unix and Linux so powerful, and embracing the free and open source software (FOSS) ecosystem. With this approach, you can cultivate self-reflection, mindfulness, and build an internalized set of skills that will benefit you for life.</li>
