<br />I'm introducing a new tech philosophy I call Tow-It-Ism, which is about not needing much in the way of tools or vendor support to be effective with information technology. It's about going back to basics and getting to the heart of what makes Unix and Linux so powerful, and embracing the free and open source software (FOSS) ecosystem. With this approach, you can cultivate self-reflection, mindfulness, and build an internalized set of skills that will benefit you for life.</li>
