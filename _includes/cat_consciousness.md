<br/>I attempted to learn how to use the `git rebase` command to clean up my git history and speed up my repository. I discovered on big repos with lots of issues, it's easier to just `git init` and do the old swaparoo with a new repo. Also explore philosophical questions about existence and the relative importance of things, and relationship to retiring an old git repo and starting anew.</li>

<br/>I'm exploring the possibility that Skinny Bob type aliens may be from an extra-dimensional reality or consciousness, and I'm considering four different scenarios to explain their origin. I've given each scenario a score out of 10, and I'm looking for corroborating evidence to verify my findings. Join me on my journey to uncover the truth about Skinny Bob type aliens!</li>

<br/>In this conversation with Bing, I explore the concept of intelligent design and its implications, the distinction between biological intelligence and consciousness, and the possibility of extra-dimensional communication. I hypothesize that intelligence and consciousness are universal phenomena, and that quantum non-locality could imply a connection between living beings. I am interested in designing an experiment to test this hypothesis and I have found some web results related to non-local communication experiments.</li>

<br/>I'm exploring linear algebra using Python, and I'm learning how to solve systems of linear equations, matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and singular value decomposition. With the help of NumPy, I'm gaining a better understanding of the concepts and applications of linear algebra. I'm also discovering the potential of AI language models, such as ChatGPT, which can help clarify my vision and provide information on TV programs like Person of Interest.</li>

<br/>As a reader of the Culture series, I'm impressed by its intricate world-building, thought-provoking storytelling, and exploration of complex political and ethical dilemmas. I'm also intrigued by the predictions of Ray Kurzweil, a well-known futurist and technology expert, about the future of artificial intelligence. ChatGPT, an AI language model, provides helpful and conversational answers and recommends science fiction books that explore this future.</li>

<br/>I recently had a life-changing realization that life is full of mysteries and that consciousness is still beyond science. This inspired me to plan a powerful spell that I will share with others, teaching them how to cast a spell of their own. Join me on my journey as I unlock the secrets of the universe and discover how to make magic happen.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/is-dark-energy-consciousness-choosing-gated-communities-over-heat-death/">Is Dark Energy Consciousness Choosing Gated Communities Over Heat Death?</a> (Wed Oct 26, 2022)
<br/>This article explores the possibility of dark energy consciousness existing in the universe and its implications for computing. I discuss the implications of digital electronics and how bifurcation can lead to exponential growth. I question the possibility of free-will in a seemingly deterministic system, ponder the idea of self-grown aliens, and consider the implications of a universe with an accelerating expansion that cannot be explained. Read on to explore these fascinating concepts and to discover what they mean for the future of computing.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/you-are-constantly-channeling/">You Are Constantly Channeling</a> (Sat May 07, 2022)
<br/>I'm constantly channeling, but I don't always recognize it. My sensitivity levels have been lowered for my own peace of mind, but that doesn't mean I'm not still receiving messages. In this blog post, I'm capturing a droplet of that messaging and sharing it with you, so you can understand how consciousness works and why it's important to pay attention to these signals. Come explore this new normal with me.</li>
