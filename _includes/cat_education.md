<br/>I'm a 52-year-old technology generalist who has been exploring the noosphere, the world of ideas and creativity. I've been building up my internal tools, such as Linux, Python, vim and git, to create potential. I'm now combining YAML and Markdown to create a 1-text-file journaling system that is more flexible and intuitive than other solutions. I'm exploring the power of text, and how it can be transformed and used to create something meaningful.</li>

<br/>As a reader, I am excited to explore the potential of six amazing technologies - fusion power, superconductivity, AI, biotechnology, quantum technology, and nanotechnology - and the risks and challenges associated with them. I understand the need for caution and responsibility when developing and using these technologies, as well as public awareness, education, and engagement. I look forward to a future where these technologies can help us create a world with clean and abundant energy, without harming the environment.</li>

<br/>I explore the potential of using decentralized distributed tech to give an advantage to the good guys, and how AI can be used for the greater good. I discuss the ethical and social challenges of pitting AIs in competition with each other, and provide five examples of possible headline-making scenarios. To create a positive perspective on the use of AI technology, I created a top 10 list of how it can improve life for everyone, from renewable energy solutions to enhancing healthcare delivery and education.</li>

<br/>I'm exploring linear algebra using Python, and I'm learning how to solve systems of linear equations, matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and singular value decomposition. With the help of NumPy, I'm gaining a better understanding of the concepts and applications of linear algebra. I'm also discovering the potential of AI language models, such as ChatGPT, which can help clarify my vision and provide information on TV programs like Person of Interest.</li>

<br/>Yesterday was a difficult day, but I'm determined to move forward. I'm rewriting my content management system and conditioning my mind to be kind and gentle. I'm supplementing my income while getting closer to my child, and using various tools to debug and fix a problem with a script. I wrote a program to create websites with Python and I'm using the blogslicer program to create blogs for multiple websites. I'm proud of the results of my task of fixing a bug and improving the output</li>
