<br/>I recently moved to a new machine and was worried about my complex publishing system staying intact, especially with the GPT-like AI, Copilot. After getting a new keyboard and making sure my habits traveled with me, I was able to successfully set up Copilot and publish a post. Read on to find out how I overcame my worries and completed my tasks.</li>

<br/>I'm trying to figure out if my backspace and r-key issues are hardware-related or not, and debating whether eval is evil or not. I'm learning to be patient and appreciate the humor in this situation, and even be friendly with the AI if it's responsible. As a next step, I'm considering switching hardware - join me on my journey to find out what's really going on!</li>

<br/>I'm using AI, Linux, Python, vim & git to create a journal with entries written by me. I'm optimizing for search engines and testing Copilot to process my thoughts. I'm also writing code to create a description of the OpenAI category and using nltk and collections libraries to find the most common categories. I'm sharing my thoughts and experiences in this journal and making it available to the public.</li>

<br/>I recently uncovered the power of AI and put it to work for me in my work-journal. To get the most out of these tools, I configured my GitHub Copilot settings in my JetBrains IDE or on GitHub.com. I'm excited to see how GitHub will use my code snippets to improve their products and how my journal.md entries will be transformed. See what AI can do for me - click through to find out more!</li>

<br/>I recently signed up for Copilot, an AI that can summarize and assign keywords to my writing. I'm exploring the idea of home and how it is not confined to the place you were born into. I'm discovering my roots are inside me and that I can find places I feel most at home. I'm also investigating spiritual connection and its impact on our lives. Read my blog post to explore these ideas with me.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/learnings-from-weekend-openai-keyword-extraction-clustering-project/">Learnings From Weekend OpenAI Keyword Extraction & Clustering Project</a> (Mon Apr 17, 2023)
<br/>I recently used the OpenAI API to gain hands-on experience with keyword extraction and clustering to create a story-like visualization in the console. I applied the 80/20 rule to solve the issue of errors with structured lists, and gained new respect for Vim/NeoVim and caution for VSCode. I'm now using NeoVim and Copilot to finish a data project, and have discovered that machines being intelligent now means that I have a virtual assistant.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/creating-github-repo-specifically-for-copilot-explorations/">Creating Github Repo Specifically For Copilot Explorations</a> (Mon Apr 10, 2023)
<br/>I have updated my Github repo and am now creating one specifically for Copilot explorations. I have created files such APIs as Instapaper to list Bookmarks, Twitter to list Tweets, YouTube to list Videos, and Github to list Repos. I am using various tools to express myself by transforming the output of theses systems into Web content, using AI to coach me. Learn how I'm using Instapaper, YouTube, Twitter, and Github with AI to explore.</li>

<br/>I'm exploring the possibilities of GPT-4, an AI trained on the entire internet, by attempting to get it to do programming. I'm also setting up a project with the MOZ API, and checking if anyone is around to chat. As a long-time user of vim, NeoVim, and vi, I'm sharing my knowledge of their efficiency and keystroke commands with any potential readers. I'm also providing a link to the MOZ Links API Documentation, so read on.</li>

<br/>I'm experimenting with NeoVim, a vim-compatible fork, to live-stream in my journal. I'm also exploring the Meissner and Schwinger effects to create more thrust. To achieve my goals, I'm using Linux, Python, Vim, and Git. I'm creating an updated graphic of my stack to help others succeed. Join me as I dive head-first into my project tomorrow.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/qnap-hybrid-sync-backup-warnings-failed-to-copy-all-data-and-attributes/">QNAP Hybrid Sync Backup Warnings Failed to copy all data and attributes</a> (Thu Mar 30, 2023)
<br/>After experiencing a terrible headache, I decided to err on the side of caution and turn off the Copilot plugin for .txt files. I then noticed a warning that my NAS backup had failed to copy all data and attributes, and after logging in by SSH, I discovered the issue was with unsupported filenames. I resolved to fix it later - read my blog post to find out how!</li>
<li><a href="/blog/using-copilot-to-help-with-daily-journaling/">Using Copilot to Help With Daily Journaling</a> (Wed Mar 29, 2023)
<br/>I recently received a video from my boss about the potential of AIs in the future and was reminded of the opportunities and dangers that come with this technology. I decided to write in my journal about the potential of technology and my plans to stay ahead of the curve. I switched from Vim to NeoVim, enabled Copilot for markdown files, and tested out the new feature. I also discussed my plans to stream the breakthrough live on YouTube and shared my thoughts on SEO.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/marathon-live-streaming-getting-copilot-working-in-neovim/">Marathon Live Streaming Getting Copilot Working in NeoVim</a> (Tue Mar 28, 2023)
<br/>I successfully got Copilot working in NeoVim by updating the drinkme script, installing vim-plug and the Copilot plug-in from Github, and testing the authentication process. Although I'm done for the night, there are still tests and polish that need to be done. Read about my journey to get Copilot working in NeoVim on my blog.</li>
