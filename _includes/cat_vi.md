<br/>In this article, I discuss Microsoft's Embrace & Displace strategy and how it relates to Linux. I explore how this strategy can be used to benefit you, by embracing Linux and its timeless tools, and avoiding the pitfalls of planned obsolescence. Learn how to use vi, vim, NeoVim, the command-line, git, and ssh to stay competitive and never be displaced.</li>

<br/>I'm exploring the possibilities of GPT-4, an AI trained on the entire internet, by attempting to get it to do programming. I'm also setting up a project with the MOZ API, and checking if anyone is around to chat. As a long-time user of vim, NeoVim, and vi, I'm sharing my knowledge of their efficiency and keystroke commands with any potential readers. I'm also providing a link to the MOZ Links API Documentation, so read on.</li>

<br/>I asked Bing about the evolution of text editors, and they provided a timeline beginning with the 1967 development of QED and ending with Emacs and Vim's 2023 dominance. I then asked if vi was first released in 1976, and Bing confirmed. They also provided a list of 20 text editors based on vi, as well as a description of vi's influence. Bing discussed the POSIX standard and other Unix/Linux standards, and offered to answer any questions I had about them.</li>

<br/>This article reflects on my journey in life, discussing the concept of epigenetics and Mike Levin, a microbiologist who shares my name and is a hero of mine. I explore my experiences in life, including falling victim to shortcut-seekers and narcissists, and how I am learning to make sure I don't lose myself to someone else. I have embraced my environment by finding my tools, and have realized the importance of incorporating VSCode into my DNA. I discuss the power of text editors.</li>

<br/>I am a YouTuber determined to succeed without compromising my standards. I discuss the difficulty of editing videos on YouTube, how APIs can be misleading, and the power of programming languages like Python and vi. I also explore the duality of red and green energy, the strength of diversity, and the power of creativity and natural hunting skills. Finally, I share my experience of shooting my best livecast ever and how it reminded me of the resilience I have developed over the years.</li>
