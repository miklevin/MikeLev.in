I'm re-implementing my blog slice & dice system with Python, JupyterLabs 3.3.4-2, and setuptools setup.py to make a command-line interface (CLI) command. With this jigsaw puzzle approach, I'm hoping to make the most of my time and help my child.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/write-python-webcrawler-toil-talk-w-audience/">Write Python Webcrawler! Toil & Talk w/Audience</a> (Thu May 26, 2022)
<br/>As a professional programmer, I'm exploring the world of webcrawling with Python. I'll discuss how to avoid recursion and use iteration, as well as key-value data-stores, Python context managers, user agents, and the DRY principle. I'll also compare Python to other languages like RUST, and discuss the challenges of being a programmer in the digital age. Join me as I explore the world of programming and share my secret weapons as a tech Samurai!</li>
<li><a href="/blog/python-seo-step-1-persistent-dictionaries/">Python SEO Step #1: Persistent Dictionaries</a> (Wed May 25, 2022)
<br/>In this session, I will teach you how to use Python for SEO, including how to target keywords, collect data, and use machine learning algorithms. We will use JupyterLab, Python dictionaries, and a context manager to eliminate extra code. I will also discuss SqliteDict, a free and open source SQL database, as a key/value system. Learn how to use URLs as keys in key/value pair systems.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/cancelling-netflix-and-chill-t-mobile-offer/">Cancelling Netflix and Chill (T-Mobile offer)</a> (Wed May 25, 2022)
<br/>I'm cancelling my Netflix subscription and shouting out to some YouTube viewers that make streaming fun. I'm also evaluating what I should do today using three daily metaphors, considering moving back to NYC, and discussing the benefits of being anti-fragile. I'm advocating for the use of Linux, Python, Vim, and Git (LPvg) as a practical alternative to Web Development. LPvg is a great way to become a programmer without needing to learn a whole new language.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/i-don-t-want-to-blow-up/">I Don't Want To Blow Up</a> (Sun May 22, 2022)
<br/>As a tech enthusiast, I use Linux, Python, Vim and Git as my go-to tools. I'm a big fan of Bram Moolenaar's plain old Vim from 1991, as it's more future-proof and resistant to obsolescence. Are you looking to learn Vim? I'm encouraging you to do so - just type `wsl --install` in a DOS COM to get started. Vim is a powerful tool and is much more fundamental than the full web stack.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/easy-peasy-computer-literacy/">Easy Peasy Computer Literacy</a> (Fri May 20, 2022)
<br/>At 50 years old, I discovered my passion for Linux, Python, vim & git, and have been mastering it for 10 years. I use JupyterLab for learning, and am concerned about relying on vendor-driven power-tools like VSCode. To combat this, I'm following the JupyterLab contributors on Github and Twitter to ensure the Mac and Windows versions are up-to-date. Read my article to learn more about the divide between VSCode.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/righteous-feedback-loops-of-self-improvement/">Righteous Feedback Loops of Self-Improvement</a> (Fri May 13, 2022)
<br/>I start every day with a mantra of three questions and two modifiers to help condition my mind and get into the mindset of journaling. Through this daily practice, I'm learning to focus on small wins and use tools like Linux, Python, vim, and git to mechanically get tasks done. I'm also avoiding activities like video games and sports that may have long-term payoffs, and instead focusing on projects that will help me achieve small wins.</li>

<br/>As a programmer, I missed the Full Web Stack revolution based on Google V8 JavaScript extraction from Chrome known as NodeJS. I chose Python as my primary language, and while I appreciate JavaScript's loveworthy bits, I've always wondered why web browsers are so locked down to just JavaScript. Discover why this restriction forces the web to be an always JavaScript game, and the browser vendor and governance issues behind it.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/automating-meat-puppets-on-an-insanely-complex-stage/">Automating Meat Puppets On an Insanely Complex Stage</a> (Sun May 08, 2022)
<br/>I have created a system for releasing my writing to the public, using Github Pages, Python, bash scripts, and markdown. Writing takes discipline and commitment, and I have to be an objective observer, often putting myself in the mind of an opposing character - the "lizard-brain" - to gain insight. My awareness is a feedback loop, allowing me to keep a calculated version of the world in my head, like a puppet on a stage. Read my blog post to learn more about</li>

<br/>I'm 51 years old and have gained a lot of wisdom over the years. From understanding my likes and dislikes and the role of major events in my life, to recognizing the importance of financial security, I have learned a lot. I regret not taking up Python sooner, and I'm grateful for the opportunities Unix has given me. Despite the ups and downs, I wouldn't change my path and am content with how things have turned out.

<br/>As a fan of the Amiga computer, I was angry to see Apple Computers winning in the education market. Jay Miner, the creator of the Amiga, suggested a guerilla tactic to bring his computer magazines into doctors and dentists offices. Despite Apple's superior marketing, I still love the Amiga and look for its features in today's technology. I advocate for Linux, Python, vim & git, and I encourage others to explore these technologies.</li>

<br/>I recently switched from Mac to Microsoft and discovered the power of the vim command :b1. This blog post explores the importance of developing internal resilience and extracting the lessons from life experiences. I discuss the differences between the neocortex and the pituitary gland and how the neocortex can override the signals of the pituitary gland. I also share my experience of trying to get Manim to work on my Windows 11 system, and how I ultimately got it to work on Windows 10. I</li>

<br/>I'm up early, focused on operation ELTgd, and have been able to put my new blog publishing system to use. I've written scripts in Python and Bash to create directories and config files, and to commit the changes to git. I'm now editing 19 files in vim to make sure a bunch of folders exist on all 15 sites. Join me as I detail my release process and the steps I take to ensure everything runs smoothly.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/a-new-way-to-visualize-general-relativity/">A New Way To Visualize General Relativity</a> (Wed May 04, 2022)
<br/>Today was a big day for me - I installed Manim on my Windows machine, used Chocolatey to install vim, and Powershell to create .py files. To top it off, I sent a video that visualizes general relativity. I'm really enjoying exploring the Python Manim math visualization and animation package and all the possibilities it offers. Come join me on my journey and explore the wonders of Python Manim!</li>

<br/>I have developed a system using Jekyll and Liquid template language to templatize the Google Analytics MEASUREMENT ID for my websites. To keep track of them, I wrote Python scripts to parse through the lines in sites.txt and create a `_config.yml` file for each website. With this system, I have a master list of my sites and a quick way to update the information.</li>

<br/>I recently moved my Wordpress site off of my HostMonster account and exported the content as markdown. To re-publish the content, I used Github Pages and managed the blog content across 15 sites with a single journal.md file and a bash file. To make the process easier, I wrote a Python script, make_helpers, to manage the sites.txt file and change the order of the file locations. Read my blog post to find out how I did it.</li>

<br/>I recently completed a 15-year project, blogslicer, as part of my ELPGD (every little project gets done) mentality. I used Linux, Python, vim, and git to create the program, and now I'm incorporating a feature to remove stopwords from Jekyll blog URLs using the Python library, nltk. I'm writing code to create a blog post with a given title, slug, and path, which will generate a journal.md file with a table</li>

<br/>Growing up with people who meant me harm, I didn't realize it until much later. I eventually saw my Uncle Bob as a war-era pilot and a slumlord, and I decided to take control of my life. I moved to New York City with my then-spouse, only to face a costly eviction and a failed marriage. I soon realized that everything in life is strategy and war, and I had to take over my dad's check cashing business and rescue my mom from</li>

<br/>I'm learning to express myself fluently in English, use Linux, Python, vim, and git, and focus on joy-filled habits. I'm also recognizing the importance of maintenance and organization to achieve flow, but understand the difficulty of developing habits in a constantly changing environment. I'm exploring the luxuries of static environments, like properties and inheritances, and how they can help with habit formation.</li>
