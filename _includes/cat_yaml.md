<br/>Clean up your drafts folder and start using `_drafts` for actual drafts! Learn how to set the publish field to false in Jekyll Front Matter, adjust list comprehension to filter out unpublished posts, and preserve fields during the YAML-chopping step. Improve the core yamlchop function with a before and after example and see the result with the first release under the new code.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/why-markdown-why-yaml-why-they-re-great-together/">Why Markdown? Why YAML? Why They're Great Together!</a> (Thu May 04, 2023)
<br/>In this article, I discuss why I chose to use Markdown and YAML together for my 1-textfile-for-life system. I explain why Markdown is popular and why YAML is a great serialization format that is human-readable. I also discuss the benefits of using a static site generator like Jekyll and how YAMLchop can help with creating a 1000-page site from 1 file. Finally, I explore how to render the markdown.</li>

<br/>I'm a 52-year-old technology generalist who has been exploring the noosphere, the world of ideas and creativity. I've been building up my internal tools, such as Linux, Python, vim and git, to create potential. I'm now combining YAML and Markdown to create a 1-text-file journaling system that is more flexible and intuitive than other solutions. I'm exploring the power of text, and how it can be transformed and used to create something meaningful.</li>

<br/>Test out my new auto-publish prevention system when AI has written fields. I'm doing one release before giving this a title as a control, and making sure the system works. This is a small article release, and I may delete it.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/moved-1-long-page-version-of-journal-md-to-drafts/">Moved 1-long-page version of journal.md to `_drafts`</a> (Sat Apr 29, 2023)
<br/>I have moved the 1-long-page version of my journal.md file to the `_drafts` folder, allowing me to keep posts unpublished without giving them a yaml title. This is a great way to keep posts out of Github publishing space, while still allowing them to be sliced & diced.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/gathering-all-category-logic-into-one-place/">Gathering All Category Logic into One Place</a> (Mon Apr 24, 2023)
<br/>I'm using AI, Linux, Python, vim & git to create a journal with entries written by me. I'm optimizing for search engines and testing Copilot to process my thoughts. I'm also writing code to create a description of the OpenAI category and using nltk and collections libraries to find the most common categories. I'm sharing my thoughts and experiences in this journal and making it available to the public.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/designing-yamlesque-post-generator-api/">Designing YAMLesque Post Generator API</a> (Sat Apr 22, 2023)
<br/>I'm amazed by how things just work. I'm using 80-hyphens as a parser token to make my front-matter handling more slicey and yaml-like. I've written a powerful function called chop_chop that takes a file path and returns a tuple with 3 positions. Occasionally I'll do one-off's in Jupyter Notebooks. I'm excited to see the results of my work and hope you will be too.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/admiring-the-usefulness-of-yaml-ness-in-my-journaling-system/">Admiring the Usefulness of YAML-ness in my Journaling System</a> (Sat Apr 22, 2023)
<br/>I'm reveling in the glory of my code working as it should. I'm using YAML-ness to create a journaling system with a dictionary of lower-case usage as keys and all the happenstance uses as lists in each value. I wrote a program to parse a journal file and extracted the front matter of each post, then loaded it into a YAML dictionary. I'm now ready to give this a title and share my journey of slicing up my life into chunks.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/openai-category-pages-nearly-done/">OpenAI Category Pages Nearly Done</a> (Fri Apr 21, 2023)
<br/>I'm nearly finished creating category pages for my website using Jekyll's YAML-like front matter, and I'm using a Python-based YAML validator to make sure I don't make any mistakes. I'm also lemmatizing keyword groups and picking categories from a top-N list to limit the number of categories. I just need to make the category pages look better, have the correct titles and descriptions, and use the most common proper case.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/yaml-validation-now-baked-into-yamlesque-journaling-system/">YAML-validation Now Baked Into YAMLesque Journaling System</a> (Fri Apr 21, 2023)
<br/>I'm a big fan of the Google App and seeing AI appear there via Google Discover. I'm enjoying watching Microsoft embracing and displacing Google with AI. I suggest people make automations they want to rule them. I wrote a poem about a fictional AI named Yahwanna. I'm also using AI ChatBots, OpenAI's GPT products, API-request, SQLite database, YAML, Mermaid diagram, and a local SQLite key-value store. And more if you can believe it!</li>
<li><a href="/blog/fixing-how-openai-couldn-t-format-keywords-consistently/">Fixing How OpenAI Couldn't Format Keywords Consistently</a> (Mon Apr 17, 2023)
<br/>I'm working to fix OpenAI keyword problems by writing code to recognize text that doesn't match the keyword format, handling commas inside quotes, and creating histograms. I've used this code to re-write the database of keywords for my blog, validate YAML in Python without Jekyll, and create category pages and navigation. I'm committed to developing a code that can consistently format keywords.</li>
