title: Pipulate Free and Open Source AI SEO Software
description: Pipulate is a free and open source SEO software project that uses AI to automate SEO tasks. It runs locally on your machine so you can cycle IPs and automate web browsers without getting blocked or paying for a service. The rub is you're going to have to allow a normalized Linux server to run on your Windows or Mac laptop, and maybe have to learn something. Sorry.

The best techniques in SEO involve running Python locally to do lightweight
crawls and keyword investigations. Not everything is a large framework or a new
$X-dollars-a-month service. Sometimes it's just learning enough Python basics
to do small investigations with the power-tools built into Python ***for
free*** plus a little guidance. That's Pipulate.
