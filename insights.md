## Google Search Console 404s - Thu Apr 24

Do you ever notice that some of your 404s go away in Google Search Console (GS)
over time, but not all of them? Persistent 404 errors in Google Search Console
probably means persistent interest in the topic, and you should either consider
bringing back the original content that was there (reworking for whatever reason
it was removed), or a better 301 redirect to take advantage of that potential
traffic asset. Google is saying it *wants* to show your site on the topics
related to that page. It's not giving up on you. Tackling these will be one of
the things to do when home-hosting.

## Collapse All Folders In VSCode - Thu Apr 24

I'm on VSCode and its forks. I don't wanna be. I'm a vim sort of person. I'm
only even on NeoVim because I want an `init.lua` for better AI macro support,
instead of `.vimrc` where all those control characters are so hard to type and
copy/paste. And all the best AI help is in VSCode and its forks like Cursor. But
now that I am on VSCode/Cursor, I need to get over the biggest friction points.
And that is directory-diving. Those nested directory panels are the productivity
killers. I just found the inconspicuous "Collapse Folders in Explorer" link.
Collapse them all â€” ALL THE TIME, then expand as necessary.
