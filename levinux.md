description: Levinux is a tiny virtual Linux server built on Tiny Core Linux and QEMU designed to give you a first (sometimes positive) experience with logging into text-based Terminal environments, the ssh command, and the vi editor.

# Tiny Virtual Linux for Education

Levinux is a micro Linux distribution that runs from USB or Dropbox with a
double-click on Macs, Windows or Linux PCs. It does not require any
installation or admin rights. It is designed for education and learning
purposes, especially for Unix-like systems. It is based on Tiny Core Linux and
QEMU, and it provides a minimal and portable virtual Linux server. It also
includes tools such as Vim and Git for coding and version control.

Created in 2010 and still going strong, Levinux is a low-investment way of
getting a wee bit familiar with Linux and Unix-like environments. Why would
anyone want to do this? In a sea of change, there are very few lighthouses of
stability in tech. Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg) are among the very few
things you can learn today that will serve you for the rest of your life. The
are the great timeless tools of tech.
