# Mike Levin's Poetry

## The Poetry of Mike Levin

Once upon a time, I wrote a lot of poetry. I was a young hotshot webmaster, and
I was full of myself. I was also full of angst. I was also full of ideas. I was
also full of energy. I was also full of passion. I was also full of poetry.
This is it, from a Commodore Wonderland to MOZ.

- [Who Let in The Bees?](/poetry/bees/) — we see how mediocrity eternally recurs.
- [The Eighty Twenty Rule](/poetry/eighty-twenty-rule/) — we organize our efforts for maximum returns.
- [The Lizard Tail Task](/poetry/lizard-tail/) — bozo bosses get replaced by more bozo bosses.
- [Dueling a Mule](/poetry/dueling-mule/) — I first take aim on sysadmins from hell.
- [Occam's Razor](/poetry/occams-razor/) — I remind myself of the best way to tackle problems.
- [The Success Poem](/poetry/success-poem/) — I realize losing sleep while young is part of success.
- [The Ghost Ball](/poetry/ghost-ball/) — I notice some underlying rules of predicting outcomes.
- [Lion on The Savannah](/poetry/lion-savannah/) — I remind myself how foolish it is to lose focus.
- [The Llama an Yak](/poetry/llama-and-yak/) — a misguided sysadmin from hell is put in his place.
- [Golden Goose](/poetry/golden-goose/) — we see how clueless short-sighted bosses drive out talent.
- [Satan's Son](/poetry/satans-son/) — we see a young hotshot take on a tough old seasoned guy.
