# Mike Levin, SEO in NYC Blog

## Welcome to my Daily Work Journal

> I'm Mike Levin, an SEO in NYC, and this is my daily work journal. It's all
> built from a 1-text-file for life approach.

I'm a tech who's been around the block a few times, in the field of SEO and all
things Linux, Python, vim & git. My topics range wildly from a digital nomadic
lifestyle that lets you reproduce the timeless writing, blogging and coding
environment I use (and have "canned" for you), to the latest in AI, machine
learning, and the future of work.
