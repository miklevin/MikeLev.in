You Jesus? No, Osmosis... haha, credit my HS science teacher, Frank Milauskas.
He had the same look. No, just a dirty hippy who's been around the block a few
times. I'm a 50-year-old SEO in NYC, and this is my daily work journal. It's
all built from a 1-text-file for life approach. Oh, I also was apparently who
my employers tagged with AI / Alien disclosure, but who knows. They've got
Amazing Stories in their blood, so it's probably all just a story.
