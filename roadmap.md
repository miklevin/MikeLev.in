# Roadmap for https://MikeLev.in/

Welcome to the roadmap for [mikelev.in](https://mikelev.in/), where I outline the future direction of this site and its content. As a Technical SEO expert with a passion for future-proofing tech skills, I’m committed to evolving this site into a valuable resource for developers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone looking to stay ahead in the digital landscape. This roadmap reflects my philosophy of continuous improvement, leveraging timeless tools like the LPvg stack and AI to create a site that’s not just informative but also practical and engaging.

This is a living document, and I’ll update it as the site grows. Here’s what’s planned:

---

## Content Strategy

- **Extract and Refine Topics**:  
  Use AI tools like Ollama to analyze my existing blog posts, identify buried topics, and refine them into stand-alone articles. This will surface valuable insights from my stream-of-consciousness writing and make them more accessible to readers.  
  *Priority: High* | *Timeline: Q4 2024*

- **Create a "Start Here" Page**:  
  Build a welcoming page for new visitors, introducing the LPvg stack, my projects (like Pipulate and Chip O'Theseus), and the site’s core philosophy. This will act as a guide to help readers navigate and understand the site’s purpose.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Q1 2025*

- **LPvg Tutorials**:  
  Develop a series of tutorials or guides on mastering the LPvg stack, featuring practical examples and real-world applications. These will cater to beginners and advanced users alike, reinforcing the value of these timeless tools.  
  *Priority: High* | *Timeline: Q4 2024 – Q2 2025*

- **AI Integration Case Studies**:  
  Publish detailed case studies on how I use AI in my development workflow, covering successes, challenges, and lessons learned. This will offer actionable insights for readers interested in integrating AI into their own projects.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Q1 2025*

## Site Structure and Navigation

- **Implement Search**:  
  Add the AI-enhanced search tool I’ve developed, enabling visitors to easily find content. This will be a client-side solution to maintain the static nature of the site, using AI-generated summaries and keywords for better accuracy.  
  *Priority: High* | *Timeline: Q4 2024*

- **Categorize Content**:  
  Organize blog posts into clear categories like LPvg, AI Integration, Technical SEO, and Projects. This will improve navigation and help readers quickly find topics that interest them.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Q1 2025*

- **Tag System**:  
  Add tags to each post and create a tag filter system, allowing readers to explore content by topic. This will enhance discoverability and make the site more user-friendly.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Q1 2025*

## Technical Enhancements

- **Integrate AI Tools**:  
  Embed my AI-powered topic mining script into the site’s workflow to automatically identify and extract valuable topics from new posts. This will streamline content creation and ensure no insights are missed.  
  *Priority: High* | *Timeline: Q4 2024*

- **Explore Server-Side Features**:  
  Investigate switching to a hosting solution that supports server-side features, such as dynamic comments or a forum. This would enable richer interactivity while maintaining the site’s core simplicity.  
  *Priority: Low* | *Timeline: Q2 2025*

- **SEO Optimization**:  
  Leverage my SEO expertise to optimize the site for search engines, using structured data, meta tags, and internal linking. This will ensure the content reaches a broader audience and ranks well.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Ongoing*

---

## Community and Engagement

- **Enable Comments**:  
  Add a commenting system so readers can share thoughts, ask questions, and discuss topics like the LPvg stack, AI, and SEO. This will foster a sense of community around the site.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Q1 2025*

- **Start a Newsletter**:  
  Launch a newsletter to share updates on new content, project progress, and exclusive insights. This will build a loyal readership and keep the audience engaged.  
  *Priority: Low* | *Timeline: Q2 2025*

- **Highlight Contributions**:  
  Showcase community contributions to projects like Pipulate, recognizing contributors and encouraging collaboration. This will strengthen the community and inspire participation.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Q1 2025*

## Project Development

- **Evolve Pipulate**:  
  Continue advancing Pipulate, my free, open-source SEO tool, with regular updates and a beta release for early adopters. Future enhancements will include more AI features and a polished user experience.  
  *Priority: High* | *Timeline: Ongoing*

- **Document Chip O'Theseus**:  
  Chronicle the development of Chip O'Theseus, my local AI project, emphasizing its applications and privacy-focused philosophy. This will offer a deep dive into building AI tools that align with the LPvg ethos.  
  *Priority: Medium* | *Timeline: Q1 2025*

- **Explore New Projects**:  
  Investigate new tools or projects that fit the LPvg philosophy, such as a local-first AI assistant or a NixOS configuration utility. These will keep the site innovative and forward-thinking.  
  *Priority: Low* | *Timeline: Q2 2025*
