# Finding Purpose Through Timeless Tech Skills

**LPvgn** is a time-tested tech stack that gives you superpowers. It's five simple tools that work together: Linux, Python, vim, git & nix. I use them daily to build AI and automation systems — but they're perfect for any technical challenge. Master these fundamentals, and you'll have a career foundation that lasts. Levinux and Pipulate are the two main projects I've spun out of it over the years. Whoops! You fell into a rabbit hole!

## Future-proof Yourself In The Age of AI!

Here's a giant list of links to my stream-of-consciousness tech blog! Don't
worry, I'm organizing it with AI, labeling, refnining, and all that happy
horseshit — making it searchable and giving it a wonderful drill-down hierarchy
for LLM-assisted small-world-theory web crawls, making a wonderful user
experience. Find all that stuff you're going to have to know or fall behind —
with a half-century perspective that's not just following the flocking herd. You
found it early, so feel free to wade through the raw mess and experience it
coming alive beneath you.

> If you're ramblin and a rollin down the road out in the stix  
> And then suddenly you realize that you're on route 66  
> And the topics that you cover interest everyone alive  
> Then perhaps you need more traffic like you're on I-95!
