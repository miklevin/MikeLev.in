I fell in love with the Amiga Computer over 30 years ago, and have been trying
to recapture the magic ever since. I've tried everything, and after much pain
and deliberation have come to the conclusion that you should not fall in love
with your hardware. Software on the other hand can stay with you for life and
never lets you down &#151; so long as it's well-chosen FOSS (free and open
source software). The learning curve can be steep, but it's worth it.

I'm talking about craftsmanship in tech. Digital artistry. Make it impossible
for anyone to take your hard-won muscle memory away from you with the next
upgrade, license change, job switch and everything else keeping you on the
hamster wheel of tech. Think VSCode's going to be with you for life? Think
again. But what's it all emulating? What do they all go to great lengths to be
like? Linux and vim. It's a hard pill to swallow, but there it is.
