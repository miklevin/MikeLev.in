Tech skills are often rendered obsolete through changes in platforms and tools
by design. Future-proof yourself by jumping on the Linux, Python, vim & git
platform (LPvg) &#151; while staying on Windows! This is possible by using the
MyKoz.AI script which installs JupyterLab on your machine so that the Notebooks
are served from Linux. You won't find this anywhere else. Added bonus: get up
and running journalling daily on the eternal vim text editor.
