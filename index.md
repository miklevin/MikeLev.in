Tech skills are often rendered obsolete through changes in platforms and tools.
That's by design. Future-proof yourself by jumping on the Linux, Python, vim &
git platform (LPvg). This is easier than you think merely by taking up Python
through Jupyter Notebooks as many do. But instead of using cloud-based Google
Colab or other similar vendor-dependency inducing routes, you install
JupyterLab on your local Windows machine, but actually on Linux. Your Python
code is then ***Linux flavored*** and sets the stage to bridge the world
between Computer Science and WebDev/DevOps (24x7 automation).
