# What's A-I-S-E-O?

## Old Mike Levin Spins a Yarn, A-I-S-E-O!

Hello World! I'm an old SciFi reader and Mac & Windows fanboy who today writes
***with*** and ***for*** AI. I'm loving us lapping the SciFi predictions of
Clarke and Asimov, adjusting to the new reality as we do. I started out at
Commodore in the 80's. My skills have gone through many leading-edge
obsolescence cycles until I couldn't stand it anymore. With much seeking and
testing, I found my way to Linux, Python, vim & git (***LPvg***) as a timeless
core, and I've been making it my mission to help others hop on that train as
easily as possible. And it's not just about the tools. It's about the
***mindset***.

No matter how things change in tech, ***LPvg*** will always be there, and being
adept at them will always make you valuable. There is a fallacy that becoming
adept at Linux means adopting a Linux desktop. That's not true. You can use
Linux from Windows or Mac, and I'll show you how. Stay on the desktop you love,
and use Linux as a subsystem that you can grow into, and which will follow you
throughout your career. You can get better at it for life, the way musicians,
athletes and artists do with their craft. Tech ***can*** be like that, but you
need to be careful about what you invest in. ***LPvg*** is a safe bet.

### MyKoz: A Real OS on Windows (Linux) teaching Tow-it-izm

This is a little endeavor of mine that goes back more than ten years. It
started out as Levinux, but since Microsoft added the Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL), that has become the obvious way to keep your skills sharp and
timeless. I mean think about Microsoft adding Linux to Windows as a standard
feature. If you don't think that's a big deal, you're not paying attention.
Linux won. And it's not about desktop's. It's about AI, the cloud, and the
Internet of Things (IoT). Linux is the core of all that. You can start easing
yourself onto the parts of Linux that matter most, and you can do it from
Windows. I'll show you how.

Highlight this text, and copy it to your clipboard. Then create a file called
`drinkme.bat` on your desktop, save it, and double-click it. It will download
the latest version of MyKoz, replacing the default Windows Ubuntu 22.04 with
one that will host JupyterLab on `localhost:8888` using the Linux version of
Python running on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It will also install a
few Github repositories to get you started with Free and Open Source SEO
software, if that is of any interest to you. If not, it is a lesson in generic
data collection and analysis, which is the core of AI and many other things.

```bash
@echo off
setlocal enableDelayedExpansion
set "TIME=%TIME::=%"
set "TIME=%TIME:.=%"
set /a "T=!TIME!"
set "URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miklevin/drinkme/main/install.bat?cache=!T!"
set "FILENAME=install.bat"
curl -s -o "%FILENAME%" "%URL%" ^
