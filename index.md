# What's A-I-S-E-O?

## Old Mike Levin Spins a Yarn, A-I-S-E-O!

Hello World! I'm an old SciFi reader and Mac & Windows fanboy who today writes
***with***&#151;but more importantly ***for*** AI. I started out at Commodore
Computers in the 80's. My skills have gone through the cutting-edge
obsolescence cycle until I couldn't stand it anymore. I gradually found my way
to Linux, Python, vim & git as a timeless core. 

No matter how things change in tech, LPvg will always be there, and being adept
at them will always make you valuable. But making the transition can be tough.
To make it easier, I made a version of JupyterLab that will run on Windows or
Macs from the Linux subsystem. This is a big deal because the "flavor" of
Python you'll get used to is the same as the ***cloud*** version.
