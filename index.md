Psst! You want tech skills that will apply to everything and last you for life
with a minimum of the retraining rigmarole inflicted upon you by planned
obsolescence? Well, you've heard of Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism? I'm here to
teach you Tow-it-ism with MyKoz: AReal/OS - a way of using a Linux Subsystem on
Windows for a minimalistic and portable approach to computing. See, you
***tow*** the tech that never goes obsolete around with you for life. It's the
tiny tech stack of ***Linux, Python, vim & git.***

## Linux, Pyton, vim & git

***MyKoz: A Real OS*** (pronounced like Marcus Aurelius) is a modification of
the standard Windows Ubuntu Linux under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
designed to teach you stoicism and the timeless skills of Linux, Python, vim
and git. You get a JupyterLab server running with a few Github repositories
pre-installed to get you started with ***Free and Open Source SEO software***.
If you're not into SEO, it's a great way to learn generic data collection and
analysis, which is the core of AI and more.

## It's Not Easy Being Green

Oh wait, I've heard of Mike Levin. You're that Marine Biologist? No, I am
***not*** the epigeneticist, though I think he's awesome. I'm the SEO guy.

## Ease Yourself Into Linux

You've heard of Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism? This is MyKoz: AReal/OS and
Tow-it-ism; a way of using a Linux Subsystem on Windows for a minimalistic and
portable approach to computing.

### MyKoz: A Real OS... on Windows. Learn Tow-it-izm

MyKoz: A Real OS (pronounced like Marcus Aurelius) is a modification of the
standard Windows Ubuntu Linux under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
designed to teach you stoicism and the timeless skills of Linux, Python, vim
and git. Upon install, you'll get a JupyterLab server running on localhost:8888
with a few Github repositories pre-installed to get you started with Free and
Open Source SEO software. If you're not into SEO, it's a great way to learn
generic data collection and analysis, which is the core of AI and more.

Copy the text below to your clipboard. Then create a file called `drinkme.bat`
on your Windows 10 or 11 desktop, save it, and double-click it. It will
download the latest version of MyKoz, replacing the default Windows Ubuntu
22.04 with one that will host JupyterLab on `localhost:8888` using the Linux
version of Python running on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It will
also install a few Github repositories to get you started with Free and Open
Source SEO software, if that is of any interest to you. If not, it is a lesson
in generic data collection and analysis, which is the core of AI and many other
things.
