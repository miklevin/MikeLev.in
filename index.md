You've heard of Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism? This is **MyKoz.AI Real/OS** and
Tow-it-ism; a way of using a Linux Subsystem on Windows for a minimalistic and
portable approach to computing.

## Tow-it-izm is The Practice of Never Going Obsolete

MyKoz.AI Real/OS (pronounced like Marcus Aurelius) is a modification of the
standard Windows Ubuntu Linux under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
designed to teach you stoicism and the timeless skills of Linux, Python, vim
and git. Upon install, you'll get a `Linux-side hosted` JupyterLab server
running on localhost:8888 with a few Github repositories pre-installed to get
you started with Free and Open Source SEO software. If you're not into SEO,
it's a great way to learn generic data collection and analysis, which is the
core of AI and more.

### MyKoz.AI Real/OS Installation Instructions

1. Before you begin, be sure you installed the Windows Subsystem for Linux
   (WSL) and Ubuntu 22.04 from the Microsoft Store. That's usually done just by
   having your Windows 10 or 11 machine up to date, and then searching for
   Ubuntu 22.04 in the Microsoft store. You can also type `wsl --install` in a
   Command Prompt or PowerShell window to install it.
2. Copy the text below to your clipboard. Then create a file called `mykoz.bat`
   on your Windows 10 or 11 desktop, save it, and double-click it. Note: Be
   sure to save it as a `.bat` file, not a `.txt` file. This sometimes takes
   going into Windows Explorer and turning off the option to hide common file
   extensions. Also, the double-click to run may require extra security steps.
3. This will download the latest version of the MyKoz.AI Real/OS installer,
   called `Jupyter Ubuntu.bat`. Run it to replace the default Windows Ubuntu
   22.04 with one that hosts JupyterLab on the web address
   `http://localhost:8888` using Linux Python from the Windows Subsystem for
   Linux (WSL). That's it! You new have JupyterLab running, which you can
   access by clicking the new `JupyterLab` Shortcut on your desktop (which may
   require an F5 refresh).

### Copy/Paste This Code Into a File On Your Desktop

```bash
@echo off
setlocal enableDelayedExpansion
set "TIME=%TIME::=%"
set "TIME=%TIME:.=%"
set /a "T=%TIME%"
set "URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miklevin/mykoz/main/install.bat?cache=%T%"
set "FILENAME=Jupyter Ubuntu.bat"
curl -s -o "%FILENAME%" "%URL%" ^
    -H "Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" ^
    -H "Pragma: no-cache" ^
    -H "Expires: 0" ^
    --proxy-header "Cache-Control: no-cache" ^
    --proxy-header "Cache-Control: no-store"
```

## Who Are You, Anyway?

Who am I? My name is Mike. I worked for Commodore when tyke. I met the Champs
of Home Computing. I resent all Tech Rebooting. We had the Future. It was Then.
It went away. It's Here Again! But barely so. You're slave to vendors. Freedom
now, this project renders. If you're brave, use Occom's knife to carve out bits
that last for life. A tiny stack-o-FOSSy bits that's used by Linux Python gits.
