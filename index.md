# LPvg: Timeless Tech Skills for the AI Age

**[LPvg](/LPvg/)** is a completely free ***future-proofing*** minimal tech-stach ***for life*** making you a ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Don't use it for ***everything***, but know you can apply it to ***anything*** &#151; because ***all tech is text***. So edit at the speed of thought and the world is your ü¶™. Add fully reproducible üêß inside any üçé or ü™ü folder (without the üê≥) by using ‚õèÔ∏è off the ol' üíé. The tech-setup of your dreams is one üí¶ away *(if you can hydrate a DOM, you can hydrate a LAN).*

Simply upgrade from Jabberwocky to Juggernaut and no vorpal ü§∫ can stop you. This is the fully vendor-neutral ü¶¨ **FOSS**-world I'm talking about folks, where ü§ñ **AI** will only make you üí™!

## Writing as a Compass in the Tech Wilderness

I don't write üìù because I crave an audience or have products to peddle. My
words are my compass üß≠, helping me navigate the ever-shifting landscape of
technology üíª. This digital journal is my sounding board üîä, a space where ideas
echo üîâ and crystallize üíé. With each post, I'm forging a path forward üõ§Ô∏è,
articulating the complex, and holding myself accountable to the journey I've
chosen&#151;and practicing my craft üõ†.
