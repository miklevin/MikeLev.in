# Mike Levin, SEO in NYC Blog

## Welcome to my Daily Work Journal

This is my 1-long text-file for life journaling. I write in NeoVim, Copilot
assisted lately, and me one of first AI-assisted life journalers. I'm a
52-year-old SEO in NYC who codes and distributes free and open source SEO
software on a small Linux distro. Levinux is a tiny Linux VM toy. Pipulate is a
FOSS SEO software. And YAMLchop is how I'm slicing a 1-textfile journal up into
this site.
