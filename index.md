- **`Linux`**: The open-source pulse of global computation.
- **`Python`**: Language of logic, creativity, and discovery.
- **`vim`**: The text whisperer—efficiency bound in keystrokes.
- **`git`**: The memory keeper—track, share, and never lose your way.
- **`nix/NixOS`**: Reproducibility redefined—consistency across the code cosmos.
- **`tmux`**: Command-line conjurer—sessions split, disconnected, and reborn.
- **`Jupyter Notebooks`**: Code meets canvas—prototype, iterate, illuminate.
- **`FastHTML`**: From Python thoughts to web realities in a heartbeat.
- **`Ollama`**: Offline AI, always listening—your local companion in thought.

This is the story of connecting fragmented tools and concepts into a cohesive
development workflow—building a portable, reproducible environment that’s ready
to spin up at any moment, anywhere. From mastering Linux, Python, Vim, and Git
to leveraging Nix Flakes and Infrastructure as Code, each step has refined the
process of creating a versatile toolkit for the AI age. Navigating NixOS’s
declarative configurations and Python’s dynamic flexibility, I’ve crafted a
cross-platform setup that integrates JupyterLab, CUDA, FastHTML, and local LLMs
like Ollama. This foundation isn’t just about technology, but about reclaiming
agency in development, offering a consistent starting point for any project in
any industry, while avoiding the pitfalls of over-engineering. The result is a
streamlined approach that balances practicality and reusability, making it
easier to focus on solving problems and creating new solutions without getting
lost in architectural abstraction.
