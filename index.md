Future-proof yourself by jumping on the Linux, Python, vim & git bandwagon
(LPvg) &#151; even while staying on Windows! Tech skills go obsolete by design
to keep you spending and retraining. Freedom can start by running ***Linux
flavored Python*** on your ***local machine***, opening a door that normally
remains shut in most people's lives until it's too late. Helping you do thiat
