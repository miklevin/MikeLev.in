## LPvg Stack (Linux, Python, vim & git)

<ul class="lpvg-list">
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">`Linux`</code>: The universal foundation that runs beneath it all</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">`Python`</code>: The elegant language that automates the tedious</li>

  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">`git`</code>: Version control that makes your work immortal</li>
</ul>

**[LPvg](/LPvg/)** is a time-tested tech stack that gives you superpowers. It's four simple tools that work together: Linux, Python, vim and git. I use them daily to build AI and automation systems, but they're perfect for any technical challenge. Master these fundamentals, and you'll have a career foundation that lasts.

## Tech Journal & AI Experiment 

I'm building something exciting: an open-source tool called Pipulate that combines these classic tools with modern AI. It's a simple Python framework that harnesses AI's power while staying lightweight and hackable.

This site documents the journey. Each post explores the intersection of timeless tech skills and emerging AI capabilities. I'm creating a living knowledge base that grows smarter over time &#151; and sharing everything I learn along the way. Join me in building a more sustainable approach to technology.
