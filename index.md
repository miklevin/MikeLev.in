# LPvg Stack: Timeless Tech Skills for the AI Age

- **`Linux`**: The open-source pulse of global computation.
- **`Python`**: Language of logic, creativity, and discovery.
- **`vim`**: The text whisperer—efficiency bound in keystrokes.
- **`git`**: The memory keeper—track, share, and never lose your way.

That's the main minimal tech-stack as a sort of swiss army knife or utility belt of tech. You don't need to use it for everything, but it is applicable to everything. With a few more tools, we lower the barrier to entry and make systems reproducible across all hardware. Plus, we'll sprinkle in the free local AI and a Python-centric web development environment.

- **`nix/NixOS`**: Reproducibility redefined—consistency across the code cosmos.
- **`tmux`**: Command-line conjurer—sessions split, disconnected, and reborn.
- **`Jupyter Notebooks`**: Code meets canvas—prototype, iterate, illuminate.
- **`FastHTML`**: From Python thoughts to web realities in a heartbeat.
- **`Ollama`**: Offline AI, always listening—your local companion in thought.

## Philosophy on Staying Relevant

I believe in mastering a set of fundamental, versatile tools that I call the "LPvg stack". These form the core of what I consider a future-proof skill set. I advocate for avoiding the "hamster wheel" of constantly chasing the latest tech trends and instead focusing on timeless fundamentals that remain relevant across different eras of technology.

## Empowering Domain Experts with Tech Skills

You don't have to be a dedicated developer to benefit from these technical skills. I advocate for a different approach:

1. Become an expert in your chosen field or domain - whatever truly excites you.
2. Develop tech skills as a complementary toolset to enhance your primary expertise.

This combination allows you to:

- Maintain independence and agency in your work
- Automate tasks and improve efficiency in your domain
- Bridge the gap between your field and technology
- Adapt quickly to technological changes in your industry
- Prototype and implement ideas without always relying on dedicated developers

The goal is to empower professionals across various fields with the ability to leverage technology effectively, opening up unique opportunities at the intersection of domain expertise and tech skills.

## A Versatile and Sustainable Development Toolkit

This toolkit offers a pragmatic approach to software development, emphasizing independence, adaptability, and sustainability. By leveraging open-source and AI-enhanced components, it helps developers create portable applications that avoid vendor lock-in and complex frameworks. The result is a flexible solution that promotes consistent workflows, builds valuable muscle memory, and ensures applications remain relevant as technology evolves. Focusing on open standards and portability serves as a form of future-proofing, allowing for scalability without sacrificing autonomy.

## A Cohesive, Cross-Platform Foundation for Agency

This approach showcases the connection of fragmented tools and concepts into a cohesive development workflow. By mastering Linux, Python, Vim, and Git, and leveraging technologies like NixOS, Nix Flakes, JupyterLab, CUDA, FastHTML, and local LLMs, developers can create a portable, reproducible environment ready to spin up at any moment, anywhere. This foundation prioritizes agency in development, offering a consistent starting point for any project while avoiding over-engineering. The result is a streamlined approach that balances practicality and reusability, making it easier to focus on solving problems and creating new solutions without getting lost in architectural abstraction.
