## Future-proofing w/ Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg)

AI makes it feel like we're facing unprecedented change, but we've lived through
the industrial, atomic, and information ages. Humanity adapts. It's not the
first time we've had to change the way we live and work. Join me as I, a
50-something, musters enough neuroplasticity to adapt and thrive while avoiding
the hamster wheel of tech, and mastering a small set of versatile, timeless
tools. On this site, I focus on:

- **Linux, Python, vim & git**: Mastering the future-proof LPvg minimum subplatform
- **Re-acquiring Math Skills**: Picking up where my 1970s K-12 education left off
- **Staying at the Top of My Field**: Protecting my earning capacity as things change
- **The minimal tool-chain for AI**: Expanding LPvg to include vector databases, etc.

## The Persistence of Text Files and Code

It's all about text files and pushing bits around. Even after the rise of AI,
this fundamental concept will persist. User interfaces may change, and barriers
for entry will lower for non-programmers, but interacting with AIs won't absolve
you from learning to code. It just makes initial sketching easier. However,
complex problems remain complex.

While Jensen Huang says you won't have to learn to code and calls Python weird,
he admits that the first time you talk to AI will be in English, but the second
time it can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NSBdLouwEDM">give you the
Python code</a>. See the contradiction? You won't need to learn coding unless
you want to do second-pass refinements. English isn't reliable enough to build
automated systems around, and Python has become the lingua franca of tech.

## The Hamster Wheel of Faddish Tech

Tech fads reset every 5 to 10 years. If you're on that hamster wheel, such as
with modern JavaScript frameworks, you go from Angular to React to Vue to
Svelte, constantly relearning, retraining, and either migrating or abandoning
old code bases. Generally, the concept of a "framework" is to blame. But Python
hit a fundamental level and IS the framework. Even when you use a framework on
top of Python, such as Flask, FastAPI, or FastHTML, switching is much easier.
Python interfaces remain remarkably stable over the years, allowing your
intuition and muscle memory to improve.

The new breed of AI text-editors emphasizes this point. Your text editor is
where you spend a significant amount of time, especially if you use it for
general writing and prompt engineering in addition to coding. It's as essential
as your bed or chair, but even more so because it becomes ingrained in your
fingers through muscle memory and shortcuts. Switching text editors can be more
disruptive than switching programming languages, and forced abandonment occurs
as they come and go. Think VSCode is here forever? It's already under attack
from Cursor, and more alternatives will emerge.

## Future-Proofing with LPvg Skills

If you develop muscle memory from years of practice in this slightly
lower-than-usual level of tech mastery, you won't become obsolete. LPvg skills
may not be as trendy or seemingly valuable as the current fad, but they will
keep your skills relevant and provide an alternative to popular approaches,
offering some freedom from vendor lock-in.

No matter how jazzed up or convenient power-tools become, you'll notice an
underlying system of Linux, Python, vim, and git that even they rely on.

## Lessons from the Amiga: Loving the Abstractions

It's not always smooth sailing. The carpet can be pulled out from under you, no
matter how well you prepare. The idea is to make smart choices, so a good deal
of what you know and your hard-won muscle memory and habits remain applicable.

I fell in love with the Amiga Computer some 30 years ago and have been trying to
recapture that magic ever since. I've concluded that you shouldn't fall in love
with your hardware or the particulars of your system. Instead, if you can love
some of the higher-level abstractions that cut across time, space, and problem
domains, you'll be okay.
