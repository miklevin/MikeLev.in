# Mike Levin, SEO in NYC Blog

## Welcome to my Daily Work Journal

<img alt="ASCII Alice Down the Rabbit Hole" src="/assets/images/ascii-alice-down-the-rabbit-hole-green.png" width="180vw" style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">
This is my 1-long text-file for life journaling. I write in NeoVim, Copilot
assisted lately, and me one of first AI-assisted life journalers. I'm a
52-year-old SEO in NYC who codes and distributes free and open source SEO
software on a small Linux distro. Levinux is a tiny Linux VM toy. Pipulate is a
FOSS SEO software. And YAMLchop is how I'm slicing a 1-textfile journal up into
this site.

### An Ode to The Status Quo

> I will not get discovered  
> And it's not to be lamented;  
> Just practice what you preach   
> Just like how Python is indented.   
>   
> They will not like your reasons  
> Because notions will deface  
> The clutterduck appearance  
> They all love of curly brace.  
>   
> Dig in, do your duty—  
> Just keep doling out dem clues  
> In content they'll ignore  
> But their competitor imbues.   
>   
> Lather, rinse, repeat;  
> With writing, blatantly get gall in,  
> So when you're on a roll there is  
> Some chance it starts snowballing.  
>   
> But it won't so do not sweat it,  
> Find a wave and merely surf it.  
> It'll kill ya if you let it—  
> Don't forget all paths are worth it!  
>   
> I'll enumerate the faux pas  
> Making so much effort fizzle  
> Shedding light on popcultfallacy:  
> It's not steak if there's no sizzle.
