# What's A-I-S-E-O?

## Old Mike Levin Spins a Yarn, A-I-S-E-O!

Hello World! I'm an old SciFi reader and Mac & Windows fanboy who today writes
***with*** and ***for*** AI. I'm loving us lapping the SciFi predictions of
Clarke and Asimov, adjusting to the new reality as we do. I started out at
Commodore in the 80's. My skills have gone through many leading-edge
obsolescence cycles until I couldn't stand it anymore. With much seeking and
testing, I found my way to Linux, Python, vim & git (***LPvg***) as a timeless
core, and I've been making it my mission to help others hop on that train as
easily as possible. And it's not just about the tools. It's about the
***mindset***.

No matter how things change in tech, ***LPvg*** will always be there, and being
adept at them will always make you valuable. There is a fallacy that becoming
adept at Linux means adopting a Linux desktop. That's not true. You can use
Linux from Windows or Mac, and I'll show you how. Stay on the desktop you love,
and use Linux as a subsystem that you can grow into, and which will follow you
throughout your career. You can get better at it for life, the way musicians,
athletes and artists do with their craft. Tech ***can*** be like that, but you
need to be careful about what you invest in. ***LPvg*** is a safe bet.
