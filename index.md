I fell in love with the Amiga Computer over 30 years ago, and have been trying
to recapture the magic ever since. I've tried everything, and after much pain
and deliberation have come to the conclusion that you should not fall in love
with your hardware. Software on the other hand can stay with you for life and
never lets you down &#151; so long as it's well-chosen FOSS (free and open
source software). The learning curve can be steep, but it's worth it.

I'm talking about craftsmanship in tech. Digital artistry. Make it impossible
for anyone to take your hard-won muscle memory away from you with the next
upgrade, license change, job switch and everything else keeping you on the
hamster wheel of tech. Think VSCode's going to be with you for life? Think
again. But what's it all emulating? What do they all go to great lengths to be
like? Linux and vim. It's a hard pill to swallow, but there it is.

There's a larger discussion here about Unix and portability of everything, and
a whole bad boy philosophy of yanking back the good stuff for the masses after
corporate greed appropriates it, as GE and Bell Labs almost did from Fernando
Corbat√≥ with Multics until still living national treasure Ken Thompson yanked
it back with Unix. That got absconded with once again by big tech, so Linus
Torvalds yanked it back with Linux, in an eternal repeating story.

Today, a smattering of the tools that they created and liberated can't be taken
away from you by vendor shenanigans because they're the very tools ***they***
have to use to build their own stuff. And with the exception of the C
programming language that takes a level of something that I seem to not have, I
find the others manageable over time with practice &amp; even the legendarily
difficult vim text editor that everyone builds the "mode" for in. Find out why.

I advocate Linux, Python, vim and git, collectively the LPvg as the minimum
viable platform for life. There's plenty of other stuff you can (and should)
take up in life for your day-job, as the right tool for the job or  whatever.
But having Linux, Python, vim and git in your back pocket future-proofs you and
makes you able to do stuff and be a valuable contributor in almost any
environment today and long into the future. Stick with me for LPvg!

Each of these tools is a potential rabbit hole in their own right, especially
Linux. But if you're resisting obsolescence with a vengeance, after you've
learned the basics with a version like Ubuntu or OpenSuse, you're going to want
to look at NixOS, the ultimate in infusing the spirit of the machine into new
hardware from now to forever. Even virtual machines and containers seem kind of
silly in comparison.
