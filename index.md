## Future-proofing w/ Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg)

Sense some change in the world? Of course! We're in the midst of another shift.
With AI it feels like the kind of thing humanity has never faced before, but
we've lived through the industrial, atomic and information ages. Humanity
adapts. It's not the first time a whole bunch of people had to change the way
they live and work, so join me up-close and personal as I forcibly recover
enough youthful neuroplacticity at a half-century old to adapt and thrive.

This site is about both that adaptation and preserving the advantages of old
muscle memory as a sort of secret weapon, using the learnings from my two now
decade-old projects to help make the transition into the new. Join me on this
adventure, where I'm essentially re-starting life in my mid-50s as I take on:

- **Linux, Python, vim & git**: Mastering the future-proof LPvg minimum subplatform
- **Re-acquiring Math Skills**: Picking up where my 1970s K-12 education let me down
- **Staying at the Top of My Field**: Protecting my earning capacity as I age

## The Persistence of Text Files and Code

It's all about text files and pushing bits around. Even after the rise of AI, it
will be the same thing. User interfaces may change, and the barriers for entry
will be lowered for the non-programmer, but all that interaction with AIs won't
absolve you from having to learn to code. It just makes initial sketches easier.
Complex things remain complex, and you will still have to think through that
complexity. 

And even if Jensen Huang says you won't have to learn to code, someone will have
to take those sketches and turn them into a cohesive whole, and that person will
be doing it with codeâ€”probably Python.

## The Hamster Wheel of Faddish Tech

The in-style, faddish tech resets every 5 to 10 years. If you're on that hamster
wheel, such as with modern JavaScript frameworks, you have to relearn, retrain,
and continuously migrate or abandon your old code bases. But when a fundamental
is hit, that tech hangs around like the pee in the pool of tech. 

No matter how AI changes the world, this stuff is here to stay unless the whole
pool of tech was drained and refilled, and that's not going to happen. When a
machine powers on, it's still going to go through a boot process, and you can
step in and take control at that point, making the machine do anything you want.

## Future-Proofing with LPvg Skills

If you have the muscle memory built up from years of practice in this slightly
lower-than-usual level of tech mastery, then you won't go obsolete. LPvg skills
won't be as sexy or perhaps even valuable in people's eyes as whatever is the
fad at the time, but it will make your skills forever relevant and give you an
alternative to the popular approaches, and even some level of freedom from the
vendors battling to lock you in. 

No matter how they jazz it up and what power-tool conveniences they build-in,
you'll notice an underlying system of Linux, Python, vim, and git even they're
relying on.

## Lessons from the Amiga: Loving the Abstractions

But it's not always smooth sailing. The carpet can be pulled out from under you,
no matter how well you prepare. The idea is to make smart choices, so a good
deal of what you know and the hard-won muscle memory and habits forever apply. 

I fell in love with a particular computer system called the Amiga Computer some
30 years ago and have been trying to recapture the magic ever since. I've come
to the conclusion that you should not fall in love with your hardware or the
particulars of your system. But if you can love some of the higher-level
abstractions that cut across time, space, and problem domains, you'll be okay.
