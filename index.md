This site is about the pursuit of timeless tools in tech that don't quite
require you being a genius nor outsourcing the entire job to AI. Isn't it
possible to have tools in tech that are a lot like woodworking, where you don't
need to re-learn a whole new set of tools every 5 or 10 years? I'm over 50 years
into this, and I've had tech reset on me a lot. And I'm not a management type.
I'm in it for the love of tools, getting into the zone between you and some
challenge.

Nothing sets you back more than everything changing around you, and you find
yourself unable to keep up with the next shiny new thing. And pretty soon, you
find yourself having to either switch into management, retire on your savings,
and generally no longer coding. Nonsense! Even when the AIs can code 99% for
you, that 1% that still has to be more precise than the spoken word needs to be
100% understood by you, so you still need that other 99%. Learn to code.

So, you still have got to learn to code Python. In almost the same breath as
Jensen Huang says you won't need to learn how to code, he says after you say it
in "human", AI will create the code. Of course you will have to look at it and
review it, he quickly adds. So guess what? That doesn't get you out of learning
how to program, and likely Python.

Learn to be comfortable with Python in many environments, but learn to make one
special environment you can call home throughout the years, no matter how your
hardware changes. This is a tall order, and a first step towards future-proofing
your skills in tech. You've got to find the free and open source (FOSS) parts to
build upon, so no matter how things change with products, vendors, or even the
rise of AI, things can not change so much as to make your tech skills
irrelevant. 

The alternative is to just yield to the vendors, Microsoft, Google, Amazon

This is the foundation of one of the grandest magic tricks of all. And that's
keeping that "at home" feeling that settles onto you as a developer learning
what "fixed position" resources you can rely on. 

I fell in love with the Amiga Computer over 30 years ago, and have been trying
to recapture the magic ever since. I've tried everything, and after much pain
and deliberation have come to the conclusion that you should not fall in love
with your hardware. Software on the other hand can stay with you for life and
never lets you down &#151; so long as it's well-chosen FOSS (free and open
source software). The learning curve can be steep, but it's worth it.

I'm talking about craftsmanship in tech. Digital artistry. Make it impossible
for anyone to take your hard-won muscle memory away from you with the next
upgrade, license change, job switch and everything else keeping you on the
hamster wheel of tech. Think VSCode's going to be with you for life? Think
again. But what's it all emulating? What do they all go to great lengths to be
like? Linux and vim. It's a hard pill to swallow, but there it is.
