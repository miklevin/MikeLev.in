## Future-proofing w/ Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg)

Saying AI has killed programming is like saying the calculator killed math.
Expert users still have to expertly use the tool for the value to be realized.
Whether or not you thriving and prosper or get ground under the wheels of
obsolescence is all in the details.

### The Hamster Wheel of Tech vs. Forever Improving

Everything you learn will be obsolete in a few years... except for certain
fundamentals that never go away. While the hamster wheel churn of tech is okay
in your neuro-flexible youth, as you get older skills setting into your habits
and muscle memory become either an asset or a liability.

Every once in a while, we embark on a journey of self-reinvention. In today's
rapidly evolving tech landscape, this journey often involves recalibrating our
skills and tools to stay relevant and productive. With the rise of AI and an
overwhelming array of new technologies, focusing on a core set of powerful,
flexible tools can provide a solid foundation for adapting to change.

## A Focused Approach to Tech Mastery

In light of the AI revolution and the flood of new tech offerings, I've chosen to concentrate on a specific set of tools and technologies:

- **Linux**: A versatile, open-source operating system that forms the backbone of much of the world's computing infrastructure.
- **Python**: A highly readable and versatile programming language, ideal for AI, data science, and general-purpose development.
- **Vim**: A powerful, customizable text editor that boosts productivity once mastered.
- **Git**: The industry-standard version control system, essential for collaborative development and project management.
- **Nix and NixOS**: An innovative package manager and Linux distribution that offers reproducible, declarative system configuration.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive environment for exploring and prototyping Python ideas.
- **FastHTML**: A modern web framework for quickly turning Python concepts into web applications.

This curated toolkit provides a robust platform for navigating the ever-changing
tech landscape without getting lost in a sea of proprietary solutions and
subscription-based services. Join the journey!
