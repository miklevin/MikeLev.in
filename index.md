Your tech skills go obsolete by design. Some free and open source software
(FOSS) tools don't change for decades (in a good way), allowing muscle memory
and craftsmanship to forever improve. Start building lifelong craftsmanship in
tech by <a href="https://mykoz.ai">running the Linux version of Python</a>.on
your local machine.

Future-proofing yourself on the Linux command-line can occur even while staying
on Windows. My hobby is helping people resist hopping on the hamster wheel of
obsolescence by focusing on the timeless tools of tech: Linux, Python, vim and
git (LPvg).  To this end, I have 2 popular projects: Levinux and Pipulate.
