description: By installing the Linux version of JupyterLab on Windows, you are running the same code on your computer as you can on all Linux servers. From there you ease your way into a lifetime of mindfulness and timeless skills by keeping a 1-text-file Journal in vim for the rest of your life.

You've heard of Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism? This is MyKoz.AI Real/OS and
Tow-it-ism; a way of using a Linux Subsystem on Windows for a minimalistic and
portable approach to computing.

I teach Python AI SEO with timeless skills that can apply to data science,
machine learning, and programming in general. Because I'm using daily
journaling in vim as a way to teach these skills, it's also a lesson in
mindfulness and minimalism. I call it Tow-it-ism, because you're towing a small
set of broadly applicable skills with you for the rest of your life.

Look, you could be using VSCode and be doing everything exactly the same way as
everyone else, beholden to a vendor's vision of what your future should be.
What I propose threatens the status quo. And I'm not going to lie to you, it's
going to be a lot of work. But if you're brave, you'll find yourself thinking
in 10-year increments, instead of being function of next quarter's profits.

## How It Works

This .bat script replaces the default Windows 10 or 11 Linux Subsystem Ubuntu
22.04 with a new one that has JupyterLab installed along with the latest
Python, NeoVim, and a few other goodies to get you started on your journey. If
you've been thinking of taking up skills that will last a lifetime in the areas
of programming, data science, and machine learning, this URL is the place to
start:

### MyKoz.AI Real/OS Installation Instructions

1. Copy the text below. Then create a file called `mykoz.bat` on your Windows
   10 or 11 desktop, save it, and double-click it. Note: Be sure to save it as
   a `.bat` file, not a `.txt` file. This sometimes takes going into Windows
   Explorer and turning off the option to hide common file extensions. Also,
   the double-click to run may require extra security steps.
2. This will download the installer, called `Jupyter Ubuntu.bat`. Run it to
   replace the default Windows Ubuntu 22.04 with one that hosts JupyterLab on
   Linux from the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). That's it! You new have
   JupyterLab running, which you can access by clicking the new `JupyterLab`
   Shortcut on your desktop.

### Copy/Paste This Code Into a File On Your Desktop

```bash
@echo off
setlocal enableDelayedExpansion
set "TIME=%TIME::=%"
set "TIME=%TIME:.=%"
set /a "T=%TIME%"
set "URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miklevin/mykoz/main/install.bat?cache=%T%"
set "FILENAME=Jupyter Ubuntu.bat"
curl -s -o "%FILENAME%" "%URL%" ^
    -H "Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" ^
    -H "Pragma: no-cache" ^
    -H "Expires: 0" ^
    --proxy-header "Cache-Control: no-cache" ^
    --proxy-header "Cache-Control: no-store"
```

## Details

If you haven't read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you should. In the words
of the Mouse, Mine is a long and sad tale. But it's also a tale of hope and
redemption. I'm going to teach you how to use Linux to improve forever.

## The Problem

The technology that really set-in and changed the world, beginning in 1970, the
same time and place I was born, is Unix. Unix solved problems of portability
and interoperability that held back the computer industry. Years later, the
Linux operating system liberated Unix. But consumer-facing tech like Windows
and Mac have been the primary way people interact with computers, devastating
tech careers through the churn of planned obsolescence.

## The Solution

The solution is to use Linux as a common denominator on all computers which now
have the ability to run Linux. This is the case with Windows 10 and 11, which
have a Linux Subsystem that can run Ubuntu 22.04. It is also the case with Mac
using Ubuntu's Multipass, and even Chromebooks using Crostini. You need only
put aside the concept of ***Desktop*** Linux. This is about the command line.
Yes, it's scary. But we're talking making your skills last for decades here.

## The Plan

Copy/pasting the above code starts the process of customizing the Linux
Subsystem on Windows 10 or 11. It primarily installs JupyterLab, providing the
bridge into the world of Linux by making all the Python code you generate Linux
cloud-ready. This initiates a little-known process called a "server build".
Once the server is built, you have customized the Linux Subsystem on Windows to
pave the way for a lifetime of learning and skills that will last forever.

# The Journey

There is also an automated Linux service that I set up running in the called
"WHIM" (With Help, I Monitor) which you update from a Jupyter Notebook, thus
bridging the gap between the command line and the GUI. If you've ever wondered
how to ***really*** automate Python code you write in Notebooks, this is it. So
we go from easy peasy Python in a browser to a genuine Linux systemd service.

# The Destination

You get this massive benefit right up front, but then everything necessary is
also in place to ease you into the most powerful and popular text editor in the
world, vim. Or more precisely, a "forked" derivative of vim called NeoVim which
you can start using for daily journaling, thus practicing without the pressure
of coding right away.

# The Reward

Lather, rinse, repeat, and you will be a master of the command line, and a
technical powerhouse sporting the same skills that run the world. No one can
take that away from you with a new version of Windows or Mac. And you might not
think so today, but the command-line can be a lot of fun. It gets committed to
your muscle memory, freeing up all your executive function for creativity.
